Of course there are many kinds of knives, and <strong>backpacking knives</strong> are s specific breed of knife.
<h2>Features of Backpacking Knives</h2>
Are you wondering what separates backpacking knives from other knives? Here are the essentials.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> First and foremost, backpacking knives are lightweight. There are all kinds of knives, big and small, but as with most other backpacking equipment, there is little point in taking a big heavy knife when you can make do with a small, lightweight knife.</li>
	<li><strong>Sharp -</strong> With any knife really, you want to make sure that it is sharp. This is less about selecting the right knife and more about maintaining your knife properly. A dull knife, no matter how big or small it is, is not nearly as useful as a sharp knife. If your knife does not come from the manufacturer with a good, sharp edge, then you should sharpen it right away.</li>
</ul><!--ads-->
<h2>Examples of Backpacking Knives</h2>
Here are a few examples of good backpacking knives.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-e-z-out-skeleton-knife\">Gerber E-Z Out Skeleton Knife</a> - Gerber is a very well known knife manufacturer that make a lot of great knives, big and small. The E-Z Out is a great backpacking knife <!--more-->because of its small size and lightweight design. It's a <strong>folding knife</strong>, which some people prefer, and is made with <strong>400 stainless steel</strong>. The weight is a very respectable <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>, so it's definitely not a knife that is going to slow you down. The <strong>blade is 3.5 inches long</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/802109/dajo-survivor-knife\">Dajo Survivor Knife</a> - It can be difficult to find a good, lightweight option when looking for a fixed blade backpacking knife, but the Dajo Survivor Knife does a good job of fitting that role. The blade is made with <strong>57-HRC stainless steel, and is 3.6 inches long</strong>. The handle also has a special notch on the back, which doubles as a strike point for a fire starter. It weighs <strong>6 ounces, which is 170 grams</strong>, so it's not the lightest backpacking knife, but for a fixed blade knife it's definitely not very heavy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peck-in-the-dark\">Columbia River Peck in the Dark</a> - If you want lightweight above everything else, the Columbia River Peck in the Dark is a great choice. It <strong>weighs a very slim .9 ounces, which is just 25 grams</strong>. The length is only <strong>1.88 inches</strong>, however, so it is not the biggest knife either. If you want lightweight, however, it does not get much lighter than this.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/737701/benchmade-556-mini-griptilian-serrated-locking-knife-olive\">Benchmade 556 Mini-Griptilian Serrated Locking Knife</a> - Benchmade is another very well known brand in the knife world. This particular benchmade knife features a <strong>coated, 154 CM stainless steel blade that is 2.9 inches in length</strong>. It's a <strong>folding knife</strong>, and weighs a <strong>very slim 2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>. The high quality steel prices this knife a little higher than the competition, but if you want quality this is a good choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Backpacking Knives</h2>
A backpacking knife is great, but there are a few alternatives that you might consider if you're not entirely sold on the idea of a backpacking knife.

One innovative alternative that comes from the lightweight backpacking community is a a razor blade. If you want to be able to cut stuff, but you don't want to carry any extra weight, a razor blade is a great way to accomplish just that.

Another good alternative to backpacking knives is a multi-tool. The <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-multi-tool-for-backpacking/\">best multi-tools</a> often feature a knife as well as many other tools and attachments that backpackers will find useful."

I've always thought that the best thing about winter backpacking is the snow. It transforms the whole landscape, and if nothing else, makes for a lot of great pictures and something a little different from the usual backpacking experience.

Of course one of the worst things about winter backpacking is, also, the snow. It gets you cold and wet, and makes getting anywhere a lot more effort. Fortunately, there is way to help with that, and it is snowshoes.
<h2>Backpacking Snowshoes</h2>
Snowshoes are a great investment if you plan to do any backpacking in the snow. I've personally done a few winter trips with <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-snowshoes/\">snowshoes</a>, and I can tell you that they are a whole lot of fun. The introduce a bit of novelty in to the whole backpacking experience, and make backpacking a little more interesting in general.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind, however, with snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Men and Women</strong> - Men's snowshoes and women's snowshoes really are different. A lot of<!--more--> the time, different versions of the same product for men and women is mostly marketing, but for snowshoes there really is a difference, and that difference has to do with weight. The surface area of a snowshoe is built to accommodate a certain amount of weight. The more weight there is, the more surface area on the snowshoe there has to be. Because men weigh more, on average, than women do, they need bigger snowshoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Backpacks</strong> - Related to the point above, when you take a backpack with you, you need to account for the extra weight of the backpack. If the weight of you and your backpack is too much for your snowshoes then you end up sinking right in, and the snowshoes become useless weight on your feet. No fun.</li>
</ul>
So it's important to get the right pair of snowshoes. Some of the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-snowshoes/\">best snowshoes</a> actually have removable tails that you can buy that make them ideal for backpackers looking to do a little winter backpacking. You put the tail on when you plan on going out with a backpack, to accommodate the extra weight. And if you want to go hiking, you take the tails off, to make the snowshoes lighter.

A lot of people tend to avoid things like winter camping and winter backpacking because it seems a little foreign and dangerous maybe. But with things like snowshoes, you can actually have a lot of fun out in the snow. And the best part is that you probably wont have to share the trail, or your campsite with anyone else."

Of course just as with any sleeping bag, there are some important decisions to make. Do you want a sleeping bag with down insulation, or will synthetic insulation do the trick. Do you want a rectangular shaped double sleeping bag, or is something with a more tapered shape right for you? Decisions, decisions.
<h2>Double Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when shopping for double sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Length -</strong> When getting a double sleeping bag you will need to make sure to get a sleeping bag that is long enough for the taller of the two people that are going to be using it. Of course the one major drawback is that if there is a big difference in heights, that leaves you with a lot of wasted space in the sleeping bag to heat up.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation Material -</strong> Double sleeping bags, just like the single person versions, come with either down insulation or synthetic insulation. Down is generally better, because it keeps you <!--more-->warm for less weight, but synthetic insulation will still keep you relatively warm when wet, while down wont.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Double Sleeping Bags</h2>
The very best in double sleeping bag technology.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778962/the-north-face-twin-peaks-20-sleeping-bag-double-wide-long\">The North Face Twin Peaks +20 Sleeping Bag</a> - The Twin Peaks is a <strong>synthetic</strong> double sleeping bag, <strong>rated for +20 temperatures</strong>. It comes with <strong>two zippers</strong>, so that either person can get in and out without disturbing the other sleeper. What stands out about the Twin Peaks, however, is that it has a <strong>tapered design</strong>, which helps keep the weight down and leaves less room for cold spots. The Twin Peaks <strong>weighs 5 pounds, 13 ounces, or 2.64 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/king-solomon-15-double-bag-650-down\">Big Agnes King Solomon 15 Double Bag</a> - The King Solomon is a double sleeping bag with a <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, as the name suggests. It's insulated with <strong>600 fill down, rather than synthetic insulation</strong>, which helps to save on weight and also makes it more compressible, for fitting in to a backpack. It also comes with <strong>two separate zippers</strong> for each sleeper. The King Solomon <strong>weighs 5 pounds, 3 ounces, or 2.35 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-dream-island-sleeping-bag-15-degree-synthetic\">Big Agnes Dream Island Sleeping Bag</a> - The Dream Island is another double sleeping bag from manufacturer Big Agnes. This one is also <strong>rated to 15 degrees, but is synthetic</strong>, whereas the King Solomon is down. Because the Dream Island is synthetic it costs less than the King Solomon, but also weighs quite a bit more, at <strong>9 pounds 5 ounces, or 4.22 kilograms</strong>. So a good choice for car camping, but definitely not for anything that involves a backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Double Sleeping Bags</h2>
Double sleeping bags are a good way to get cozy, but definitely not a good way to save on weight. If you are car camping you probably wont be too concerned about this, but if you have to carry your sleeping bag for any length of time, then how much it weighs will probably be important to you. Two single sleeping bags can actually weigh a lot less than some of these doubles, which you can see for yourself at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">compare sleeping bags</a> page."

It's rare that anyone goes camping or backpacking by themselves, in which case a 2 man tent can cut down on weight. But at the same time, if you do ever end up going backpacking or camping by yourself, a 2 man tent is just a roomy version of a 1 man tent, and perfectly suited to traveling alone with. But as with any tent, there are a few thing to keep in mind when shopping for 2 man tents.
<h2>2 Man Tent</h2>
What to look for when reviewing 2 man tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> When you're camping or backpacking you have to carry everything, including the tent, and if you are carrying your tent, it might as well be a lightweight tent. The main <!--more-->advantage of a 2 man tent over two 1 man tents is the weight savings, so you might as well maximize those weight savings by getting a lightweight 2 man tent.</li>
	<li><strong>Floor Space -</strong> With two people sharing a tent, your main concern is always going to be floor space. You don't want to have excessive amounts of floor space, but neither do you want too little floor space, unless you're really fond of the person you're sharing a tent with.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 2 Man Tents</h2>
The very best 2 man tents on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-2-2-person-tent\">Terra Nova Laser Photon 2 Tent</a> - This 2 man tent from UK manufacturer Terra Nova is the <strong>lightest 2 man tent on the list, at 1 pound 15 ounces, or 935 grams</strong>. It is also the smallest on the list, with <strong>26 square feet of floor space</strong>. So if you want lightweight and don't mind getting cozy, it's an ideal choice. Terra Nova even designed their own, special 1 gram tent pegs to go with their tents, so you know they're a company focused on saving you weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 Tent</a> - The Fly Creek UL2 <strong>won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award in 2010</strong>, in part because it has such an impressive weight. At <strong>2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong> it's not quite as light as the Laser Photon, but it beats out just about every other 2 man tent on the market. It also gives you <strong>28 square feet of floor space</strong>, as opposed to the 26 of the Laser Photon, so slightly more roomy. One thing to note is that the door is at the head of the tent, rather than the side like the other two tents on this list, so you don't have to crawl over anyone to enter and exit the tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-carbon-reflex-2-tent-2-person-3-season\">MSR Carbon Reflex 2 Tent</a> - One more very lightweight 2 man tent, this time from MSR. The Carbon Reflex <strong>weighs 2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1275 grams</strong>, so not quite as light as the other two, but lighter than the majority of 2 man tents. It also has <strong>40 square feet of floor space</strong>, so slightly roomier than the other two. <strong>One notable feature is carbon fiber poles</strong>, which is a lightweight material that is still quite strong.</li>

Backpacks for backpacking are typically a little bigger, to accommodate all that extra gear that you need to survive in the outdoors. Ideally, a backpacking backpack will also be a little lighter, because after all, you will be carrying that backpack for quite some time.
<h2>Backpacking Backpack</h2>
What to look for when looking at backpacking backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Ideally, a backpacking backpack should be a lightweight backpack. Remember that you have to carry everything in your backpack, and you have to carry the backpack too. There is no sense in carrying a heavy backpack when a lighter backpack will do the same job. Your back and legs will thank you at the end of the day.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity -</strong> Backpacking tends to require a little more gear than something like hiking, for example. For that reason, a good backpacking backpack will tend to be a little<!--more--> larger than something like a hiking backpack. Exactly how big, however, will depend a lot on how long you plan to go backpacking for.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Backpack</h2>
All the best backpacking backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824361/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-pack\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60 Pack</a> -The Blaze won the <strong>2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, making it one of the premier backpacks currently on the market. It has <strong>60 liters of storage capacity</strong>, and has all the standard features, like an internal frame and a padded hip belt. It's a top loading backpack, but does not have a sleeping bag compartment at the bottom like you will find on many backpacking backpacks. But it also only weighs <strong>2 pounds 14 ounces, or 1.3 kilograms</strong>, which definitely qualifies it as a lightweight backpack. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824384/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-ki-pack-womens\">women's version</a> of the Blaze.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit Backpack</a> - ULA Equipment is a company that many backpackers have probably never heard of, but they are extremely popular with lightweight backpackers. The Circuit, which has a <strong>68 liter capacity</strong>, weighs a very slight <strong>36 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, making it both bigger and significantly lighter than the already very light Blaze above. Features like <strong>large exterior pockets</strong> for easy access to water bottles and <strong>hip belt pockets</strong> for things you don't have to take your bag off to access help further set the Circuit apart from the crowd. If you want lightweight, this is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-argon-85-backpack-5100-5500cu-in\">Osprey Argon 85 Backpack</a> - If you need something big, the Argon is a great choice. At <strong>85 liters</strong>, it has enough room to carry gear for just about any kind of backpacking trip. All that capacity comes at a price, however, which is weight. The Argon <strong>weighs in at 6 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.92 kilograms</strong>, which is quite a bit more than either of the other two backpacks. A few features like a <strong>removable lid and day pack, sleeping bag compartment and multiple access points to the main compartment</strong> help to offset the larger weight. If you want high capacity but are reluctant to strap 6 pounds to your back, check out ULA Equipment's full range of backpacks for a few that are bigger than the Circuit.</li>

You have inflatable sleeping pads and then you have the <strong>foam sleeping pad</strong> selection. There are a couple advantages to using foam or inflatable, the most obvious being that you cant puncture a foam sleeping pad. They also take a lot less work to set up, and can also be extremely lightweight, which is a nice touch for backpackers.
<h2>Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
Features to look for on foam sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Design -</strong> There are a couple different design patterns to choose from when you're shopping for foam sleeping pads. The familiar egg shell pattern, for instance, provides plenty of cushion, while other designs, like ridges, provide the same thing, just in a different way. The difference is largely one of preference.</li>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> You might think that all foam sleeping pads are more or less the same, but there are actually a few different kinds of foam available with foam <!--more-->sleeping pads, each with their own positives and negatives to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
The very best foam sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sleeping-giant-pad-upgrade-kit\">Big Agnes Giant Pad</a> - This sleeping pad is something a little different. It's actually made of <strong>memory foam</strong>, so it conforms to your body and gives you a slightly different kind of camping sleep experience. It's <strong>1 inch thick</strong>, and comes in a variety of sizes and shapes, with the average weight being about <strong>43 ounces, or 1226 grams</strong>. So it's not light, but it would certainly be comfortable. Also has an <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">R-value</a> of 3.5.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810386/therm-a-rest-ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest RidgeRest SOlite Pad</a> - The RidgeRest, true to its name, is designed with parallel ridges down the length of the sleeping pad. It also has an <strong>aluminized surface, to help reflect body heat</strong> back at you while you sleep. Speaking of body heat, the RidgeRest has an <strong>R-value of 2.8. It also weighs 19 ounces, or 540 grams for the regular length version</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z-Lite Sleeping Pad</a> - The Z-Lite has the very popular <strong>egg carton design</strong>, which helps to trap in warm air, and is quite comfortable to sleep on. The Z-Lite has an <strong>R-value of only 2.2</strong>, so not quite as warm as the other two foam sleeping pads, but it does <strong>weigh just 14.5 ounces, or 410 grams for the regular length</strong>, so you do save a certain amount of weight for that reduced R-value.</li>

And if you are having to carry it, there is no reason to carry a heavy backpacking stove when there are many excellent lightweight backpacking stoves available. Lighten your load a little and get a lightweight backpacking stove.</li>
	<li><strong>Fuel Source -</strong> You have a couple of different fuel sources to choose from when shopping for backpacking stoves. The<!--more--> two big ones are canisters and liquid gases, but there are others, like solid fuels and even plain old wood, that you should definitely consider when shopping for a new backpacking stove.</li>

<h2>Best Backpacking Stove Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the better backpacking stoves.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768603/snow-peak-litemax-stove\">Snow Peak LiteMax Stove</a> - At a mere <strong>2 ounces, or 53 grams</strong>, the LiteMax is one light backpacking stove. It's a <strong>canister stove</strong>, so you will have to add the weight of one or more canisters to that, but still, impressively lightweight. This is a fairly basic unit, but it will boil your water and cook your food just fine, and you cant argue with that weight. If you have a preference for canister stoves, this is a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gramcracker-titanium-solid-fuel-kit\">Trail Designs GramCracker</a> - Many people will probably never have heard of solid fuel, which is also sometimes called Esbit tabs, but they are a small chunk of material that will burn for quite a while when lit. The GramCracker will hold these tabs, and at just <strong>.1 ounces, or 3 grams</strong>, you will never even know you're carrying it. You have to factor the weight of the Esbit tabs in to that, and maybe a few accessories, like a wind screen, but still, an <strong>incredibly light backpacking stove</strong> option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-simmerlite-stove\">MSR SimmerLite Stove</a> - The SimmerLite is another very lightweight stove, this time for <strong>liquid fuels</strong>, more specifically white gas. It <strong>weighs 8.5 ounces, or 240 grams</strong>, which is still very light for a good backpacking stove. So if you like the reusability of liquid fuel containers, the SimmerLite is a great option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-hexagon-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon Wood Stove</a> - One last backpacking stove option, this time using <strong>wood as a fuel source</strong>. The great thing about wood is that there's no need to drag your fuel around with you, apart from maybe a few starting materials. Of course you may have to deal with fire bans, or wet wood, or even a lack of wood, but as long as you have a good idea of the conditions you are going in to, wood stoves are a great option for backpackers. This particular one is a simple enough hexagon, which <strong>weighs 4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>.</li>

Primarily, a backpacking stove should be a lightweight stove, because why carry a heavy stove in your backpack when you could be carrying a light stove instead?
<h2>Backpacking Stove</h2>
Here is what to look for from a backpacking stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> As mentioned above, a good backpacking stove is a lightweight stove. There are a lot of ways that manufacturers trim weight from their stoves, by using lighter materials, for instance, or getting rid of excess material, but generally the lighter the stove is, the better it will be for backpacking.</li>
	<li><strong>Fuel Source -</strong> When looking at backpacking stoves, you cant forget that you will have to carry your fuel too. When it comes to stoves you have four major choices, which are canister stoves, liquid stoves, alcohol stoves and wood stoves. There are a few<!--more--> others, like solid fuel stoves, but those are the big categories. Interestingly, with a wood stove you don't have to carry any fuel, because your fuel is waiting for you at your campsite. Or at least you hope it is.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Stove</h2>
Here are a few of the best backpacking stoves.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gramcracker-titanium-solid-fuel-kit\">Trail Designs GramCracker</a> - One of the most overlooked fuel sources is <strong>solid fuel</strong>, also sometimes known as Esbit tablets. The best thing about GramCracker, however, is the weight, which is <strong>just .1 ounces, or 3 grams</strong>. You will have to carry the tablets as well, but they are quite light too, so what you end up with is an <strong>extremely lightweight backpacking stove</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768603/snow-peak-litemax-stove\">Snow Peak LiteMax</a> - The LiteMax is one of the <strong>lighter canister stoves</strong> on the market. It weighs just <strong>1.87 ounces, or 53 grams</strong>, which will make it one of the lightest things in your backpack. Remember that you will have to carry the canisters as well, however.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-simmerlite-stove\">MSR SimmerLite</a> - The SimmerLite is a liquid fuels stove, and more specifically, a <strong>white gas stove</strong>. It weighs <strong>8.47 ounces, or 247 grams</strong>, so not quite as lightweight as some of the other options listed, but if you prefer a liquid burning stove, the SimmerLite is a great option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-hexagon-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - If you want to leave the fuel bottles at home, there is always the option to burn <strong>wood</strong> to heat your meals. The Titanium Hexagon is exactly as described, a titanium hexagon that folds down when not in use. You put the wood inside the hexagon, the pot on top, and away you go. The weight is a very slim <strong>4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>, so you definitely wont be carrying much gear, and remember that you wont have to carry any fuel, beyond some matches and a bit of starter material like a cotton ball, just in case.</li>

The one exception to that might be using a tarp, but with tents, you are looking at 15 pounds of tent, give or take a few pounds depending on the specific model.
<h2>6 Man Tent</h2>
Here is what to look for in a six man tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ventilation -</strong> With 6 people sleeping in one small space, ventilation is going to be one of your biggest issues. With that in mind, you should be looking for a <!--more-->tent that has good ventilation, so that you can be reasonably sure you're not going to wake up soaked in condensation in the morning.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra Space -</strong> People tend to like to bring a few things, like a flashlight or a few pieces of warming clothing, in to the tent with them, if not more gear. When it's just you or you and one other person this isn't such a big deal, but all those extras for 6 people adds up. Try to find a tent with some storage areas on the sides of the tent, or at least some extra space, so that you're not crammed in like sardines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 6 Man Tent</h2>
Here are a few of the best 6 man tents.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/halo-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Marmot Halo 6</a> - Based on reviews, this seems to be the <strong>most popular 6 man tent</strong> currently on the market. First, it has <strong>two separate doors</strong>, which does nothing to keep weight down, but does make it so you don't have to go crawling all over other people if you have to get up during the night. It also has <strong>adjustable side ventilation and gear storage pockets on the walls</strong>. The abundance of features, however, means that you have <strong>18 pounds 15 ounces, or 8.59 kilograms</strong> of tent to carry around. Fine if you are car camping, but perhaps not the best option for backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/kelty-trail-ridge-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Kelty Trail Ridge 6</a> - The great thing about this tent is the weight. For a 6 man tent it is actually <strong>reasonably light, at 13 pounds 13 ounces, or 6.26 kilograms</strong>. Beyond that, the Trail Ridge 6 has <strong>two doors</strong>, for easier entry and exit, and <strong>storage to make sure that there isn't a whole mess of gear on the floor</strong>. One additional feature worth mentioning is <strong>noiseless zippers</strong>, so you don't have to worry about waking everyone up with your midnight trip to the bathroom.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777768/rei-kingdom-6-tent\">REI Kingdom 6</a> - The main thing that stands out about the Kingdom 6 is that is has a <strong>separator wall</strong> that can be zipped down, to turn the 6 man tent in to a 2 room tent. The separator wall increases the wall storage space available, and the <strong>2 doors</strong> mean that you you don't have to worry about going through the separator wall during the night. It does weigh <strong>17 pounds 3 ounces, or 7.8 kilograms</strong>, so again a tent better suited for car camping.</li>

You will need to carry all of your camping gear, for one, and you will need to carry all that camping gear without ending up with a serious back problem when you get to the campsite.
<h2>Camping Backpacks</h2>
Here are features to look for on <strong>camping backpacks</strong>.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Everything else being equal, it is better to have a light backpack, instead of a heavy backpack. Would you rather be carrying 20 pounds or 25 pounds? Believe it or not the difference in the weight of backpacks really can be that big, depending on what models and manufacturers you are looking at.</li>
	<li><strong>Internal Frame, or Not -</strong> Depending on how much weight you are carrying, it is also important to get an internal frame. Generally, if you are carrying anything above 30 pounds, you<!--more--> will need a backpack with an internal frame. But if you can get the weight of your backpack down below 30 pounds you can get a camping backpack that has no frame, or that has a removable frame, which further lightens your load.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Backpacks</h2>
These are some of the best camping backpacks currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/catalyst.asp\">ULA Catalyst</a> - If you want a big camping backpack that is also a lightweight backpack, the Catalyst is a great choice. The ULA brand may not be familiar to most campers, but it is well known and respected by lightweight backpackers. The bags are<strong> made in the USA and are reasonably priced</strong>. The Catalyst has an <strong>internal frame</strong> and a long list of features, including a <strong>75 liter capacity</strong>. And you get all that for just <strong>47 ounces, or 1332 grams</strong>. If you want lightweight and fully featured, this is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam</a> - GoLite is another lightweight backpack manufacturer. The Jam is one of their smaller backpacks, coming in at <strong>50 liters</strong>, which is still fairly large, and enough room for a smaller camping trip. The backpack weighs a very reasonable <strong>30 ounces, or 840 grams</strong>, so you don't have to carry a lot. The Jam does not have a frame, but with the smaller size you probably wont be able to cram too much in to it anyway, so that should not be much of a problem.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/exos-46-pack-2800-cu-in\">Osprey Exos 46</a> - the Exos 46 is another relatively small camping backpack that is well suited to a short camping trip or to campers that like to only take a minimal amount of gear. It has a <strong>46 liter capacity, and weighs 37 ounces, or 1050 grams</strong>. You do, however, get an <strong>internal frame</strong> to help with the load, which partially explains the extra weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60</a> - The Blaze A.C. 60 is a newer backpack from Granite Gear that <strong>won the 2011 Editor's Choice Award from Backpacker magazine</strong>. It has a <strong>60 liter capacity</strong>, so a reasonable amount of room for your camping gear, and weighs <strong>45 ounces, or 1300 grams</strong>. An <strong>internal frame</strong> helps, and if you want a backpack from a well known brand, this is an ideal choice, but for only 32 grams more, the 15 extra liters of storage capacity that the ULA Catalyst has is very attractive.</li>

If you do carry trekking poles, then a <strong>trekking pole tent</strong> will allow you leave your tent poles at home and use your trekking poles in their place.
<h2>Trekking Pole Tent</h2>
If you plan on getting a trekking pole tent, here are a few things to keep in mind.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bigger Footprint -</strong> Trekking pole tents, by virtue of their design, tend to have a fairly large footprint, and are usually not free-standing. If you are camping in the back country, where space is no problem, this is fine, but you might run in to a few problems with a small campsite.</li>
	<li><strong>Location Matters -</strong> Trekking pole tents are also not as stable as most other tents. If you pick a spot for your tent well, then this shouldn't be a problem, but a good wind storm, for instance, can flatten a trekking pole tent with ease.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Of course these potential disadvantages are offset by the big positive associated with trekking <!--more-->pole tents, which is that they are typically quite lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Trekking Pole Tent</h2>
Here are a few of the best trekking pole tents.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - Tarptent makes a whole bunch of excellent trekking pole compatible tents, but one of their most popular 1 person tents is the Contrail. The <strong>bathtub floor</strong> is spacious, as is the ceiling height, and the ventilation it provides is more than enough to keep moisture out of the single wall design. The <strong>adjustable pitch even makes it a viable option for weathering a storm or two</strong>, assuming you have pitched it with the correct orientation to begin with. You even get a <strong>small vestibule</strong> to store gear in. And all that for <strong>24.5 ounces, or 695 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/shelter/hexamid.shtml\">ZPacks Hexamid Solo</a> - What stands out about the Hexamid Solo immediately is the weight. You get a tent that offers full protection from insects and the elements for just <strong>8.35 ounces, or 237 grams, which is really an amazing weight</strong>. However, you have to sacrifice longevity to get there. The Hexamid solo is made from <strong>cuben fiber</strong>, which is a fabric used more often for sails. It tends to degrade with prolonged sun exposure, however, and given enough hours, the seams will start to fall apart. But that's only after thousands of hours of sun exposure, and even then, a little duct tape fixes everything. Still, it's something to be aware of before purchasing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/tarp-shelter-1\">Terra Nova Equipment Tarp Shelter 1</a> - If you're not worried about insects then a tarp might be an ideal form of tent for you. The Tarp Shelter 1 from UK manufacturer Terra Nova is just one of many excellent tarps currently on the market. <strong>You can make a wide variety of shapes with the tarp and your trekking poles, such as a lean-to or an A-frame, that will protect you from the elements</strong>. Best of all, the Tarp Shelter weighs just <strong>6.28 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>, so you save a lot of weight with this option. Just beware that you wont be protected from the bugs if you go this route.</li>

It makes you wonder how our ancestors ever got by. But with a <strong>camping water filter</strong> you can be reasonably sure that contaminated water will not be your downfall when you head out in to the wild.
<h2>Camping Water Filter</h2>
Here are some features to look for from camping water filters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Filter Type -</strong> There are actually a few different filter types out there on the market. There is the standard pump filter, that most people will no doubt be familiar with, but there are also filters that work via suction and a few that use gravity too. Depending on what kind of camping you are doing, any of these types might be suitable.</li>
	<li><strong>Replacement Window -</strong> Virtually all filters have parts that need to be replaced at some point. If the carbon in your pump filter needs to be replaced every 80 or 100 liters, for <!--more-->instance, and you are responsible for the filtering of water for a group of people, you may need to take replacement filters with you on a longer trip. It's something to keep in mind when shopping for a camping water filter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Water Filter</h2>
A few of the very best camping water filters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">Hydro Photon SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - This is not, strictly speaking, a water filter. It is more correctly called a <strong>water purifier</strong>. The SteriPEN uses <strong>UV light</strong> to kill everything bad in the water, rather than filter it out, like everything else on this list. It's certainly a lightweight option, at just <strong>3.64 ounces, or 103 grams</strong>, and while you will not have to replace the the bulb very often, you will have to contend with batteries.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720265/katadyn-hiker-pro-water-filter\">Katadyn Hiker PRO</a> - The Hiker PRO is a traditional <strong>pump filter</strong>, that weighs in at <strong>10.9 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>. It has a few great features, like a <strong>cleanable filter protector</strong> to extend filter life when you don't have a replacement handy, that makes it a great option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hyperflow-water-filter\">MSR HyperFlow Water Filter</a> - the HyperFlow is another pump filter option. It won an <strong>Editor's Choice Award from Backpacker magazine back in 2008</strong>, and it's design has only improved since then. It weighs <strong>7.8 ounces, or 221 grams</strong>, so noticeably lighter than the Hiker PRO.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-works-filter\">Platypus Gravity Works Filter</a> - The Gravity Works filter is something a little different. <strong>Whereas most filters use your pumping action to push water through the filter, the Gravity Works lets gravity do the work for you</strong>. At a <strong>filter rate of 1.75 Liters per minute</strong>, you wont have to wait long for your water to filter either. And the upside is that you don't have to do the pumping. The entire system also only <strong>weighs 10.7 ounces, or 304 grams</strong>, which is not the lightest option on this list, but not the heaviest either.</li>

Which is a shame, because the amount of weight you can save by leaving your tent at home and taking a bivy bag instead is significant. But as with any piece of backpacking or camping gear, there are a few things you should know about <strong>bivy bags</strong> before jumping in.
<h2>Bivy Bags</h2>
Be aware of the following when looking for a bivy bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing -</strong> There are a wide variety of materials that bivy bags are made with, and some of them are more waterproof than others. Many bivy bags also use a different material on the top and bottom, the reasoning being that the top and bottom of the bivy bag are exposed to water in different ways.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Protection -</strong> Almost all bivy bags come with some sort of opening where your face is, which is often how you get in and out of the bivy bag and also how you breath at night. Many<!--more-->, but not all bivy bags come with bug protection over this area. If you expect bugs, you may want to make sure that your bivy bag has this feature.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bivy Bags</h2>
Here are just a few of the very best bivy bags on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/integral-designs-south-col-bivy\">Integral Designs South Col</a> - At <strong>22.2 ounces or 630 grams</strong>, the South Col is not the lightest bivy bag on the market. And it also <strong>lacks a bug enclosure</strong> to keep the critters away from your face at night. But what you do get with the South Col is <strong>complete eVent enclosure</strong>. eVent is a breathable waterproof material similar to Gore-Tex, and a great option for something like a bivy bag. So if you want to stay dry above and beyond everything else, the South Col is a good option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/moonlite-bivi-sack\">Terra Nova Equipment Moonlite</a> - The Moonlite is on the <strong>lighter end of the bivy bag spectrum, at 6.3 ounces, or 180 grams</strong>. Best of all, the Moonlite is <strong>waterproof</strong> at that very slim weight, though like the South Col it <strong>lacks a bug enclosure</strong> to keep mosquitoes and other similar things away from your face at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&amp;products_id=30\">Mountain Laurel Designs Superlight Bivy</a> - The Superlight has it all, in terms of features. It's <strong>bug proof</strong>, so you are safe from mosquitoes, no-see-ums and everything else at night. It also has <strong>waterproof bottom and water resistant top</strong>, to give you plenty of protection from rain and moisture throughout the night. And all that for just <strong>6.8 ounces, or 195 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Adding Functionality to Bivy Bags</h2>
Bivy bags are a great way to stay dry, but sometimes you need to add a little bit of functionality to them. For starters, if your bivy bag does not provide you with protection from bugs, you can easily add that functionality with a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-insect-shield-mosquito-head-net\">insect shield heat net</a>. You can also use the head net during the day while around camp or walking on the trail.

If you are worried about the waterproofing on your bivy bag, there is a simple and lightweight fix for that too. By taking along a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">lightweight tarp</a> you always have the option to set the tarp up, which will take care of all or most of the moisture falling on you, and then your bivy will be more than able to handle the rest.

<h2>Camping Knives</h2>
Here are a few things that you should look for from camping knives.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> If your not car camping, and you're actually carrying a backpack for some length of time, then there is no reason to haul around a big heavy knife when you can make do with a lightweight camping knife.</li>
	<li><strong>Folding or Fixed -</strong> There are benefits and drawbacks to both folding and fixed blade knives. Folding knives are generally smaller and lighter, but are also weaker, whereas fixed blade knives are much stronger, but typically also heavier.</li>
	<li><strong>Serrated -</strong> One feature that is nice<!--more--> to have on a camping knife is a bit of a serrated edge. That way, you have more options for doing your cutting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Knives</h2>
A few of the very best camping knives.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Gerber Big Rock</a> - Gerber makes a lot of great knives, and the Big Rock is the perfect example. It is a <strong>fixed length knife with a 4.5 inch blade</strong>, and has a <strong>serrated edge</strong> to give you cutting options. It weighs <strong>6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>, which is not especially light for a camping knife, but it is a <strong>thick, solid knife that you wont ever have to worry about breaking</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-e-z-out-skeleton-knife\">Gerber E-Z Out Skeleton</a> - The E-Z Out occupies the opposite end the spectrum from the Big Rock. It is a <strong>folding knife with a 3.5 inch blade</strong>. It also has a <strong>serrated edge</strong>, which is a great feature to have for camping. And the weight is only <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>, which is far lighter than the Big Rock.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peck-in-the-dark\">Columbia River Peck in The Dark</a> - If you just want something that's <strong>lightweight</strong>, the Peck in the Dark is an ideal choice. It weighs just <strong>.9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>, which is light enough that you wont even know it's there until you need it. It's a <strong>folding knife, and the blade is only 1.88 inches</strong>, but for that small an amount of weight you cant expect to get a lot of knife.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Camping Knives</h2>
If you like the idea of a camping knife, but need more functionality, a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-multi-tool-for-backpacking/\">multi-tool</a> may be what you are looking for. Just about every multi-tool comes with a blade of some sort, plus a whole host of other handy tools that may come in handy while camping.

And for those who think even the Peck in the Dark is too much knife to have to carry around, an option sometimes employed by lightweight backpackers is to just carry a razor blade around with you. If you need to cut something, the razor blade will suffice, and it weighs next to nothing."

For women, there are a few variations in the design and size of hiking boots that make certain boots more or less suitable as <strong>women's hiking boots</strong>.
<h2>Womens Hiking Boots</h2>
Here are a few things to look out for when buying your next pair of hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> I'm a bit biased when it comes to weight, but there is no reason that you should wear heavy hiking boots when you could be wearing lightweight hiking boots instead. Every pound on your feet is roughly equivalent to 5 pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure. Would you go hiking with 10 pound weights in your backpack?</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing vs Breathability -</strong> Waterproof and breathable tend to be on two ends of  sliding scale. You can usually get one, but not both. Some materials, like Gore-Tex liners<!--more-->, can do a half decent job of giving you both, but it's always going to be a bit of a choice between the two.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Womens Hiking Boots</h2>
These are some of the best hiking boots on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/kailash-gtx-boot-women-s\">Scarpa Kailash GTX Boot</a> - The Kailash boots from Scarpa won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award back in 2008</strong>, and the design has not changed much since, and they are still a fantastic women's hiking boot. A <strong>Gore-Tex liner and Vibram sole</strong> stand out, but what will really sell you on these boots is the weight, which is <strong>just 19 ounces, or 540 grams</strong>. Very lightweight for a pair of hiking boots. You will feel like you're not even wearing boots.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/772566/keen-targhee-ii-mid-hiking-boots-womens\">Keen Targhee II Mid Hiking Boots</a> - The Targhee are a <strong>lower cut hiking boot</strong>, and if you're not looking for something with full ankle support, these are an ideal choice. They weigh <strong>30 ounces, which translates to 850 grams</strong>, so not as light as the Kailash above, but not extremely heavy either. The leather and mesh upper, in combination with <strong>Keen's own waterproof membrane</strong> helps to keep your feet dry. They're also comfortable right out of the box for most users, and the front toe guard is a bonus if you're the kind of person that rips up the front of a hiking shoe with regular abuse.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/asolo-stynger-gtx-hiking-boot-womens\">Asolo Stynger Gore-Tex Boot</a> - These are a bigger, heavier duty kind of hiking boot that would be <strong>suitable for things like scree fields and winter hiking, in addition to regular trails</strong>. But that toughness comes at a price, which is weight. The Styngers weigh in at <strong>2.43 pounds, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>. Definitely not light, but at the same time, lighter than many other tough hiking boots.</li>

But before you can stuff your face with the good stuff, you need to cook it, and that often involves <strong>camping pans</strong>.
<h2>Camping Pans</h2>
Features to watch for when looking for camping pans.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> The weight of your camping pans will largely be determined by the material they are made out of. And if you have to carry those pans around in your backpack, you <!--more-->should care very much about their weight. Titanium is typically the lightest, though it is also typically the most expensive.</li>
	<li><strong>Size -</strong> You also want to pay attention to how big the pan you are buying. If you will be needing to cook for two, then a single serving pan probably wont cut it. Similarly, make sure your pan is big enough for the kinds of foods you like to cook. You will be very disappointed if you get to cooking and realize your Mr. Noodles doesn't fit in your pan.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pans</h2>
A few of the very best camping pans you will find on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783955/msr-flex-skillet\">MSR Flex Skillet</a> - The Flex Skillet is a <strong>non-stick, aluminum pan</strong> ideal for cooking a wide variety of meals in. It has a <strong>9 inch diameter and 2.5 inch depth</strong>, which gives you plenty of space to cook up a good meal. It <strong>weighs 7 ounces, or 198 grams</strong>, and comes with a <strong>removable handle</strong> that clips in to an exterior bracket. The <strong>teflon coated interior makes the Flex very easy to clean</strong>, but be sure not to scratch it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/exo-2-pot-set-1\">MSR Duralite Frypan</a> - The Duralite frying pan is much like the Flex skillet above, but <strong>lacks an exterior bracket for a handle</strong>. This is ideal if you have your own handle already, but this is also a <strong>teflon coated camping pan</strong>, and so you will not want to scratch it at all, with a metal handle, for instance. It's also slightly smaller than the Flex, at only <strong>7.2 inches in diameter</strong>, but also weighs a bit less, at <strong>5.4 ounces, or 153 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-trek-1400-titanium-cookset\">Snow Peak Trek 1400 Titanium Cookset</a> - If you want versatility, the 1400 Cookset is perfect for you. It's a <strong>pot and lid set, but the lid also doubles as a pan</strong>. As the name suggests, it's <strong>titanium</strong>, and the complete <strong>set weighs 7.4 ounces, or 210 grams</strong>. The pan is a fair bit smaller than the other two from MSR, however, at <strong>5.75 inches across and 1.5 inches deep</strong>. It's more of a single serving, whereas the other two could conceivably hold two portions, but you get more versatility and less weight, which is a real bonus. It's also <strong>not non-stick</strong>, though titanium holds up well to a vigorous cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessories for Your Camping Pans</h2>
With most metal pot grippers you run the risk of scratching your teflon coated pans. If you have titanium then you don't to worry, but if you do have a telfon pan that does not have a built in handle, like the MSR Duralite above, then you might be interested in the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/microgripper\">GSI Microgripper</a>.

And for cooking in your telfon coated pans without scratching them up, there is the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814695/msr-alpine-spatula\">MSR Alpine Spatula</a>, though non-metal utensils would work equally well."

And for some getting a good nights sleep without a pillow is difficult to impossible. Whatever the case, there is a <strong>camping pillow</strong> for you.
<h2>Camping Pillow</h2>
What to look for when looking for a camping pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> If you are car camping then this isn't all that applicable, but for those that have to carry their gear, weight will matter. Pillows don't weigh much, but then they really are a luxury item, and the last thing you want is to be weighted down by luxury items.</li>
	<li><strong>Size -</strong> Similar to the point above, those who have to carry their gear will not want an overly large pillow taking up all kinds of their room in their backpack. A small pillow, or better yet<!--more--> a compressible pillow will minimize space taken up in your backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pillow</h2>
A selection of the best camping pillows available.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - Just like there are inflatable and foam sleeping pads, so too are there inflatable and foam pillows. This pillow from Mont Bell falls under the <strong>inflatable</strong> category. The benefits of an inflatable pillow is that they <strong>pack down extremely small</strong>, and can be made a variety of thicknesses. And it <strong>weighs just 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>, which is hard to argue with. Plus, it is <strong>surprisingly comfortable</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719845/therm-a-rest-trekker-pillowcase\">Therm-A-Rest Trekker Pillowcase</a> - Why take a pillow when you have plenty of soft things, like sweaters, along already? Well, these things tend to shift around at night, for one. But if you take a <strong>pillowcase</strong>, you can <strong>stuff all that soft stuff in and viola, you have a pillow</strong>. You could always just grab a pillowcase from home, but a <strong>microfleece</strong> pillowcase like the Trekker will feel that much better at night. And it <strong>weighs just 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>, which makes it a lightweight alternative to a full pillow.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - If nothing but a real pillow will do, this pillow from Therm-A-Rest is the best you will find. It <strong>compresses in to the pillowcase</strong> when not in use so you don't have to worry about it taking up room in your bag, and has that familiar, plush pillow feel to lull you to sleep. <strong>Weights vary from 7 ounces, or 198 grams, to 12 ounces, or 340 grams, depending on the size you choose</strong>, so your comfort does come at a bit of weight increase over the other two options.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Camping Pillows</h2>
As stated above, a pillowcase is a lightweight alternative to a pillow, provided you have a few clothing items to stuff in to the case at night. It might be a bit lumpy, but it will keep you comfortable.

Of course you can always just fold those same clothes up and make a pillow from the layers. Provided you have enough extra clothing this is a great option, and means that you don't have to carry any extra gear with you. It also means your clothes are toasty warm, though perhaps a bit drooled on, in the morning."

But hammocks keep you off the ground, integrate well with a tarp and offer you a cozy cocoon to curl up in.
<h2>Camping Hammock</h2>
Here are a few things to watch for when buying a camping hammock.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight -</strong> Depending on the material used, the stitching and the suspension system, the maximum weight capacity of camping hammocks will vary quite<!--more--> a bit. If you are a bigger person, you probably want to pay attention to the maximum weight, but for most people it will not be an issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Trees -</strong> This should go without saying, but camping hammocks are only really practical for camping in areas where there is a good amount of trees. It's not impossible to rig something up if there are no trees available, but it might not be worth all the extra work that would require.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Hammock</h2>
Some of the better camping hammocks around.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight</a> - If you want a ready-to-go camping hammock, the Explorer from Hennessy is a good option. You get a <strong>hammock, a rainfly and a suspension system</strong> so that you can start hammock camping right away. The whole system <strong>weighs 2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms, and is suitable for up to 250 pounds of weight</strong>. One stand out feature about the Explorer worth mentioning is that you are able to <strong>enter the hammock from the bottom</strong>, and then there are velco straps that close behind you, so no worries about tipping yourself out.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-singlenest-hammock\">Eagles Nest Outfitters SingleNest</a> - The SingleNest is a hammock, and does not include a hanging system or a rainfly, so if you already have those items or don't need them, this is a great option. What stands out about the SingleNest is that it <strong>accepts up to 400 pounds</strong>, so if you need the extra weight capacity, this is a good option. That extra weight capacity comes at a price, however, which is weight. The hammock <strong>weighs 18 ounces, or 510 grams</strong>, which will only increase when you start adding in tarps and riggings.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-travel-hammock\">Grand Trunk Ultra-Light</a> - The Ultra-Light from Grand Trunk is a definite lightweight option for hammock camping. At <strong>.75 pounds, or 340 grams</strong>, it's the lightest option on this list. You do only get a hammock, and not a tarp or a rigging system, however, so just beware of that when comparing it to other hammocks. The <strong>most impressive thing about this hammock, however, is the price</strong>. Prices will vary, depending on the retailer, but you can expect to pay as little as $20 for this hammock, which is a fantastic price.</li>

But when you are using a light source you often need both of your hands to work with whatever you are lighting, which is where something like an <strong>LED headlamp</strong> is so useful.
<h2>LED Headlamp</h2>
Best features to look for on an LED headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> If you are going to be carrying an LED headlamp around on your head, you might as well make it a light headlamp. And if you need a big and bright LED headlamp, at least get one with a good strap system so the headlamp isn't likely to fall off.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> It's best to get a headlamp with good battery life. You wont pay as much in replacement batteries, and you also wont have to haul replacement batteries around <!--more-->with you when you are camping or backpacking. Of course battery life is always going to be affected by the headlamp's lumens, or output.</li>
	<li><strong>Lumens -</strong> Always be aware of how much light you can expect from your headlamp. Most LED headlamps also typically have several different power settings, so that you can vary the amount of light you get, and also how long you can expect your battery to last.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best LED Headlamp</h2>
A few of the very best LED headlamps currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/745183/black-diamond-icon-headlamp\">Black Diamond Icon</a> - The Icon is a great headlamp if what you want is ample power. It puts out <strong>100 lumens</strong> on the high setting, and you get <strong>80 hours of battery life at that setting, or 140 hours on the low setting</strong>. But the Icon <strong>weighs 6.6 ounces, or 187 grams</strong>, so it's definitely not the lightest LED headlamp. But if you want high power, there is no getting around around a higher weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus</a> - The Tactikka is a great little headlamp with a bunch of good features. It <strong>weighs just 2.5 ounces, or 70 grams, and gives you 150 hours of running time on the lowest of the three brightness settings</strong>. One feature that a lot of people will appreciate is a <strong>small red filter that slides down over the white LEDs</strong>, to give the light a red tinge. Red LED light is desirable because it wont ruin your night vision, which can be handy when moving around at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ion-headlamp\">Black Diamond Ion</a> - The Ion is the lightest headlamp that Black Diamond makes. It <strong>weighs a scant 1.3 ounces, or 30 grams</strong>, which is light enough that you wont even know it's in your bag until you need it. The extremely small size, however, means that you <strong>get just 15 hours on the low setting, and 3 on high</strong>. Still, if you want lightweight, this is it.</li>

But these devices are also expensive, which is why it helps to read a few <strong>personal locator beacon reviews</strong> before you go and buy.
<h2>Personal Locator Beacon Features</h2>
Here are a few things you want to look for on a personal locator beacon.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> Ideally, the battery on your personal locator beacon will last long enough for rescuers to actually find you. A personal locator beacon with a poor battery life wont do you much good, and may provide you with a false sense of security when you find yourself in remote places.</li>
	<li><strong>Recurring Costs -</strong> Most personal locator beacons are free to use, but some do have a subscription service, and<!--more--> you should be aware of those costs up front.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> As with any electronic device, weight is probably a concern with a personal locator beacon, especially because you will often be carrying it, but hopefully never having to use it.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gps-satellite-messenger\">SPOT GPS Satellite Messenger</a> - The SPOT is a simple, lightweight device that works well as a personal locator beacon. You can <strong>send \"I'm OK\" messages to family and friends</strong> back home, and they can find out where you are with the associated GPS data. One advantage that this unit has is that it is <strong>cheaper than most other personal locator beacons</strong> on the market. This is offset, however, by the fact that <strong>you have to subscribe to SPOT's service</strong> if you want your help messages relayed to rescuers. So it's a trade-off. It <strong>weighs 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams, and the battery lasts for 1900 update messages, or 7 consecutive days in S.O.S. / 911 mode</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791972/mcmurdo-fast-find-210-personal-locator-beacon-with-gps\">McMurdo Fast Find 210</a> - The Fast Find is more of a traditional personal locator beacon. Upon being activated <strong>it sends a signal directly to a subscription free Search and Rescue satellite</strong>. Your unique personal locator beacon is identified, and Search and Rescue can then pull up your data, and your emergency contacts from that information. A <strong>homing signal is also transmitted for 24 hours</strong> to help rescuers find you, and there is a test mode to make sure everything is working okay.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/acr-sarlink-personal-locater-beacon\">ACR SARLink 406</a> - The 406 combines the best features of both the SPOT and the Fast Find. First, it gives you the <strong>option to send \"I'm OK\" updates</strong> to friends and family back home. It also allows you to <strong>send an emergency signal to the subscription free Search and Rescue satellite</strong>, and then <strong>emits a homing beacon</strong> to help ground rescuers actually find you. It also has a <strong>test mode</strong> to make sure that everything is functioning properly. <strong>At 8.9 ounces, or 252 grams</strong>, it's not exceptionally light, but it is an ideal personal locator beacon.</li>

But if you've never been before, or are just looking to spice things up a bit, then <strong>camping food ideas</strong> can help to put you on track for the kinds of things that you will want to pack with you when heading in to the outdoors.
<h2>Camping Food Ideas</h2>
Here are a few food ideas for your next camping trip.
<h3><strong>Breakfast</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Oatmeal -</strong> If you are willing to fire up the stove and get hot water going, then oatmeal is a great way to start the day when you are camping. Dried oats are lightweight, and provide you with plenty of energy. You can also throw in all kinds of things, like dried berries, that are also lightweight and will dramatically improve the flavor of the plain oatmeal. There are also plenty of <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695496/maryjanesfarm-organic-outrageous-outback-oatmeal\">premade oatmeal packets</a> ideal for camping.</li>
	<li><strong>Granola -</strong> If you just want something quick so that you can get going, granola is an ideal solution. It's high in energy, and goes well with something like powdered milk, which <!--more-->is also easy to pack along with you when you are camping or backpacking. You can even find <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/granola-w-blueberries-1-person\">premixed granola packages</a> that just need water.</li>
	<li><strong>Freeze Dried -</strong> There are also plenty of very tasty meals that can be cooked up from freeze dried packages. <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-house-scrambled-eggs-w-bacon-breakfast-entree\">Scrambled eggs and bacon</a>, for instance, can be easy as adding hot water.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Lunch</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trail Mix -</strong> I rarely find the time for a full cooked lunch when I'm camping and backpacking, and prefer something quick like trail mix. By utilizing variations such as <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818864/northwest-delights-pb-j-trail-mix-9-oz\">PB and J trail mix</a>, however, you can spice things up a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Assorted Snacks -</strong> Assorted snacks are another good way to get a quick lunch in. Things like <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804538/tanka-bar-buffalo-cranberry-jerky-bites\">jerky</a>, <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/clifbar-clif-bars-12-pack\">Clifbars</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/organic-bananas-1-person\">dried fruits</a> are ideal.</li>
	<li><strong>Freeze Dried -</strong> Of course if you want to stop and have something a little more proper, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/761630/seabear-smoked-salmon-35-oz\">freeze-dried smoked salmon</a> combined with a few crackers makes a great lunch, as does <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/alpineaire-creamy-potato-cheddar-soup\">soup</a> if you are willing to break out the stove for some hot water.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Dinner</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pastas -</strong> Pasta dinners are a staple of backpacking and camping. They're ideal because pasta lightweight when dry, filling when eaten and you only need one pot to make it. Cook your pasta, drain and mix well with any variety of sauces and you have a great meal.</li>
	<li><strong>Mix and Match -</strong> Something else I like to do when camping is to mix and match things. Combining spicy tomato soup mix with Mr. Noodles and a bit of pepperoni, for instance, is a great meal that can be made in one pot.</li>
	<li><strong>Freeze Dried -</strong> Of course there are many excellent freeze dried meals out there that will cut down on the time and effort needed to make dinner. <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/510134/mountain-house-beef-stroganoff-for-two\">Beef stroganoff</a> for two, for instance, makes a great meal, as does <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-house-pasta-primavera-1-serving-entree\">pasta primavera</a> or even <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/santa-fe-chicken-2-person\">Santa Fe chicken</a>. And don't forget about <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mocha-mousse-pie-2-person\">desert</a>.</li>

Whichever category you fall in to, a <strong>camping coffee maker</strong> can be a useful gadget to have along on the trail with you.
<h2>Camping Coffee Maker</h2>
Features to look for when looking for a camping coffee maker.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Easy to Clean -</strong> Cleaning is never any fun when you are camping, and the last thing you are going to want to have to do in the morning is put much effort in to cleaning out your coffee maker. So you should be trying to find a coffee maker that is as easy to clean as possible, so you can get to the important stuff with regards to camping.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated -</strong> It also helps if your camping coffee maker is integrated with other pieces of gear. A coffee pot, for<!--more--> instance, can easily double as a cooking pot for your meals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Maker</h2>
A few of the very best camping coffee makers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snow Peak Coffee Drip</a> - If you like a good cup of drip coffee in the morning, this coffee drip from Snow Peak is an elegant solution. It will <strong>sit on top of your cup and drip away</strong> while you tend to other things around camp. When you are done with it, the Snow Peak Coffee Drip <strong>folds down in to a neat little package</strong> for storage until the next time you use it. It <strong>weighs 4.9 ounces, or 138 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee and Tea Filter</a> - The MugMate is something a little different. It's designed more like a tea immersion device, but the <strong>150 micron metal filter</strong> would be ideal for making coffee in the same way. You just insert your coffee grinds in to the filter, immerse, and soon enough you have a good cup of coffee. And as the name suggests, it also <strong>easily doubles as a tea filter</strong>. It <strong>weighs just 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>, and <strong>won a Editor's Choice Gold Award in 2009 from Backpacker Magazine</strong>, so you know it's doing something right.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - If nothing but a <strong>french press</strong> will do even when you are camping, the Cafe Press is an ideal solution. It's a <strong>combination french press and pot</strong>, which will make you either <strong>one very large cup of coffee to start the morning or else two regular sized cups</strong>, to share with a fellow coffee drinker. It <strong>weighs 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>, but keep in mind that the pot will easily double as a cooking pot.</li>

You can use them for everything from a hot beverage to a scoop to a measuring device and even as a pot for heating up a bit of water. A camping cup is exactly the kind of versatile camping gear that you don't want to leave home without.
<h2>Camping Cups</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for camping cups.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There are a few different materials that you will be able to find camping cups in. The best is titanium. It weighs half as much as steel, doesn't corrode and takes a beating well. Stainless steel, aluminum and plastic are all options too.</li>
	<li><strong>Handle -</strong> A handle is a nice thing to have on a coffee cup, especially when you plan on making hot beverages. Just be sure that the handle folds back along the cup, or an already awkwardly <!--more-->shaped item will become even more difficult to get in to your backpack without any wasted space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Cups</h2>
A few of the very best camping cups.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">Snow Peak Titanium Double-Wall</a> - The Titanium Double-Wall is an <strong>ideal cup for beverages and a few other things</strong>. Since it is titanium it doesn't weigh much, at <strong>4.2 ounces, or 119 grams</strong>, but remember that it is double walled, which means double the material. It will <strong>hold 15.9 ounces, or .47 liters</strong>, which is a good amount for a cup of coffee or tea in the morning. The double wall feature means that the cup is well insulated, which will <strong>keep your beverage warm</strong>. The double walled construction, however, means that you should not cook with this cup.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/space-saver-cup\">Olicamp Space Saver</a> - The Space Saver is the perfect size to fit over the bottom of a nalgene bottle, or a similar bottle, which means you don't have to worry about finding a space saving spot in your bag for the cup. It's <strong>made form stainless steel, and while there's no weight listed for it</strong>, it's likely heavier than either of the titanium cups. It <strong>holds 16 ounces, or .47 liters</strong>, and has an <strong>extended handle</strong> which makes it a good option for heating water with.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-single-wall-cup-600\">Snow Peak Titanium Single Wall</a> - This cup from Snow Peak is the <strong>ideal camping cup</strong>.

It's a good thing to have on the trail, when you are hiking, backpacking or camping, and does equally well as a layer for staying warm around town. Soft shell jackets aren't well suited to all conditions, like rain, for instance, but they keep you warm and protected from the wind very well, and if you are a man that needs that role filled, <strong>soft shell jackets for men</strong> are worth looking at.
<h2>Soft Shell Jackets for Men</h2>
The features to look for when you are shopping for soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant -</strong> You probably wont find any soft shell jackets claiming to be waterproof, but there are many excellent soft shell jackets that can at least claim to be water resistant. In spring showers, for instance, when you don't want to stop to put on a jacket to keep a few drops off of you, a water resistant soft shell is ideal.</li>
	<li><strong>Fully Featured -</strong> For hikers, campers and backpackers, a soft shell jacket with a few extra features will be ideal. Many<!--more--> soft shell jackets come with things like zippered breast pockets and hoods that make them a more versatile piece of gear.</li>

The very best soft shell jackets for men.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/802439/marmot-gravity-jacket-mens\">Marmot Gravity Jacket</a> - The Gravity is a fairly basic soft shell jacket, that will keep you <strong>warm, breath well and shed light amounts of moisture</strong>. It has a <strong>full length zipper</strong>, which is a nice feature, and a <strong>draft flap</strong> to keep wind from coming through that zipper. It's an ideal soft shell jacket for wearing around town as well as in the outdoors.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-gamma-lt-softshell-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Gamma LT Softshell Jacket</a> - The Gamma LT is another soft shell jacket for men <strong>equally suited to the town and the backcountry</strong>. It has a <strong>full length zipper</strong> for easy on and off, as well as <strong>two upper chest zippered pockets</strong> for storing small but important accessories that you might want quick access to. It also has a <strong>DWR finish</strong>, so you know that it will shed water very well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/boreas-pull-on-men-s\">Rab Boreas Pull-On</a> - The Boreas won the <strong>2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's well suited for campers, backpackers and hikers.

And for women, <strong>women's hiking shorts</strong> are going to provide a much better fit, and higher level of comfort, than generic hiking shorts. Of course there are a few things that separate the good hiking shorts from the bad hiking shorts.
<h2>Women's Hiking Shorts</h2>
Features to look for when reviewing women's hiking shorts.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There are a couple of different fabrics that you will find hiking shorts made out of, but one of the most popular for hiking shorts and all kinds of other hiking clothing is nylon. It dries quickly, feels good against the skin and has a couple of other things going for it that make it ideal as a hiking clothing material.</li>
	<li><strong>DWR -</strong> DWR, which stands for Durable Water Repellent, is a treatment applied to some outdoor<!--more--> clothing to make it water resistant. If you think you might be getting a little wet while wearing hiking shorts, then you should definitely get a pair of hiking shorts with a DWR treatment.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women's Hiking Shorts</h2>
A few of the very best women's hiking shorts.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814516/rei-sahara-shorts-womens\">REI Sahara Shorts</a> - The Saharas by REI are a great all-around hiking short. They have a <strong>DWR finish</strong>, so they resist water well, and any water that does manage to get through will dry quickly, because of the <strong>nylon material</strong>. They're also <strong>knee length hiking shorts with a looser fit</strong>, one positive of which is that there is more room for pockets. The Saharas feature a total of <strong>6 pockets</strong> for storing whatever you need to carry. And finally, they have  a <strong>UPF 50+ rating</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-paramount-moraine-short-womens\">The North Face Paramount Moraine Shorts</a> - The Moraine shorts are a <strong>shorter, mid-thigh</strong> pair of hiking shorts. Despite that, North Face has still managed to find room for <strong>5 pockets</strong>, for carrying whatever needs to be carried. Beyond that, they're <strong>nylon and have a DWR finish</strong>, so you don't have to worry too much about water, and come with <strong>UPF 30+ protection</strong> from the sun.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/petra-shorts-women-s\">Mountain Hardwear Petra Shorts</a> - The Petra shorts are another <strong>longer and looser pair of hiking shorts</strong>. They're <strong>nylon with a DWR finish</strong>, and several <strong>large pockets and UPF 50+ protection</strong>, but what sets these hiking shorts apart is a conveniently placed chalk bag loop at the center rear of the waistband, so if rock climbing is something you like to do when you're not hiking, these shorts would work well there too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Women's Hiking Shorts</h2>
Of course if you want the most versatile clothing option possible, there is always a good pair of <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762387/mountain-hardwear-yuma-convertible-pants-womens\">convertible pants</a>. They're a pair of hiking shorts when you need them to be, and a pair of hiking pants for when things get a little chilly."

Even in the winter, sun reflecting off the bright snow can give you something called snow blindness, which leaves you, as the name suggests, temporarily bind. So whatever the season, it is a good idea to take along a pair of <strong>hiking snowshoes</strong> when you venture outside.
<h2>Hiking Sunglasses</h2>
The things to looks for when reviewing hiking sunglasses.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Polarized -</strong> For casual hiking polarization may not be all that useful, but if you find yourself hiking in the snow, for instance, or spending time on the water, it helps to have polarized lenses in your glasses to cut down on glare.</li>
	<li><strong>Strong Frame -</strong> Something else that it really pays to have on a pair of hiking sunglasses is a strong frame. If you like to venture off the beaten path, there is a chance your <!--more-->sunglasses will get a little beat up in the process, in which case you will want a pair that can take the beating without breaking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Sunglasses</h2>
A select few of the best hiking sunglasses around.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722629/chilis-bluefin-polarized-sunglasses\">Chili's Bluefin Polarized</a> - If you want something that is <strong>cheap and will get the job done</strong>, these are a great choice. You can usually <strong>find them for under $20</strong>, and they have a plain, basic style that makes them suitable for hiking and anywhere else you might want to take them. For $20 you are not going to be getting stellar lenses, but the polarization will definitely help.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/oakley-straight-jacket-sunglasses\">Oakley Straight Jacket</a> - These are a much higher end of basic sunglasses from Oakley. They <strong>do not come with polarized lenses, but you get Oakley's XYZ optics correction system</strong>, which gives you an excellent view. And the composite frames will handle a little wear and tear with ease.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/maui-jim-hookipa-sunglasses-polarized\">Maui Jim Ho'okipa</a> - If you want something a little more stylish, these are the hiking sunglasses for you. They are <strong>polarized</strong>, which can help when you are hiking in the snow, and the n<strong>ylon frames will hold up well to damage</strong>. And they look good enough to wear around town too, which is a definite plus.</li>

Features you want on camera bags for hiking.
<ul>

	<li><strong>Shock Proof -</strong> It also helps if your camera bag for hiking protects your camera from bumps and drops.</li>
	<li><strong>Easy Access -</strong> Your camera bag should<!--more--> also afford you quick and easy access to your camera while you are on the go. Nature wont stop and pose while you get your camera out, so you should be ready to capture at a moment's notice.</li>

A <strong>hiking GPS</strong> can do a lot of things for you in the outdoors, like record your route, help you follow a route, or even let friends and family know where you are and that you are okay.
<h2>Hiking GPS</h2>
Things you consider before buying a hiking GPS.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> As with any electronic device, weight can become a real issue. Depending on how much other gear you are carrying, and how long you are hiking for, weight can be more or less of an issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> Another concern with any electronic device is battery life. Getting a hiking GPS with a long battery life is always going to be better than getting one with a poor battery life. Carrying extra batteries, after all, is<!--more--> never going to be any fun.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hiking Watches</h2>
Features to look out for when shopping for hiking watches.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - Hiking watches should always be waterproof. This is a handy feature to have if you ever need to immerse your, while crossing a river, for instance, but even just rain and other, similar moisture can ruin a watch that isn't waterproof. Remember, it's a wet world outside.</li>
	<li><strong>____meter</strong> - Thermometers, barometers, altimeters, a good hiking watch usually has at least a few of these. They help you interpret the weather and can even give you a heads up <!--more-->on ugly weather moving in. Some, like the altimeter, can also give you some interesting data, and maybe even bragging rights, on things like your elevation.</li>
</ul>

It cooks your food, for one, but even if you don't cook anything, it can be nice to sit and absorb some of the warmth and enjoy the outdoors. Still, before you can get there, you need to get the fire started, and for that you need a <strong>fire starter for camping</strong>.
<h2>Fire Starter for Camping</h2>
Features to look for when you are looking for a fire starter for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weatherproof -</strong> Whatever kind of fire starter you decide upon, it should not be affected by a little bad weather. You don't want to have to go hungry, after all, just because it's a little windy out. Similarly, the a fire can be a great comfort when it's raining out, but only if you can get the fire started in the first place.</li>
	<li><strong>Reusable -</strong> Whatever fire starter method you choose to use for camping, it should also be reusable. Fires go out, the<!--more--> wind ruins everything, or something else happens. Make sure that you can start more than one fire with your fire starter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Fire Starter for Camping</h2>
A few of the very best fire starters for camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/e-gear-windmill-trekker-series-stormproof-lighter\">E-Gear Windmill Trekker Series Stormproof Lighter</a> - Flints and matches and everything else are never going to be as good as a lighter. And as far as lighters, go, the Windmill is a fantastic choice. It <strong>can light in 70 to 80 mph winds, will light over 1,000 times with just 4 grams of butane fuel, and gives off a 2,000 degree flame</strong>. If you absolutely must have a fire, there are few choices more dependable for starting it than the Windmill.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/strikeforce-fire-starter\">Ultimate Survival StrikeForce Fire Starter</a> - The StrikeForce is a great flint fire starter. The unique design with housing allows you to get a better strike on the flint than with a more traditional flint and steel combination. And the <strong>great thing about a flint system is that it works in a wide variety of conditions, and you get thousands of uses out of it</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762946/light-my-fire-swedish-firesteel-mini\">Light My Fire Swedish FireSteel Mini</a> - The FireSteel Mini is a more <strong>traditional magnesium and striker combination</strong>. Magnesium makes an excellent material for fire starters because the <strong>sparks it gives off are a toasty 5,500 degrees</strong>. And you can generate a <strong>spark about 1,500 times</strong>, so you really don't have to worry about getting it right the first time. It's also by far <strong>the cheapest choice on this list</strong>, so if you don't want to spend too much, it's a good choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fire Starter Accessories</h2>
So you have something to generate a flame or spark, but do you have anything to actually catch that spark? If you have a stove then you will already have your fuel source covered, but for those that like a good old fashioned wood fire, things are a bit more complicated. Kindling is ideal, but if you cant find any, or if things are wet, it can pay off to bring along a little fire starter.

Some people like to bring dryer lint to use as a fire starting material. It burns well, it's free, and it's something just about everyone can get their hands on. <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/619851/lightning-nugget-firestarters\">Fire starter nuggets</a> are also a good choice, as is <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/626906/coghlans-fire-paste\">fire paste</a>."

Anything can happen out there in the woods, but if you have a few things with you, you can dramatically improve your chances of survival. So if you want to be prepared for the worst when you go camping, pick up a few <strong>survival camping gear</strong> essentials.
<h2>Survival Camping Gear Kits</h2>
Pick up a survival camping gear kit to help keep you alive when things go wrong.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-pocket-survival-pak\">Adventure Medical Pocket Survival Pak</a> - With the Survival Pak you get everything that you need to <strong>start a fire, signal for help and repair your broken gear</strong>. General use items, like <strong>duct tape and nylon cord and a scalpel blade</strong> are useful for a wide variety of situations.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783989/lifeline-ultralight-survival-kit\">Lifeline Ultralight Survival Kit</a> - The Survival Kit is <strong>much the same as the Survival Pak</strong> above. The one real difference is that this kit provides you with <strong>wire for making a snare</strong>, which<!--more--> can be extremely useful, provided that you know how to make a snare. This kit is also quite a bit <strong>cheaper</strong> than the other one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Survival Camping Gear Basics</h2>
If you want just the absolute basics for survival camping gear, this is what you should bring.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-grylls-ultimate-survival-knife\">Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Knife</a> - The Bear grylls endorsement may or may not mean much to you, but regardless, the Survival Knife will at least help you survive. It's a knife, which is an item with any number of uses in a survival situation. It has a <strong>steel pommel</strong>, which can also be useful for a number of things. There is an <strong>emergency whistle</strong> attached to the handle for signaling for help, and a <strong>diamond sharpener and fire starter</strong> built in to the sheath. A useful little unit to have in a survival situation.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/745498/coghlans-six-function-whistle\">Coghlan's Six-Function Whistle</a> - This whistle is not just a whistle. It also comes with a <strong>compass, LED light, thermometer, signal mirror and magnifying lens</strong> for starting a fire with the power of the sun. The one thing that is missing is something sharp.</li>
</ul>

Of course there is no reason you cant put together your own camping survival kit from a few of the items listed above. Some more exotic items that you might consider including in your own camping survival kit include a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/1635/personal-locator-beacon-reviews/\">personal locator beacon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bottle-30-capsules\">diet supplement pills</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784611/adventure-medical-kits-suturesyringe-medic-kit\">suture kit</a>."

It's even better to go to bed not feeling sweaty and grimy from a long day on the trail. And one important part of keeping clean on the trail is having a <strong>backpacking towel</strong> along to dry off. Backpacking towels, incidentally, also make great pillows at night, provided they aren't wet.
<h2>Backpacking Towel</h2>
Things to look for when reviewing backpacking towels.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quick Drying -</strong> One of the best features of many backpacking towels is that they dry quickly. For some, just a few minutes in the sun can be enough to get them completely dry. So take advantage of this feature and get a backpacking towel that will dry out fast.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Enough -</strong> Backpacking towels also typically come in a wide variety of sizes. Depending on the material they are<!--more--> made out of, some of them can absorb quite a lot of water. And if they get full, you can always wring them out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Towel</h2>
A select few of the best backpacking towels.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-drylite-towel\">Sea to Summit DryLite Towel</a> - The DryLite towel from Australian manufacturer Sea to Summit makes an ideal backpacking towel. They're made from <strong>microfiber</strong>, so they dry extremely fast. The DryLite also comes in <strong>five different sizes and three different colors</strong>, so there really is something for everyone.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packtowl-personal\">MSR Packtowl Personal</a> - The Packtowl is a <strong>combination of microfiber and polyester</strong>, so again, it is extremely fast drying. It comes in <strong>four different sizes and three different colors</strong>, so you also get quite a bit of choice with this backpacking towel.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783079/rei-multitowel-lite-large-towel-37-x-235\">REI MultiTowel Lite</a> - The MultiTowel from REI is a <strong>combination of microfiber and polyester</strong>, much like the Packtowl from MSR. Besides large, it also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783078/rei-multitowel-lite-medium-towel-255-x-155\">medium</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783080/rei-multitowel-lite-x-large-towel-49-x-295\">extra large</a> size.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backcountry Bathing Accessories</h2>
A backpacking towel isn't of much use if you don't have a few other things to go along with it. Optional, but definitely recommended is a good <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/camping-soap/\">camping soap</a>. Even just a dousing in water will do wonders for most sweaty backpackers, but soap will get you a lot closer to clean.

But even before you apply the camping soap, you will need some way to get the water to you. A warm creek or river is ideal, but just in case you aren't so lucky, a lightweight <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-pocket-shower\">pocket shower</a> is a great way to give yourself a good cleaning when you're in the middle of nowhere. It's lightweight enough that you will hardly even notice it in your backpack, and it will hang from just about anywhere strong enough to support the weight of the water. Best of all, it's black, so you can leave it to sit in the sun for a bit while you set up camp, and while the water wont be warm, it wont be frigid cold either."

But snowshoes are also very size specific, and adult snowshoes will likely be too much snowshoe for most kids to handle. For such situations, there are some excellent <strong>kids snowshoes</strong> available, that are appropriate to the size of the average child.
<h2>Kids Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for one kids snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> The lighter kids snowshoes are, the more fun those kids will have. Dragging around heavy snowshoes is a lot of work, after all, and this is doubly true for kids. So do your kids a favor, and ultimately yourself a favor, and get a pair of kids snowshoes that don't weigh too much.</li>
	<li><strong>Easy Bindings -</strong> The bindings on kids snowshoes should be easy enough for any kid to figure out. Similarly, the bindings should fit a wide range of feet, so that are your kids age <!--more-->and their feet grow, you don't have to keep buying new pairs of snowshoes for them.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Kids Snowshoes</h2>

The <strong>recommended weight load for these snowshoes is 40 to 90 pounds, and they weigh 2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/776452/msr-denali-tyker-snowshoes-kids\">MSR Denali Tyker Snowshoes</a> - The Tyker snowshoes are another snowshoe ideal for kids. They fit <strong>children's shoe sizes 7.5 to 13.5</strong>, and have a <strong>recommended maximum weight load of 80 pounds</strong>.

The tab binding style is meant to be easy to use, even in the cold with mitten on. The <strong>Tykers weigh 1.9 pounds, or 878 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/storm-kids-snowshoes\">Tubbs Storm Kids Snowshoes</a> - The Storm snowshoes from Tubbs are <strong>more of a traditional snowshoe in a kids size</strong>.

And while a good pair of waterproof hiking boots can go a long ways towards protecting your feet from moisture, they are powerless to stop rain, snow and any other moisture source from coming in over the tops of your boots. For that, you need <strong>hiking gaiters</strong>.
<h2>Gaiters - Hiking</h2>
Features to look for from hiking gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Length -</strong> The length that you want will vary, depending on what you are doing in your gaiters, but just know that there several lengths and styles available. There are short, ankle gaiters and bigger, knee high gaiters that cover a significant portion of the top of your boot as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> Water isn't the only thing that might find its way in to your boots. But for hiking, water is probably going to be your main concern, so you should be looking for gaiters that <!--more-->are waterproof, or at least water resistant, to keep the water out of your boots or shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gaiters - Hiking</h2>
A few of the very best hiking gaiters you will find on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769568/mountain-hardwear-nut-shell-high-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Nut Shell High Gaiters</a> - The Nut Shell gaiters are a lighter, more breathable gaiter for situations like bush whacking in brush, where a lot of water can find it's way in to your boots. They're made from a polyurethane coated nylon, which is <strong>water resistant</strong>, but not waterproof. Still, they are <strong>15 inches high</strong>, and the <strong>cord on the bottom of them is replaceable</strong>, so if it ever wears out from being walked on you can always just get a new one.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiter</a> - These are big and burly hiking gaiters ideal for a wide variety of conditions. The <strong>leg section of the gaiters is Gore-Tex</strong>, so you get waterproof with some amount of breathability as well. The <strong>boot section of the gaiters is water resistant nylon</strong> which will stand up better to the abuse, such as boot rubbing, that this section typically endures. These are the kind of gaiters that can be used and abused and still protect your boots. They also come in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flex-tex-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Flex-Tex Gaiters</a> - The Flex-Tex gaiters are a good example of the <strong>shorter, ankle gaiters</strong>. The shorter size means they aren't as suited to keep water out of your boots as higher gaiters, though they will keep out light snow and rain. What they are <strong>ideally suited for is keeping rocks, dust and other debris out of your boots</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking in Snake Country</h2>
Those hiking in snake country might also want a pair of gaiters, though not for the purposes of protecting boots from moisture and debris. Some of the gaiters above will be better than nothing when it comes to snake bits, but you might still end up getting bit.

If you want to give your feet a little breathing room for your summer hiking, hiking sandals are the answer. Of course just like any other footwear, there are some important differences that <strong>hiking sandals for women</strong> have over sandals for men.
<h2>Hiking Sandals for Women</h2>
Regardless of what your gender is, hiking sandals should have a few things going for them.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Secure -</strong> These aren't flip-flops, they're hiking sandals. Just like hiking shoes, hiking sandals should stay on your feet and provide you with a solid base. Uneven trail surfaces are a fact of life when hiking, and you don't want your hiking sandals shifting around everywhere, making every step difficult.</li>
	<li><strong>Good Sole -</strong> Hiking sandals should also have a good, solid sole so that you can depend on them to keep you on your feet. You might not be able to find hiking sandals with the same<!--more--> grip and sole that you would find on a hiking shoe, but there should be more than a flat surface on the bottom of your hiking sandals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Sandals for Women</h2>
Some of the very best hiking sandals for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-newport-h2-sandal-womens\">KEEN Newport H2 Sandal</a> - The Newport H2s are more like a shoe with a bunch of material taken out, rather than an overbuilt sandal. The <strong>fully featured sole provides plenty of grip</strong>, and the upper webbing is enough like a shoe that you wont be slipping out of them. A <strong>single pull bungee with a toggle clip tightens</strong> and loosens the Newport H2s, making them easy to get on and off.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798168/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-womens\">Vibram FiveFingers Sprint Multisport</a> - These are not, technically, a sandal, but they're definitely not a shoe either. The very unique design, with a spot for each toe, means that you have <strong>excellent control and stability on a wide variety of terrain</strong>. And because they fit like a glove, you can be sure they're never going to slip off while hiking. And just like a hiking sandal, the FiveFingers are <strong>capable of drying quickly</strong>, making them well suited to hiking in and around water.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/chaco-z-2-unaweep-sandal-womens-cha0040\">Chaco Z/2 Unaweep Sandal</a> - The Unaweep are more a really well built sandal that are ideal for hiking. The Unaweeps are s<strong>ecured to your feet with a number of overlapping bands</strong>, and a <strong>single pull buckle</strong> is enough to keep them from ever falling off. If you are looking for something more like a <strong>traditional sandal</strong> for hiking in, these are a a great choice.</li>

Whether you are hiking, backpacking, camping or even just walking around town, goose down is an ideal material to keep you warm. It has a remarkable warmth to weight ratio, so you don't need a lot to keep you warm, and it also packs down extremely small, which is always a nice feature if you are taking your goose down jacket in to the outdoors.
<h2>Goose Down Jacket</h2>
Features to look for when you are looking for a goose down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> The one big caveat when it comes to down is that it does not perform well when wet. It will keep you toasty warm when dry, but if you get it wet it wont do much. So if you plan to be taking your goose down jacket in to a situation where you will need it to be warm, and where there is a possibility of getting wet, you should either have a waterproof down jacket or a waterproof layer that you can put over your non-waterproof down jacket.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality -</strong> Not all goose down is created equal. The more loft goose down provides, the warmer it is, and the<!--more--> better it is. When you are looking at goose down jackets, the number you want to pay attention to for down quality is the fill power. The higher the fill power, the more warmth you get for the same amount of weight. Anything in the 800 to 900 range is very good, though 700 and up is not too shabby either.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/770806/patagonia-down-sweater-mens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - The Down Sweater from Patagonia is a great down jacket for a variety of uses. First, it comes with <strong>800-fill goose down</strong>, which provides an excellent weight to warmth ratio. It has a <strong>polyester exterior, so it's not waterproof</strong>. It also doesn't come with a hood, and is hip length, or a 25 inch back length to be more exact. It <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - Canada Goose makes goose down jackets for cold conditions. It's been the <strong>official jacket of the  National Science Foundation at Antarctica's McMurdo Station research facility for over 20 years</strong>. The exterior is <strong>water resistant</strong>, and it comes with a fur-lined hood, as well as a snow skirt to protect you from the elements. Despite the Canada Goose brand name, this jacket is actually made with <strong>duck down</strong>, which is an ideal material for the extremely cold temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Goose Down Jackets for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-women-s\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> - The Alpine Light is the <strong>2011 winner of the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award</strong>. It uses <strong>800-fill down</strong> and a nylon exterior, so while it's not waterproof it does provide an excellent amount of warmth to weight. Speaking of weight, the Alpine Light <strong>weighs 12.7 ounces, or 360 grams</strong>. It also comes with a hood and high collar for keeping you warm in bad weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-montebello-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Montebello Down Parka</a> - The Montbello is the best when temperatures dip down low. It's <strong>water resistant</strong>, so you don't have to worry as much about getting wet, and despite the Canada Goose brand name, the Montbello actually uses <strong>duck down</strong> in place of goose down. There is also a down filled hood with coyote fir trim, though the fir is removable too. If you need something that will perform in the cold and the snow, Canada Goose is an ideal jacket manufacturer.</li>

There are, of course, some differences between <strong>fleece jackets for women</strong> and for men.
<h2>Fleece Jackets for Women</h2>
Features to look for on a fleece jacket, regardless of the gender.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness -</strong> Different fleece jackets are different thicknesses, and the thickness of your fleece jacket will determine how warm the fleece jacket is. The thickness will also help in determining how wind proof the jacket is.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets and Hoods -</strong> For walking around town you may not be too worried about the different features that your fleece jacket does or does not have, but when you start hiking, backpacking or camping with a fleece jacket, there are a few things that you will likely want. Pockets, for one, to give you easy access to important gear. Another feature outdoor adventurers might want is a hood, to<!--more--> provide extra warmth when the temperature drops and the wind picks up.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey</a> - The Monkey is a slightly different kind of fleece jacket. It features a very unique kind of fabric, officially called <strong>Monkey Phur</strong>, that has lofted curls on the outside to provide <strong>extra warmth and protection from the wind</strong>. The inside, however, is smooth, to give it a nice feel against your skin.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-khumbu-fleece-jacket-womens\">The North Face Khumbu</a> - The Khumbu is a basic, yet versatile fleece jacket for women.

When you are in the outdoors, getting wet can be rather uncomfortable, and can ruin an otherwise fun trip. And even around town, no one likes to get wet if they don't have to. Of course there are a few important differences between<strong> rain jackets for women</strong> and rain jackets for men.
<h2>Rain Jackets for Women</h2>
A few features to look out for when reviewing rain jackets for women.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> It should go without saying, but any rain jacket you get should be waterproof. You might be tempted to get a water resistant jacket instead, if the price is right and the reviews are good, but a waterproof jacket is always going to protect you far better from rain than a water resistant jacket will.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation -</strong> Waterproof jackets are great at keeping water out, but often not so great at letting sweat out. Which is why it's usually important to go with a rain jacket that has good ventilation. Pit zips, which are zippers under the arm pits, are a great <!--more-->place to have ample ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rain Jackets for Women</h2>
A few of the very best rain jackets for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803344/arcteryx-theta-ar-jacket-womens\">Arc'Teryx Theta AR Jacket</a> - The Theta AR is one of the better waterproof jackets you will find on the market. <strong>Gore-Tex 3L Pro</strong> fabric means you are completely protected from rain and wind, and not just for a limited amount of time, which is often the case with cheaper materials. <strong>Pit zips</strong> provide ample ventilation, and the <strong>high collar combined with a drop hood</strong> means you don't have to worry about your head getting wet. Small touches like <strong>articulated elbows and an extra long torso</strong> mean that even when you're moving around, you're not going to be getting wet. If you want the best, this is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-venture-jacket-womens\">The North Face Venture Jacket</a> - The Venture is a great choice if you're not looking to spend a lot. The <strong>HyVent DT fabric is lightweight and waterproof</strong>, and also very breathable. <strong>Pit zips</strong> ensure that you will always stay well ventilated, even when you're working hard. But again, the stand out feature with the Venture is the price, which is <strong>typically around $100</strong>, which is quite low for a fully functional rain jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/precip-jacket-women-s\">Marmot Precip Jacket</a> - The Precip is another <strong>value-oriented rain jacket</strong> that will do well in rainy conditions. It is made of <strong>ripstop nylon, which is waterproof up to a point, and fairly breathable</strong>. The Precip also provides you with <strong>pit zips</strong> so that you never have to worry much about ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Rain Jackets</h2>
If you're backpacking, hiking or camping, and don't care about what you look like, so much as you care about staying dry, there is an excellent alternative to rain jackets, and that is a poncho.

There are some very cheap and very effective <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/744947/outdoor-products-multi-purpose-poncho-womens\">ponchos</a> that ventilate well and even give you enough room to wear a backpack underneath. There are also some more <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">innovative ponchos</a> that will both protect you and your backpack from the elements, and double as a tarp shelter to sleep under.

Again, not the best option for around town, but an inexpensive and effective option for keeping you dry in the outdoors."

Many dry fast, give you plenty of pocket room for gadgets and important stuff, and even convert in to shorts if things get too hot. And there's plenty more that a good pair of hiking pants will do too. Of course, <strong>hiking pants for men</strong> and women are two different things, and these are hiking pants for men.
<h2>Hiking Pants for Men</h2>
A few things to look for when shopping for hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quick Drying -</strong> Sometimes when you're outside, you get wet. It happens. Fortunately, many hiking pants are able to dry extremely quickly, from just your body heat or a little time in the sun. Many of these quick drying hiking pants are made from nylon, so be on the lookout for nylon hiking pants.</li>
	<li><strong>Convertible -</strong> Convertible hiking pants are the ones that zip off at the knee to become shorts. You may or <!--more-->may not be a fan of this feature, but you definitely cannot deny that it increases the versatility of the hiking pants tremendously.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Pants for Men</h2>
The very best hiking pants for men.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784059/rei-adventures-pants-mens-30-inseam\">REI Adventures Pants</a> - The Adventures pants from REI are an ideal pair of hiking pants for men looking for a <strong>non-convertible</strong> pair of hiking pants. They don't convert, but what they do do is <strong>dry quickly, being made from nylon</strong>. They also have <strong>plenty of zippered pockets</strong> for storing essential gear while out on the trail, and are also <strong>UPF 50+</strong> to protect you from too much sun. Finally, they come in a couple of different colors so you have a little variety of choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/cruz-convertible-pant-men-s\">Marmot Cruz Convertible Pants</a> - The Cruz hiking pants are a great pair of feature rich hiking pants. First, they are made from <strong>abrasion resistant nylon</strong>, which resists tears and rips well, and also dries extremely quickly. They also have a <strong>DWR finish</strong>, so most moisture will just wick right off, making fast drying redundant for all but the worst weather. They are also <strong>convertible</strong>, as the name suggest, so you get a pair of shorts and pants, all in one package. And lastly they have a <strong>UPF 50+ rating</strong>, for those times when you are out in the sun.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-paramount-peak-convertible-pant-mens\">The North Face Paramount Peak Convertible Pant</a> - Another excellent pair of convertible pants, this time from The North Face. These pants come with a <strong>DWR finish, on top of the nylon fabric</strong>, so any water that makes it past the DWR finish will dry quickly, either from body heat or sun exposure once the rain passes. The Paramount Peak pants also come with a <strong>semi-elastic waist</strong>, for a good fit every time, a <strong>total of 7 pockets, and UPF 30+ rating</strong>.</li>

<h2>Hiking Jackets</h2>
Features that you should look for from a hiking jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant -</strong> When reviewing soft shell jackets, it's best to find something that is water resistant, at the very least. You will need a proper rain jacket for any serious downpours, but for everything else, water resistant is ideal, which is part of what makes soft shell jackets ideal hiking jackets.</li>
	<li><strong>Warmth -</strong> It's also a good idea to look at hiking jackets with a good amount of warmth. Most jackets can be unzipped, to cool off, but when you stop to take in the view, or to eat lunch, being able to eek out a few more degrees of warmth is <!--more-->important. Related to this, it's always good to get a breathable jacket, which is something that soft shell jackets also do well.</li>

Features to keep an eye out for when reviewing hiking shirts.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathable -</strong> Hiking shirts should be breathable. Just about everyone sweats here and there when hiking, after all, and it's best if that sweat is allowed to dissipate, rather than collect on your hiking shirt.</li>
	<li><strong>Quick Drying -</strong> And if your sweat does collect on your hiking shirt, or if you get caught in a little bit of rain, it helps if your hiking shirt can dry quickly. Whether it's body heat or <!--more-->the sun, a good hiking shirt will dry quickly from any moisture that collects.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Best Men's Shirts</strong></h3>
<ul>

It's actually made from <strong>merino wool</strong>, but not the thick, scratchy kind. Wool is actually an ideal material for hiking shirts, because it <strong>breathes extremely well, and wicks moisture extremely well</strong>. The finer, high quality wool also feels great against the skin. <strong>Wool also does not retain nearly as much odor as something like nylon or cotton</strong>, which is another big plus for a hiking shirt.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Women's Shirts</strong></h3>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808593/rei-venturi-quarter-zip-shirt-womens\">REI Venturi Quarter-Zip Shirt</a> - The Venturi is a stylish hiking shirt equally suited to both the trail and the town.

A <strong>deep front zipper and underarm ventilation</strong> help regulate temperature, and an upper arm, zippered pocket gives you somewhere to store a few small essentials. Finally, <strong>UPF +50 protection</strong> makes it ideal for sunny weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/icebreaker-superfine-150-tech-t-shirt-lite-short-sleeve-womens\">Icebreaker SuperFine 150 Tech Lite T-Shirt</a> - A very similar hiking shirt to the Icebreaker shirt in the men's hiking shirts section. It's made of <strong>wool, but not the scratchy sweater kind</strong>. This is high quality, extremely fine wool. Wool both <strong>breathes and insulates well, and wicks moisture away</strong> from the skin quickly, without retaining much or any of it. You also have a <strong>few different colors to choose from</strong>, which is another nice touch.</li>

Wool is an ideal fabric for socks for a couple of reasons. First, it wicks moisture well, which is always an important feature to have in a sweaty, enclosed space. It also insulates in cold temperatures and breathes well when it's warm out. And best of all, wool is much more resistant to odors than other fabrics like cotton.
<h2>Wool Hiking Socks</h2>
All the best features of wool hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> There are a wide variety of wool sock weights available, ranging from thin and light all the way up to thick and heavy. What you use will depend in large part on what weather conditions you plan to go hiking in, but for most spring, summer and fall hiking, light hiking socks provide ample warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Form Fitting -</strong> Leave the tube socks at home, and pick up a pair of fitted hiking socks instead. Hiking socks that conform to your feet will prevent blisters, and allow you to utilize features of these higher end socks, like strategic<!--more--> venting, to improve the performance you get form your hiking socks.</li>

The entire line comes with <strong>SmartWools 4 point stretch system, which gives support to the arch, ankle and instep</strong>. Thin, stretch mesh along the top of the toe <strong>maximizes breathability</strong>, while double layered wool under the heel and toes helps <strong>cushion your step</strong>.

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-evapor8-light-low-running-sock-womens\">Teko Merino Light Low Sock</a> - This sock from Teko has a low profile <strong>ideally suited to a low cut hiking shoe</strong>.

And hiking underwear can do more than just keep you feeling comfortable. Innovative techniques and fabrics can, for example, keep you odor free as well, which can come in handy on extended camping or backpacking trips where taking along a fresh pair for every day isn't really an option.
<h2>Hiking Underwear</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing hiking underwear.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fabric -</strong> The fabric that you choose is important when you are picking out hiking underwear. You have a few different choices, but the two big ones are the nylon and spandex blends, or similar materials, and wool. Each have their own positives and negatives.</li>
	<li><strong>Tight Fit -</strong> This one is directed more at men, but generally, loose boxer briefs are a bad idea that can lead to chaffing. It's best to go with a tight fit, which will cut down on any chaffing <!--more-->and give you a much more comfortable hiking experience.</li>

<h3><strong>Best Hiking Underwear for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/694431/exofficio-give-n-go-boxer-briefs-mens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs</a> - The Give-N-Gos are an extremely popular pair of hiking underwear that could be used for camping, backpacking or just about any other active pursuit. They're a <strong>blend of nylon and spandex, which makes for a very comfortable, quick drying fit</strong>. One thing that stands out about them, however, is an <strong>anti-microbial treatment</strong>, which keeps odors from building up, making one pair a viable option for multi-day outings.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/boxer-brief-w-fly-150-men-s\">Icebreaker Boxer Briefs</a> - The design of these boxer briefs from Icebreaker is much the same as the ExOfficios. The one big difference is the material, which is wool for Icebreaker. <strong>Wool controls temperature well, wicks moisture and feels good against the skin when it's the high quality stuff</strong>. Wool also <strong>does not absorb odors</strong> much at all, so you get the same features, but with a more natural fabric. These do cost roughly double what the ExOfficios cost, however.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Hiking Underwear for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795155/exofficio-give-n-go-string-bikini-briefs-womens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go String Bikini Briefs</a> - These Bikini Briefs from ExOfficio are much the same as the men's hiking underwear above, but with a women's cut. They're a <strong>nylon and spandex combination</strong>, so they will both dry very well and wick moisture away from the skin in a timely manner. They also have an <strong>anti-microbial treatment</strong> to keep you smelling fresh, even on multi-day outdoor adventures.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-merino-boy-boxer-womens\">Stoic Merino Boy Boxer</a> - If you would prefer your hiking underwear to have more of a boxer cut, this hiking underwear from Stoic is ideal. They're <strong>merino wool</strong>, so they regulate body heat very well, and wick moisture as well. Wool also <strong>resists odors much better than most other fabrics</strong>, natural or synthetic, which can be a nice touch on multi-day trips when bringing multiple pairs isn't always practical.</li>

<h2>Hiking Compass</h2>
A few things to look for when you are looking for a hiking compass.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sighting Mirror -</strong> If you're checking your bearing a lot and need to make a quick, accurate assessment of your direction of travel, a sighting mirror is a lot of help in doing that. It allows you to quickly line up the compass face and the terrain in the distance, and keep moving.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjustable Housing -</strong> If you are using a compass on a regular basis then an adjustable housing will save you a lot of time, and will help to make sure that you are headed in the<!--more--> right direction. What it really does is save you from having to do the mental math every time you look at the compass, because that extra step can lead to mistakes, which can lead to you getting lost.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Compass</h2>
A few of the very best hiking compasses that will be sure to get you to where you need to be.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787189/suunto-mc-2-pro-compass\">Suunto MC-2 Pro</a> - The MC-2 Pro is an ideal mid range compass that has everything you need to find your way through the woods. A <strong>sighting mirror</strong> makes navigation quick and easy, and the mirror folds down to protect the compass when not in use. The <strong>declination is adjustable</strong>, so you don't have to do any mental math adjusting between true north and magnetic north. An <strong>adjustable lanyard</strong> and a <strong>weight of 2.65 ounces, or 75 grams</strong> rounds out the feature set of the MC-2 Pro.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-8099-pro-compass\">Brunton 8099 Pro</a> - The 8099 Pro is for serious navigation. It includes all the standard features, like a <strong>sighting mirror and adjustable declination</strong>. It also includes a few more advanced features, like a <strong>bubble level and an advanced clinometer system</strong> for measuring slope angles, which is ideal for traversing snowy slopes and other such obstacles. The <strong>weight is 3.6 ounces, or 102 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tag-a-long-w-thermometer\">Brunton Tag-a-Long</a> - If all you want is something that you can <strong>throw in your bag and take out if you get lost and need a general direction for civilization</strong>, the Tag-a-Long is a good choice. It doesn't include a sighting mirror or adjustable housing, it's <strong>just a needle and bearings</strong>, which is all you need. It also <strong>includes a thermometer</strong>, which can come in handy, and is on a key ring so that you can attach it to a buckle or strap. Best of all, it <strong>weighs a mere .7 ounces, or 20 grams</strong>, so you wont even know it's there until you need it.</li>

There are a lot of different designs and materials that you can find hiking gloves in, but at a minimum they should keep your hands warm while still offering you a good amount of dexterity. Some hiking gloves you find will be gender specific, but there are many that can be used by just about anybody.
<h2>Hiking Gloves</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for hiking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> You may or may not have a preference for the kind of gloves that you want, but just know that there are a few different fabrics out there that you will find gloves in. Fleece, for instance, is a common fabric, as is wool. If you've ever had sweaters or other, similar garments made out of these materials then you probably have a preference for one or another.</li>
	<li><strong>Windstopper -</strong> Some gloves have a fabric called Windstopper integrated in to the gloves. This fabric can add a few degrees of warmth to particularly thin gloves and will, as the name suggests, prevent your gloves from letting out too much<!--more--> warmth when the wind picks up. For thicker hiking gloves, however, Windstopper isn't as much of a concern.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Gloves</h2>
A few of the very best best hiking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/801124/smartwool-cozy-gloves\">SmartWool Cozy Gloves</a> - As the brand name suggests, these are <strong>wool gloves, but they are blended with nylon and elastic</strong> to help improve the wool's ability to breath well and wick away moisture. They come in fairly <strong>neutral colors, which makes them ideal for either men or women</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/icebreaker-glove-320\">Icebreaker Glove 320</a> - Another <strong>basic wool glove</strong>, this time from Icebreaker. As with anything made of wool, these will regulate the temperature of your hands well and wick away moisture too. They <strong>come in a standard black, and a few different sizes</strong>, which makes them a unisex option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-mens\">Outdoor Research Gripper Glove</a> - These are definitely something a little warmer. They're a bit bulkier than the other two options listed, and are <strong>fleece</strong>, instead of wool. They also have<strong> Windstopper fabric sewn in to them</strong>, which will eliminate wind chill and add a few additional degrees of warmth. Definitely a good option for winter hiking, snowshoeing and similar activities. They also come in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>

Despite the fact that so few people think to bring umbrellas hiking, they serve a few purposes quite elegantly. First, a <strong>hiking umbrella</strong> protects you from the rain, and best of all, it wont get you all sweaty either. A hiking umbrella can also protect you from the sun. And they're small and light enough to slip in to a pocket when not in use.
<h2>Hiking Umbrella</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hiking umbrellas.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Strong and Light -</strong> If you're gong to replace or supplement your rain gear with an umbrella then you would hope that the umbrella at least weighs less than the rain gear does. At the same time, you don't want your umbrella collapsing under the first gust of wind. Ideally, you want something that is strong, but not by adding on a lot of weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Enough Diameter -</strong> Hiking umbrellas are typically made for just one person to walk under, and are usually fairly small. You want the hiking umbrella to be big enough to <!--more-->cover you and your pack if you're wearing one, but anything beyond that is going to just be wasted space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Umbrella</h2>
There aren't many hiking umbrellas on the market, but these are the best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/792725/rei-flyweight-siliconized-nylon-manual-umbrella\">REI Flyweight Siliconized Nylon Manual Umbrella</a> - As the name suggests, this the Flyweight uses siliconized nylon, a lightweight material sometimes used for tents, to protect you from the sun and rain. It gives you <strong>3 feet of diameter</strong> when fully open, but packs down very small. <strong>One nice touch is a small carabiner clip on the side of the bag</strong>, for easy carrying when not in use. The <strong>shaft is steel, while the ribs are fiberglass, and all told it weighs 7.1 ounces, or 201 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-trekking-umbrella\">Mont Bell U.L. Trekking Umbrella</a> - This hiking umbrella from Mont Bell is <strong>small and lightweight</strong>, perfect for those looking to save on weight. It uses nylon for the canopy, and aluminum for the ribs. The <strong>canopy is only 32 inches when fully open</strong>, but that's still plenty for hiking under, and it <strong>weighs just 5.8 ounces, or 164 grams</strong>, so it's a great small and light option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-dome-trekking-umbrella\">GoLite Dome Trekking Umbrella</a> - This hiking umbrella from ultralight manufacturer GoLite is actually the heaviest hiking umbrella on the list, at <strong>11 ounces, or 312 grams. But it's also the biggest, with a 45 inch canopy diameter when open</strong>, so you at least get plenty of umbrella for the extra weight. One more thing that stands out about the Dome is the <strong>lifetime warranty from GoLite</strong>, which you certainly wont find on too many umbrellas, which have a habit of breaking quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When Hiking Umbrellas Fail</h2>
Umbrellas are ideal in some situations, but in others they will have a habit of failing. When the wind picks up, for instance, your umbrella will be in danger of getting broken, and if the rain is coming at you at a steep enough angle, your hiking umbrella wont be worth much anyway. Similarly, on a trail where a lot of vegetation is growing overhead, in a rain forest, for instance, you might have to spend just as much time looking at your umbrella, trying to avoid trees, as you do looking at your feet, trying to avoid roots.

The point is, be aware of what conditions you are heading in to before you take a hiking umbrella with you. There are situations where traditional rain gear will be a better fit."

They come in handy with everything from making meals, to emergency gear repair, and even a little first aid if someone has an accident. At the same time a <strong>backpacking knife</strong> is a big hunk of metal, and they can get heavy quickly, which is why it's important to do your shopping carefully when reviewing backpacking knives.
<h2>Backpacking Knife</h2>
Features that you should be looking for from a backpacking knife.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Serrated -</strong> You never know what you're going to need a backpacking knife for, so it helps to have a few options available to you. Having a knife where a section of the blade is serrated gives you a lot of options for cutting through rope and a whole lot of other things.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> When you're backpacking, every ounce counts, and a big hunk of metal can get really heavy really quickly. For that reason, it's best to try and get a backpacking knife that is<!--more--> light enough that you're not going to regret bringing it every time you go backpacking.</li>
	<li><strong>Folding or Fixed -</strong> Folding knives are smaller and usually lighter, but also not as strong. You don't want to be putting too much sideways pressure on that joint. A fixed blade is one solid piece of metal, so it's stronger, but they're also typically bigger and heavier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Knife</h2>
The very best backpacking knives.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-paraframe-i-serrated-edge-knife\">Gerber Paraframe I Serrated Edge Knife</a> - The Paraframe is an ideal, all around backpacking knife. It's a <strong>folding knife</strong>, with a handy belt clip for easy access. A portion of the blade is also <strong>serrated</strong>, so you have a few different cutting options available to you. The blade is only <strong>3 inches long, and it weighs 2.6 ounces, or 73 grams</strong>, so it's not especially big, but then backpacking knives don't need to be.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peck-in-the-dark\">Columbia River Peck in the Dark</a> - The Peck in the Dark is what you take if you want something sharp just in case. It's a <strong>folding knife, and weighs a mere .9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>. Being that lightweight, you only get a <strong>1.88 inch long blade</strong>, but it will cut just as well as a bigger knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Gerber Big Rock Serrated Knife</a> - The Big Rock is a great all around <strong>fixed length backpacking knife</strong>. A portion of the blade is <strong>serrated</strong>, and the <strong>blade is 4.5 inches long</strong>. It's big and solid, and weighs in at <strong>6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>. So it's not nearly as lightweight as the other two, but it's a lot tougher and stronger, and if you want a fixed length backpacking knife it's a good choice.</li>

Once you have your fire going, you are going to need a pot, pan or combination of the two to get your meal heated and ready for eating. For the best results, you need <strong>camping pots and pans</strong>.
<h2>Camping Pots and Pans</h2>
Features to look for on camping pots and pans.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There are several different materials that you will typically find camping pots and pans coming in. The three big ones are stainless steel, aluminum and titanium. Stainless steel is strong, aluminum is fairly light and titanium is both strong and light, though more expensive.</li>
	<li><strong>Combo Unit -</strong> If you want to have a little versatility in your camping pots and pans while still saving on bulk and weight, a combo unit is a good idea. There are pot and pan sets where the lid doubles as a pan, so that<!--more--> you don't have to carry a separate pot and pan. Since most camping meals are the kind of thing you do in one pot or one pan, you wont often run in to the problem of needing a lid and a pan at the same time.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pots and Pans</h2>
A select few of the best camping pots and pans for sale.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/backcountry-titanium-cookset-1650ml\">BackCountry Titanium Cookset</a> - This <strong>titanium</strong> cookset from Backcountry is a good example of the <strong>combination lid and pan</strong>. Each unit has its own attached, folding handle, so you wont burn any fingers, and there's no need to carry a separate pot gripping device. It's also <strong>non-stick</strong>, which makes cleaning in the outdoors easy, and the pot <strong>holds 1300 ml of water</strong>, which is plenty of room for a big meal. The whole set <strong>weighs 6.5 ounces, or 184 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401157/msr-alpine-2-pot-set\">MSR Alpine 2 Pot Set</a> - This Alpine set from MSR is <strong>stainless steel</strong>, which means it's plenty strong enough to take a little use and abuse in the outdoors. You <strong>get two pots, one 1.5 L and one 2 L</strong>, as well as a single <strong>lid for both that also doubles as a pan</strong>. With this set you also get a gripper device that is compatible with all three units in the set. The whole set, however, <strong>weighs 26 ounces, or 737 grams</strong>, and even with the extra pot that is quite a bit.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/trek-900-titanium-cook-set\">Snow Peak Trek 900 Titanium Cookset</a> - The Trek 900 is fairly similar to the BackCountry unit above. It's <strong>titanium</strong>, and comes with a built in handle on both the pot and the pan, which also <strong>doubles as a lid for the pot</strong>. It weighs <strong>6.2 ounces, or 175 grams</strong>, so slightly lighter than the Backcountry cookset, but the Trek 900 is also slightly smaller, with a <strong>900 ml capacity</strong>. So better suited to cooking for 1, rather than the Backcountry which would do well cooking for two.</li>

Meals like pasta and soup are great, and all you need is a pot for something like that, but if you want to get a little more fancy, and do a bit of frying, then it helps to have something like a stand alone <strong>camping frying pan</strong>. That does not necessarily mean, however, that you have to add a lot of bulk and weight to your backpack. There are some excellent camping frying pans on the market.
<h2>Camping Frying Pan</h2>
What to look for on a camping frying pan.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Combo Unit -</strong> If you already have a good camping pot then this may not interest you too much, but there are some great combo cooking sets available, where<!--more--> you get a pot and a lid, and the lid doubles as a frying pan. It's a great way to save on bulk and weight while still expanding your available cookware options.</li>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There are a couple of different materials that you will find camping frying pans in. Stainless steel and aluminum are good, but titanium is better, in that it is both strong and lightweight. The only drawback is that it is also often fairly expensive.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Frying Pan</h2>
A few of the better camping frying pans on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-pinnacle-frypan\">GSI Outdoors Pinnacle Frypan</a> - The Pinnacle makes an ideal camping frying pan. It is <strong>aluminum, and has a teflon coating</strong> which means it's non-stick, and easy to clean in the outdoors. It comes with a handle that's removable, to make it a less awkward item to pack. It <strong>holds a total of 11.9 L, but weighs 12 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>, so not the lightest piece of camping equipment.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783955/msr-flex-skillet\">MSR Flex Skillet</a> - The Flex is another <strong>aluminum pan that has also has a non-stick coating</strong>, which is again, a great feature to have in the outdoors when it comes time to clean up after yourself. It also has a removable handle. The Flex is quite a bit smaller than the Pinnacle, but it also weighs quite a bit less, at <strong>7 ounces, or 198 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/trek-900-titanium-cook-set\">Snow Peak Trek 900 Titanium Cook Set</a> - If you don't have a good camping pot, or are interested in upgrading, this is a great set of cookware from Snow Peak. It's a <strong>pot and lid combo, and the lid doubles as a frying pan</strong>. The lid has its own removable handle, but is quite small, and is definitely only big enough for a single person. The entire unit, however, <strong>weighs a mere 6.2 ounces, or 175 grams</strong>, which is less than either of the frying pans above, so as lightweight options go, it's a great pick.</li>

It feels great against the skin, is a lightweight option that wont add too much weight to your backpack, and will add an appreciable amount of warmth to your sleeping bag, extending your temperature rating by a few degrees or more. So <strong>silk sleeping bag liners</strong> are a great choice.
<h2>Silk Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
What to look for from a silk sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood -</strong> This one is more of a personal preference, but if you want a good sleep, and especially if you are looking to add warmth to your sleeping bag, you should be getting a silk sleeping bag liner with a hood. You lose a lot of body heat out of your head, and supplementing your sleeping bag's hood can help prevent that. A hold can also help keep your sleeping bag liner properly aligned in your sleeping bag if you're the kind of person that likes to toss and turn at night.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape -</strong> You should make sure to get a silk sleeping bag <!--more-->liner that matches the shape of your sleeping bag. If you have a rectangular sleeping bag then either a mummy shaped sleeping bag liner or a rectangular sleeping bag liner will do, but for a mummy shaped sleeping bag, rectangular sleeping bag liners will be a waste of fabric.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Silk Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
Reviews of the better silk sleeping bag liners out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-100-silk-sleeping-bag-liner\">Rab 100% Silk Sleeping Bag Liner</a> - This silk sleeping bag liner from Rab comes in a <strong>wide variety of sizes and shapes</strong>, including both mummy and rectangular, for either shape of sleeping bag. The mummy version <strong>weighs 4.5 ounces, or 128 grams</strong> (the weights on backcountry.com are wrong). There is no word on how much warmth you can expect to add with it, and it also does not come with a hood, which may or may not be what you are looking for.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708744/cocoon-silk-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Silk Mummy Liner</a> - Another silk sleeping bag liner, this time from Cocoon. This one does come with a <strong>hood, as well as a drawstring</strong> on the hood to keep all of that warm air in. REI lists it as adding 9.5 degrees in one place and 5 degrees in another. 5 degrees is believe, 9.5 less so. It <strong>weighs 4.7 ounces, or 130 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/premium-silk-travel-liner\">Sea to Summit Premium Silk Travel Liner</a> - Another silk sleeping bag liner, this time from Australian manufacturer Sea to Summit. This one comes in a <strong>variety of shapes and sizes</strong>, including a mummy shape with a <strong>hood</strong>. You can supposedly expect 10 degrees of added warmth, though I certainly wouldn't count on that much. The <strong>mummy version weighs 4.8 ounces, or 136 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Silk</h2>
Of course, silk isn't the only material that you can find a good sleeping bag liner in. <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/toaster-microfleece-mummy-liner\">Fleece</a> is another popular option, and there are plenty of <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/cocoon-egyptian-cotton-mummy-liner\">cotton sleeping bag liners</a> as well.

When the sun goes down it can be difficult to find that certain something in the bottom of your bag, or make your way back to your tent without putting a few dents in your shins. For those situations, and many more, you want the <strong>best camping flashlight</strong> that you can get your hands on to light your way.
<h2>Best Camping Flashlight</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for the best camping flashlight.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> There's nothing worse than a flashlight low on batteries. You can carry extra batteries with you, but a batter strategy is to get a camping flashlight that is easy on the batteries, and that will go a long time before the battery needs to be replaced.</li>
	<li><strong>Lumens -</strong> Related to battery life is the lumens, or brightness, that your camping flashlight puts out. You are probably not going to need to illuminate the entire forest, so you don't need an especially powerful camping flashlight, but you<!--more--> will want something that at least illuminates your immediate area well. Related to this, the best camping flashlights will have multiple power settings, so that you can have power when you need it, and save batteries when you don't.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Flashlight Reviews</h2>
There are plenty of camping flashlights out there, but these are some of the best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus Headlamp</a> - A flashlight is good, but a headlamp is better. If you're looking for that certain something at the bottom of the bag, for instance, it helps if you have both hands free, in which case a headlamp is ideal. The Tactikka is a small, lightweight headlamp with <strong>three different power settings, and 150 hours of battery life</strong> on the lowest setting. It weighs just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>, and also has a red lens covering that will preserve your night vision. A great all around headlamp.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/632461/photon-micro-light-ii-led-light\">Photon Micro Light II LED Light</a> - If you just want something that will illuminate your immediate area and not add a lot of weight or bulk to your backpack, the Micro is a great choice. It <strong>weighs just .17 ounces, or 5 grams, but manages 120 hours of battery life</strong>. It's small, cheap and works great as a very basic camping flashlight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/amp-3-5-flashlight\">Princeton Tec Amp 3.5 Flashlight</a> - If you need a real flashlight that you can hold in your hand, then the Amp is a great choice. It's bright, at <strong>100 lumens</strong> on the high setting, and will last a total of <strong>112 hours on the low setting</strong>. It's also quite light, at <strong>4.3 ounces or 112 grams</strong>, so you wont have to worry about too much weight and bulk in your backpack.</li>

A waterproof headlamp will perform well in the rain, and will even suffer being dropped in a puddle or a body of water for a limited amount of time without damage. The outdoors can be a wet place, after all, and you shouldn't have to baby your outdoor equipment.
<h2>Waterproof Headlamp</h2>
What to look for from a waterproof headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> As with any light source you take with you in the outdoors, one of your chief concerns with a waterproof headlamp is what kind of battery life you can expect. On longer trips especially, you don't want to have to carry along extra batteries, and so a headlamp with a good, long battery life is essential.</li>
	<li><strong>Light Output -</strong> Depending on what you're using the headlamp for, you may want more or less light output. Fortunately, many of the best headlamps come with several <!--more-->different power settings, so that you can vary the power output, or lumens, to suit your needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Headlamp</h2>
There are many headlamps out there, but these are a few of the best waterproof variety.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tikka-xp-2-headlamp\">Petzl Tikka XP 2 Headlamp</a> - Petzl makes a lot of excellent headlamps, and the XP 2 is a good example of that. It has <strong>three different power settings, with 80 hours of battery life</strong> on the lowest setting. It also has a red light setting, which will preserve your night vision. Best of all, however, the XP 2 <strong>weighs just 3.1 ounces, or 87 grams</strong>, making it the lightest waterproof headlamp on this light.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm Headlamp</a> - The Storm gives you a wide range of lighting options for a wide variety of conditions. You have <strong>anywhere from 25 lumens up to 100 lumens</strong> available to you, and a dimmer switch means you can fine tune the amount of light you get. Battery life is anywhere from <strong>50 hours on high to 200 hours on low</strong>, and it also has two red LEDs, which will preserve night vision when used. The Storm <strong>weighs 3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong>, so a little heavier than the XP 2, but also with a few more options.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/apex-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Headlamp</a> - The Apex is the biggest and the best from Princeton Tec. It has an over the head strap, which the other two headlamps are missing, which might be a useful feature for some people. It has a total of <strong>5 LED lights</strong> on it, which is more than either of the other two headlamps, and can pump out a total of <strong>200 lumens</strong>, which is significantly more than either of the other headlamps. The weight, however, is also significantly more, at <strong>9.8 ounces, or 279 grams</strong>, so you trade brightness for a heavier backpack.</li>

You might think that a camping water bottle is a simple enough choice to make, but even in the area of water bottles, camping manufacturers have made a number of innovations, so that there is quite a lot to choose from when it comes to water bottles for camping.
<h2>Camping Water Bottle</h2>
What to look for from a good camping water bottle.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Water is already heavy enough, so there is no reason to add to the weight by lugging around a heavy water bottle too. For those who are carrying their camping gear in a backpack, this point is especially important, but if you're car camping or something similar, you might not care as much.</li>
	<li><strong>Chemical Free -</strong> Many camping water bottles were guilty of using plastics that gave off BPA in to the water that you then drank. While manufacturers have generally addressed the BPA problem, there is always the possibility of other chemicals lurking in plastics. Many people stick to stainless steel for this reason, and <!--more-->if you're worried about it, stainless steel is definitely a viable option with less risks in this department.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Water Bottle</h2>
The very best camping water bottles.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-bottle-12-40-oz\">Kleen Kanteen Stainless Steel Bottle</a> - If you want to stay away from plastics and prefer <strong>stainless steel</strong> instead, you wont do much better than the Kanteen from Kleen. The Kanteen comes in <strong>four different sizes, from 12 ounces, or 350 ml, up to 40 ounces, or 1.2 liters</strong>. Stainless steel is not light, however, and the <strong>smallest Kanteen weighs 4 ounces, or 113 grams, while the largest weighs 11 ounces, or 312 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/402049/nalgene-wide-mouth-loop-top-round-bottle-32-fl-oz\">Nalgene Wide-Mouth Loop Top Round Bottle</a> - It's hard to beat a classic. Nalgenes are durable, relatively light and have all the right features that a water bottle can have, the wide mouth in particular coming in handy a lot. This particular model <strong>holds 32 ounces, or .95 liters, and weighs 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-cas0448\">Platypus Platy Plus Bottle</a> - The Platy Plus is something a little different. The most frustrating thing about water bottles for backpackers is that when you're not using them they're extremely bulky. The Platy Plus solves that problem. It's made out of a <strong>flexible plastic that can actually be flattened and rolled up</strong> when not in use. It's also much lighter than either of the other two options, at just <strong>1 ounce, or 28 grams for the 2 liter option</strong>. It also comes in a 1 liter size.</li>

But some of it, like mountain slopes, you might not be able to get close to, and other stuff, like bears, you might not want to get very close to. For such situations, a good pair of <strong>backpacking binoculars</strong> are a handy thing to have available.
<h2>Backpacking Binoculars</h2>
What to look for from a good pair of backpacking binoculars.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> It's wet out there on the trail, and sensitive gadgets, such as binoculars, may be sensitive to even small amounts of water. Which is why it is a smart idea to get waterproof binoculars when you are looking for a pair of binoculars to take backpacking with you.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Backpackers have to carry all of their own gear, so if you are going to carry a pair of binoculars while backpacking, you might as well make them lightweight <!--more-->binoculars. This is especially true if you plan to hang the binoculars around your neck, which might get a touch uncomfortable with a heavy pair of binoculars and a long day on the trail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Binoculars</h2>
The very best in backpacking binocular technology.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/744595/nikon-trailblazer-atb-waterproof-8-x-25-binoculars\">Nikon Trailblazer ATB Waterproof Binoculars</a> - These first pair of binoculars are from a very well respected name in everything optics, Nikon. They're <strong>waterproof, and come equipped with 8x zoom</strong>, to bring what is far away closer to you. They also have a bit of extra rubber armor on the exterior, so that they don't get damaged in the course of getting bumped around while backpacking. They <strong>weigh 9.9 ounces, or 280 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-echo-zoom-monocular-10-30x21\">Brunton Echo Zoom Monocular</a> - Why take a lens for both eyes when you can just take one instead. A <strong>monocular</strong> is a great way to save on weight for those backpackers who are trying to meet a lightweight backpacking goal. This particular monocular provides anywhere from <strong>10x to 30x zoom</strong>, and weighs just <strong>3.2 ounces, or 91 grams</strong>. You should note, however, that it's not waterproof, but then it's also small enough to slip in to a clothing pocket or backpack pocket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721658/nikon-eagleview-zoom-8-24-x-25-compact-binoculars\">Nikon Eagleview Compact Binoculars</a> - Another pair of binoculars from Nikon. These are a bit bigger and better, with <strong>8x to 24x zoom</strong>. They're not waterproof or even water resistant, but they do come with a <strong>leather carrying case</strong> which will help to keep them from being exposed to the elements too much.

Even when you're on a predefined trail, things can happen, and a <strong>camping compass</strong> can be your answer for finding a route safely out of a bad situation. And when you venture off the trail and in to the back country, a compass is a very necessary tool to have at your disposal to get you from your departure point to your destination without too many detours along the way.
<h2>Camping Compass</h2>
Features to look for before buying a camping compass.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sighting Mirror -</strong> If you're going to be using a compass on a regular basis, then a sighting mirror is a must have feature. It allows you to line up the compass face with your line of direction, so you can get a point of reference on the landscape to walk towards while making sure that you are heading in the right direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjustable Declination -</strong> There is a difference between true north and magnetic north, and if you plan to be using a map and a compass to navigate, you will need a <!--more-->compass that can adjust for the difference between the two. You will also need to know the difference between the two for the area you are in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Compass</h2>
The best camping compasses to take along on your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-8099-pro-compass\">Brunton 8099 Pro Compass</a> - The 8099 is a top of the line compass. Besides doing the basic job of pointing you in the right direction, it also has a <strong>sighting mirror and adjustable declination</strong>.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787189/suunto-mc-2-pro-compass\">Suunto MC-2 Pro Compass</a> - The MC-2 is a great compass that has all of the basic features you need for navigation and nothing else.

But gadgets like cameras are also fairly delicate, which is never a good mix with hiking, camping or backpacking. For that reason, you should invest in a good <strong>hiking camera bag</strong> to protect your camera from bumps and bruises until you need it for that perfect shot.
<h2>Hiking Camera Bag</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hiking camera bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> First and foremost, a hiking camera bag should be waterproof. The outdoors can be a wet place, after all, and most cameras are not built to be exposed to much or any water. For that reason, a waterproof camera bag is an essential piece of gear to have with you.</li>
	<li><strong>Bump Proof -</strong> A camera bag for hiking should also protect your camera from bumps. You might fall while hiking, for instance, and the last thing you want <!--more-->is your camera getting beat up on some rocks in the process.</li>
	<li><strong>Quick Access -</strong> The ideal hiking camera bag should also offer you quick and easy access to your camera. Often, nature does not stand still and pose for you, and getting a good shot may depend on how quickly you can get that camera out and pointed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Camera Bag</h2>
Only the best hiking camera bags to protect your camera on the trail.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountainsmith-descent-at-chest-pack\">Mountainsmith Descent AT Chest Pack</a> - If you like to take something a little bigger than just a simple point and shoot, a chest pack is a great camera bag to take. It works just like a backpack, but sits on your chest, rather than your back. The most obvious benefit of this design is that you have <strong>quick and easy access to your camera</strong>. The Descent has a velour lining to protect your camera, lenses and accessories, and a <strong>storm cover</strong> for when the weather gets ugly. The whole unit <strong>weighs 1 pound 1 ounce, or 482 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785970/lowepro-apex-30-aw-camera-pouch\">Lowepro Apex 30 AW Camera Pouch</a> - The Apex is something a little smaller,<strong> ideal for a point and shoot size camera</strong>. Internally, it's divided in to an area for your camera and another for accessories. It has a <strong>storm cover</strong> that can be pulled over for when rain starts falling, and even has a handy attachment tab so that you can put it on your belt. Also comes with a detachable shoulder strap if you prefer carrying your camera there. The bag <strong>weighs 3.5 ounces, or 99 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/mountainsmith/cyber-ii-camera-case-recycled\">Mountainsmith Cyber II Camera Case</a> - Another <strong>point and shoot camera bag</strong>, this time from Mountainsmith. It comes in a few <strong>different sizes for different sizes of camera</strong>, which is a nice touch, and has a belt carrying option as well as a shoulder carry option. It also has a <strong>velcro opening</strong>, which will save a few seconds when you need your camera out fast. The <strong>small weighs 3.2 ounces, or 90 grams</strong>.</li>

Many people are also recording their hikes and backpacking trips with GPS data, which allows others to follow in their footsteps, provided they have a GPS unit with them. There aren't too many electronics that are very useful in the outdoors, but a GPS unit is definitely one of them.
<h2>GPS for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when reviewing GPS units for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof  -</strong> It almost goes without saying, but any GPS for hiking should be waterproof. Your navigation needs aren't likely to stop when it starts raining, so you need  a GPS unit that will perform in any and all conditions. Fortunately, most handheld GPS units are waterproof.</li>
	<li><strong>Feature Rich -</strong> If all you need is GPS then there are plenty of options available, but giving you your position is just one of many things that some GPS units do. Radios, altimeters and compasses are just a few of the many extended features you can expect to find on higher end GPS units.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> As with any electronic device that you take in to the outdoors, you want something that will last a long time without needing its batteries<!--more--> replaced. Carrying extra batteries with you, after all, is never very much fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best GPS for Hiking</h2>
The very best GPS units for hikers, backpackers and other outdoor adventurers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-etrex-legend-h\">Garmin eTrex Legend H</a> - If all you need is something to tell you your position, the Legend is ideal. It's <strong>waterproof, will last for 18 hours on full batteries</strong>, and comes preloaded with full base maps of North America and South America. Beyond that, it doesn't do a whole lot. It doesn't even include a digital compass, which is a fairly common feature on GPS units. So <strong>if you want just the basics, this is a good choice</strong>. The Legend <strong>weighs 5.3 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/825518/garmin-rino-650-gps2-way-radio\">Garmin Rino 650 GPS</a> - The Rino 650 represents the other end of the spectrum from the Legend above. Besides telling you your position, it also functions as a <strong>two way radio, weather radio, altimeter, digital compass, and will even download and display satellite imagery with a subscription</strong>. A bright, color touchscreen round out the excellent feature list. The <strong>battery only goes for 14 hours, but is rechargeable</strong>, so no need to keep buying new ones. The Rino 650 <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, or 320 grams</strong>, so quite a bit heavier than the Legend, but quite a bit more functionality too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/garmin-gps/oregon-450-gps-unit\">Garmin GPS Oregon 450</a> - If you only want to have to own one GPS unit, the Oregon 450 is an ideal choice. You can choose from five different profiles, which are <strong>automotive, marine, recreation, fitness and geocache</strong>, so no matter what you are doing, the Oregon can keep up. It also comes equipped with an <strong>altimeter, compass and a 3.2 megapixel camera</strong>. If you want versatility, this is it. The Oergon <strong>weighs 6.8 ounces, or 192 grams</strong>.</li>

They provide you with a good deal of security and peace of mind, particularly if you're by yourself in the outdoors, or have someone back in civilization that worries about you. Not all personal locator beacons are created equal, however, and it can be useful to look at a <strong>personal locator beacon comparison</strong> before you buy one.
<h2>Personal Locator Beacon Comparison</h2>
Personal locator beacons, broken down by their price point.
<h3><strong>High End Personal Locator Beacons</strong></h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/acr-sarlink-view-406-personal-locator-beacon.html\">ACR SARLink 406 GPS Personal Locator Beacon</a> represents the higher end of the PLB spectrum. It gives you a <strong>test mode</strong>, to make sure everything is working, and the ability to <strong>send \"I'm Ok\" messages, as well as GPS data to friends or loved ones</strong> who can then track<!--more--> your progress. The unit works by sending an initial 406 MHz signal to the subscription free Search and Rescue satellite upon activation, which gives Search and Rescue your location and other pertinent information. It then broadcasts a 121.5 MHz signal to allow ground searchers to home in on your location. It also comes equipped with a <strong>bright strobe light</strong>, to help rescuers locate you. A really all around excellent personal locator beacon.
<h3><strong>Medium Range Personal Locator Beacons</strong></h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791972/mcmurdo-fast-find-210-personal-locator-beacon-with-gps\">McMurdo Fast Find 210 Personal Locator Beacon with GPS</a> is a good example of a medium range PLB. It has the <strong>same basic functionality as the ACR model above</strong>. It uses a 406 MHz signal sent to the subscription free Search and Rescue satellite, and then a 121.5 MHz signal to help rescuers close in on your location. <strong>What is lacks is the extras</strong>, like the ability to send \"I'm Ok\" messages to loved ones and friends, or a fully functioning strobe light to help rescuers find you in the dark. But it does have the basic functionality that will alert rescuers to your location, which is the crucial part.
<h3><strong>Low End Personal Locator Beacons</strong></h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gps-satellite-messenger\">SPOT GPS Satellite Messenger</a> represents the lower end of the spectrum when it comes to personal locator beacons. The SPOT does actually give you the ability to <strong>send \"I'm Ok\" messages and GPS data</strong> to loved ones and friends, and also signal to rescuers that you need help. Where it really falls short, however, is that you are <strong>required to purchase a subscription with SPOT</strong>, whereas most other PLBs are free to use. The SPOT is actually the cheapest PLB on this list, but with a <strong>$99 annual subscription</strong>, your costs will add up over time."

There are actually quite a few options available to you when you go hiking, as far as <strong>hiking food</strong> goes, and you certainly don't have to stick to the staples of outdoor food, like energy bars. But then there's nothing wrong with the staples either. But depending on what kind of cooking equipment you are taking, you can actually get fairly gourmet with your hiking food.
<h2>Hiking Food</h2>
All the best hiking food, broken down by meal time.
<h3><strong>Hiking Food - Breakfast</strong></h3>
Most people probably wont want to get too fancy when it comes to breakfast in the outdoors. A couple handfuls of granola or trail mix suffices for many people. But if you are willing to turn that stove on and heat some water, you definitely have a few options available to you.

A hot cup of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/1641/camping-coffee-maker/\">coffee</a> or tea should be near the top of anyone's breakfast list. Oatmeal is another popular outdoor staple that is both easy to make and tasty in the morning. You can<!--more--> mix your own, or just as easily get some <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695496/maryjanesfarm-organic-outrageous-outback-oatmeal\">premixed oatmeal</a> that just requires hot water. And just because you're in the outdoors, that does not mean that staples of home, like <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-house-scrambled-eggs-w-bacon-breakfast-entree\">eggs and bacon</a>, are not an option.
<h3><strong>Hiking Food - Lunch</strong></h3>
If you're on the trail and racking up miles you may not want to spend too much time on lunch. For most people, a quick pit stop and snack are sufficient for lunch.

Trail mix is always good at lunch. It's quick, filling and tasty, depending on what kind you get. If you want to supplement that, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/organic-bananas-1-person\">dried fruit</a> goes well with trail mix, as does <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804538/tanka-bar-buffalo-cranberry-jerky-bites\">jerky</a>. And if you don't have time to stop and want to eat on the go, <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/clifbar-clif-bars-12-pack\">Clifbars</a> are always an option.
<h3><strong>Hiking Food - Dinner</strong></h3>
Dinner is always the most important meal when you find yourself in the outdoors. You've just put in a long day of hiking, and you want something hot and filling to relax with. At the same time, you don't want to spend a lot of time putting something elaborate together. Single pot meals are always ideal when it comes to hiking food.

The staple for trail food at dinner is pasta, or some variation on the dehydrated noodles and sauce theme. Dried noodles are lightweight, take very little time to make and are just about impossible to ruin. They're also extremely filling, which is an important criteria when hiking. And you can do a lot of things with the sauce to give some variety. Something like pesto, for instance, is lightweight and tasty, and different enough from what you normally get to keep things interesting.

Of course if all you can be bothered to do is heat water, there is always the meal in a pouch option. Tasty variations like <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/510134/mountain-house-beef-stroganoff-for-two\">Beef Stroganoff</a>, <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-house-pasta-primavera-1-serving-entree\">Pasta Primevera</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/santa-fe-chicken-2-person\">Santa Fe Chicken</a> are all easy, tasty and filling.

And there is always <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mocha-mousse-pie-2-person\">desert</a> in a pouch for after dinner if you're so inclined."

But that is not to say that there is not a place for a good <strong>stainless steel camping cup</strong>. Stainless steel is heavier than titanium, but it also stands up better to use and abuse. Stainless steel is also typically quite a bit cheaper than titanium, which another advantage that many people appreciate.
<h2>Stainless Steel Camping Cup</h2>
What to look for when looking for a good stainless steel camping cup.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size -</strong> Always check to see what the size of your camping cup is before purchasing. Pictures on websites can be deceiving, and cups will come in a wide variety of sizes. Knowing the weight of the cup will help, but most cups should have a capacity listed, which you will want to at least glance at.</li>
	<li><strong>Handle -</strong> Particularly when hot beverages are involved, a handle is an important feature to have on a camping cup, stainless steel or otherwise. The <!--more-->best handles are those that fold around the cup when not in use. That way, you don't have any unnecessary bulk taking up room in your backpack when you're not using the cup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Stainless Steel Camping Cup</h2>
There aren't too many stainless steel camping cups to choose from out there, but these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-glacier-bottle-cup-pot-18fl-oz\">GSI Outdoors Glacier Bottle Cup / Pot</a> - Is it a cup, or a pot? Well, it's somewhere in between. With a <strong>capacity of 18 fluid ounces, or .5 liters</strong>, you could use this as a small pot just as easily as you could use it as a big cup. It has a <strong>folding handle</strong>, which suits either purpose well, and <strong>weighs 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams</strong>, which is certainly a reasonable weight for a stainless steel cup of this size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/space-saver-cup\">Olicamp Space Saver Cup</a> - The Space Saver is another large cup that could conceivably double as a small pot in a pinch. It will <strong>hold 16 fluid ounces, which is .47 liters</strong>. It is also the perfect size to slide on to the bottom of a 1 liter nalgene bottle, or any other bottle of a similar size, which is where the space saver name comes from. It also has folding handles that help to further reduce unnecessary bulk.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-sierra-cup\">LiCamp Stainless Steel Sierra Cup</a> - Something a little different, from LiCamp. This stainless steel cup is actually fairly tapered, giving it a unique design. It also has a handle that does not fold down, unfortunately, but will keep your hands away from the potentially hot surface of the cup. The whole thing <strong>weighs 3.6 ounces, or 102 grams, but will only hold .33 liters</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Stainless Steel</h2>
If you don't mind spending a bit more, titanium is a great upgrade from stainless steel. It's strong enough to take some abuse, but much lighter. The only disadvantage is that it's also quite a bit more expensive. Snow Peak makes a great <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">double walled cup</a> with a folding handle, but there are plenty of other titanium options out there to choose from."

	p.content = "<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-alpinist-bivy\"><img class=\"alignright size-medium wp-image-2478\" title=\"Bivy Sack vs Tent\" src=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Bivy-Sack-vs-Tent-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"Bivy Sack vs Tent\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a>Most campers, backpackers and campers go assume that they need a tent, without ever realizing that there is another very viable option for keeping the weather away from you while you sleep, which is the bivy sack. The <strong>bivy sack vs tent</strong> debate is a good one to have, because most people come out of it realizing that bivy sacks are actually a great option, with a lot of positives in their column. For one, they weigh a lot less than a tent, and take up a lot less room in a backpack.
<h2>Bivy Sacks</h2>
First, it has to be said that <strong>when it comes to weight, bivy sacks easily win out</strong>. Even a heavier bivy sack will be in the same weight range as only the lightest tents. So in terms of weight, point goes to bivy sacks. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-alpinist-bivy\">Marmot Alpinist</a>, for example, weighs just 14 ounces, or 396 grams, and it is far from the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/bivy-bags/\">lightest bivy sack</a> out there.

<strong>Also in the bivy sack column is the footprint</strong>. Some tents need quite a large clear, flat area to set up, but a bivy sack requires very little space, and does not need good ground for tent pegs and the like. Even bivy <!--more-->sacks that come with a pole built in, like the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747832/outdoor-research-alpine-bivy\">Outdoor Research Alpine Bivy</a>, have a very minimal footprint.

<strong>The major failing of bivy sacks is waterproofing</strong>. It would be easy enough to make a truly waterproof bivy, but then the interior of the bivy would get more than a little damp, and you would end up getting wet from the inside, rather than the outside. Materials like Gore-Tex are good, but not good enough in something like a rainstorm. <strong>Adding a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">tarp</a> to your setup helps to solve this problem, but also adds weight and bulk</strong>, the lack of which is one of the big advantages of bivy sacks.
<h2>Tents</h2>
<strong>Where bivy sacks lack most, in protecting you from the weather, tents excel</strong>. Even a simple, <a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">single wall tent</a> does a much better job of keeping you dry and well ventilated. And there are also some very <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-elite-tent-1-p-3-season\">lightweight 2 wall tents</a> out there that do an even better job than single wall designs of protecting you from the world outside.

One of the biggest advantages of tents that bivy sacks cant hope to touch, however, is <strong>the ability to fit more than one person inside</strong>. Two or three person tents help to save a lot of weight, and make camping and backpacking a lot simpler. For a group of three only one three man tent is required, but three bivy sacks are required.

Where tents fall short is in the weight category. <strong>Even the two very lightweight tents above are no match, in terms of weight, for even a moderately lightweight bivy sack</strong>. Tents also have a larger footprint, and while this may not be a problem, depending on where you're setting up camp, it will matter to some.
<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
Bivy sacks are great when you don't have to worry about the weather. If you need a just-in-case shelter, they're ideal. But when the weather gets bad you're likely to be better served by the extra protection and space of a tent.

But storing your food outside of the tent wont prevent a bear from eating all of that food, and leaving you hungry. That's what a <strong>bear canister</strong> is for.
<h2>Bear Canister</h2>
Features to look for on a bear canister.
<ul>
	<li><strong>National Parks Service Approval -</strong> A bear canister is a great way to protect your food anywhere in bear country, but a great many people end up purchasing bear canisters because they are required in a variety of parks throughout the country where park rangers want to prevent bears from looking at campsites as an area where they can get an easy meal. If you plan to go camping or backpacking overnight in a national park, you should check to make sure that your bear canister is approved. Here is the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/bear-canisters.htm\">Olympic Park</a> list of approved bear canisters, for instance, and here is the <a href=\"http://sierrawild.gov/bears/allowed-bear-canisters\">Sierra Wild</a> list of approved bear canisters.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> Bear canisters are heavy. They have to be, to keep the bears away from your food. So if you are carrying a bear canister, you might as well be carrying the lightest bear <!--more-->canister possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity -</strong> If you cant fit all of your food in to your bear canister, you're going to be in trouble. Related to this, make sure that the bear canister has a big enough opening to get your food inside.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Canister</h2>
The best bear canisters around.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\">BearVault BV500</a> - The BV500 is an ideal bear canister. It <strong>won an Editor's Choice Award from Backpacker magazine way back in 2004</strong>. It holds <strong>700 cu, or 11.5 liters</strong>, which is enough room for about a <strong>weeks worth of food, for one person</strong>. It also has an extra wide opening, for all those Mr. Noodles, and has <strong>clear sides, so you can see where things are buried</strong>, and don't have to do too much rooting. Best of all it <strong>weighs just 2.55 pounds, or 1160 grams</strong>, making it the <strong>lightest bear canister on this list</strong>. It's also <strong>approved by the National Parks Service</strong> as of this writing, and there is even a smaller version, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\">BV450</a>, if you don't need something so big.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/624081/garcia-bear-resistant-container\">Garcia Bear-Resistant Container</a> - This bear canister from Garcia is similar to the BV500 in a few ways, but also falls short in a few ways. First, it <strong>holds a similar amount, at 614 cu, or 10 liters, and weighs just a little more, at 2.75 pounds, or 1247 grams</strong>. But black sides and a smaller opening mean that you might have more trouble getting your food in to the container, and then also more trouble trying to find the food, once it's in. That said, it's certainly a viable option for backpacking or camping, and is <strong>approved by the National Parks Service</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - The Bear Keg is one more bear canister, this time from Counter Assault. It <strong>holds slightly more than either of the other containers, at 716 cu, or 11.7 liters, but it also weighs significantly more, at 4.2 pounds, or 1920 grams</strong>. One thing that you might like about the Bear Keg, however, is that it is a bright yellow. Bears will often drag a bear canister away in to the bush, and then in the morning you will have to go hunting for it. <strong>The clear BV500 and the black Garcia will be a lot harder to find than the bright yellow Bear Keg</strong>. The Bear Keg is also <strong>approved by the National Parks Service</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Bear Canisters</h2>
If you're not camping or backpacking somewhere that requires you to store your food in a bear canister, like a national park, for instance, then you can always employ an alternative method to keep bears away from your food. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8FXRJldcpE\">PCT hanging method</a>, for example, is an elegant solution for hanging food out of the reach of bears, and can be done with just a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/766592/sea-to-summit-evac-dry-sack\">stuff sack</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/nitron-carabiner\">carabiner</a>, some <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/blue-water-pre-cut-accessory-cord-3mm-x-50ft\">lightweight cord</a> and a stick."

Even if you don't intend to use your fire starter, it's a great little piece of camping gear to have at the bottom of your bag, just in case of emergencies. Of course they're also useful for just starting a fire to cook your food. There are a couple of different ways that you can go about starting a fire, some that are easier than others.
<h2>Fire Starter - Camping</h2>
What to look for when looking for a <strong>camping fire starter</strong>.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reusable -</strong> Whatever kind of camping fire starter you decide on, you should make sure that it is reusable. You may need to light a few fires, or the weather could make lighting your fire quite difficult. Whatever the case, make sure that you can get more than just a few fires out of your chosen fire starter.</li>
	<li><strong>Weather Proof -</strong> Starting a fire outdoors is not like starting a fire on the stove, or in a fireplace. There is weather in the outdoors, like <!--more-->wind and rain, that can make lighting a fire difficult. Make sure that whatever fire starter you end up deciding on, it is capable of lighting in a wide variety of conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Fire Starter - Camping</h2>
A few of the best fire starters to take with you on your next camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/gerber/bear-grylls-fire-starter?skus_all=true\">Gerber Bear Grylls Fire Starter</a> - Whatever you think of Bear Grylls, Gerber is a dependable name when it comes to outdoor gear. This particular fire starter is the kind that screws apart, and then inside you have a <strong>ferrocerium starter and a metal striker</strong>.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/e-gear-windmill-trekker-series-stormproof-lighter\">E-Gear Windmill Trekker Series Stormproof Lighter</a> - If you don't want to bother with strikers and all that, and want a bit of technology to do the hard work for you, a stormproof lighter is ideal. This particular lighter <strong>will light in winds up to 80 mph, and will light about 1,000 times when full of butane</strong>. It also has a handy wrist lanyard so you don't end up dragging it in the dirt or losing it after you get the fire lit. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>.</li>

Whether it's the ocean, a lake, a river or even a portable backpacking shower, you will need a towel to dry off. Hiking towels, combined with a few other items, make excellent backpacking pillows, and they have a few other additional uses that make them a versatile piece of backpacking equipment to have with you.
<h2>Hiking Towel</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing hiking towels for your next outing.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size -</strong> Hiking towels typically come in a wide variety of sizes, and so you will want to get a size appropriate to you and your body size. Keep in mind, however, that hiking towels are designed to be very efficient, and to absorb much more water than your typical cotton towel, so you really don't need a very big towel to get the job done.</li>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> Hiking towels are not your average cotton towel, though there is no reason you couldn't bring a cotton towel. But <!--more-->materials like microfiber absorb a lot more water and dry a lot faster too, making them ideally suited to hiking, backpacking and camping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Towel</h2>
A few of the better hiking towels currently out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783079/rei-multitowel-lite-large-towel-37-x-235\">REI MultiTowel Lite Large</a> - This hiking towel is a <strong>blend of polyester microfiber</strong>. It can <strong>absorb up to 8 times its weight</strong> in water, and you can wring most of that out and keep on drying. One nice feature is a little loop of fabric on one corner to hang it and allow it to dry. The <strong>large weighs 4.7 ounces, or 133 grams</strong>, and there is a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783078/rei-multitowel-lite-medium-towel-255-x-155\">medium</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783080/rei-multitowel-lite-x-large-towel-49-x-295\">extra large</a> as well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-drylite-towel\">Sea to Summit DryLite Towel</a> - These are <strong>100% microfiber towels</strong>. They absorb far more than their own weight in water, wring out well and dry quickly, the ideal combination for hiking, backpacking or camping. They also have a little loop of fabric to hang from. They come in <strong>five different sizes and three different colors</strong>, so there really is something for everyone.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packtowl-personal\">MSR Packtowl Personal</a> - One more hiking towel, this time from MSR. These are a<strong> blend of polyester and microfiber</strong>, like the REI towel, and also have a little loop of fabric to hang from. The chief difference between most of these towels is the sizes available. This one comes in <strong>four different sizes, and two different colors</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Related to Hiking Towels</h2>
A towel is great, but you may need a few more things to really complete  your outdoor shower experience. A outdoor, <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-pocket-shower\">hanging shower</a>, for instance, is a useful thing to have if you don't have any rivers or lakes handy. <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/1675/backpacking-soap/\">Backpacking soap</a> is another useful thing to have, to really get squeaky clean."

But even when there's snow on the ground running  is still possible, provided you have a good pair of running snowshoes. <strong>Running snowshoes</strong> also make excellent hiking snowshoes, provided you're not venturing off the trail too much.
<h2>Running Snowshoes</h2>
Features to look for when reviewing running snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Snowshoes are fairly heavy, and when you're adding them to shoes that you're already wearing, that can add up to quite a bit of weight on your feet, which can tire you out quickly when running. To help prevent you from getting too tired too fast, try to find running snowshoes that are as lightweight as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Spring Loaded -</strong> One feature that you will find on many running snowshoes is a spring loaded suspension system. This allows you to maintain <!--more-->a more natural stride, which can sometimes be difficult while wearing a pair of snowshoes on your feet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Running Snowshoes</h2>
The best of the best when it comes to running snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - A great pair of running snowshoes from Atlas. They're <strong>lightweight, at just 2.7 pounds, or 1.22 kilograms</strong>, so you wont feel like your're plodding along. The Run snowshoes also have a <strong>spring loaded suspension system</strong> to help you keep a natural stride, and the one pull binding system is a nice touch. The <strong>recommended weight load is 75 to 190 pounds</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/rnr-22-snowshoes\">Kahtoola Rnr 22 Snowshoes</a> - These are fairly similar to the Atlas Runs, in terms of weight, at <strong>2.8 pounds, or 1.27 kilograms</strong>. They also have <strong>adjustable width</strong>, so if you have big feet, or big boots that you like to run in, that's a nice feature to have.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/atlas-snowshoes/snow-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Snow Race Snowshoes</a> - The <strong>lightest snowshoes by far on this list, at 2.08 pounds, or 943 grams</strong>, the Atlas Snow Race snowshoes have a lot going for them. They have the same basic design as the Atlas Runs, but with a <strong>higher quality and lighter aluminum frame, and titanium instead of aluminum cleats</strong>. When it comes to running snowshoes you wont do better than these.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Snowshoes Accessories</h2>
You might be interested in a few accessories to go along with your running snowshoes. <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/search?cat=40003596&amp;page_size=109&amp;hist=cat%2C40003596%3ASnowshoe+Poles&amp;pageSizeRedirect\">Snowshoe poles</a>, for instance, can add a bit of stability when you're running on uneven ground that you cant see, and if you want to travel with your snowshoes, but not have the cleats rip up your other gear, a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/category/40004086\">bag for your snowshoes</a> would be a smart addition."

That is where gaiters come in. <strong>Snow gaiters</strong> are great for trekking through deep powder, where snow is up to your shins, or even higher. The cover the tops of your boots and provide a tight seal around your leg, so that snow wont go down the gaiters.
<h2>Snow Gaiters</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for snow gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Knee High -</strong> Gaiters come in two different sizes, the ones that go up to your lower calf or thereabouts, and the ones that go all the way up to near the knee. For snow, you definitely want a pair that go up to the knee, so that snow wont have a chance to get in over the tops of your gaiters in any but the largest drifts of snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> It should go without saying, but snow gaiters should be waterproof, or at least water resistant. There wont<!--more--> be a lot of snow sticking to your gaiters and getting a chance to melt there, but there will be some, and it would be ideal if that moisture did not immediately get through to your pants and boots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snow Gaiters</h2>
The best snow gaiters, to keep your feet dry when the drifts are large.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769562/mountain-hardwear-ascent-stretch-air-permeable-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Ascent Stretch Air Permeable Gaiters</a> - First up, a great pair of snow gaiters from Mountain Hardwear. They're constructed with a particularly tough version of nylon to keep water and wind out. They're <strong>16 inches high</strong>, which is plenty for snow, and the <strong>boot strap is replaceable</strong>, so you don't have to worry too much about wearing that out. They weigh 9 ounces, or 255 grams, and are <strong>unisex</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - The Crocodiles won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award way back in 1999</strong>, and have only gotten better since. The <strong>upper portion is Gore-Tex</strong>, which is more than capable of handling any snow, and the <strong>lower section is very durable cordura</strong>, to both keep your boots dry and to stand up the abuse that boots typically endure. A really great pair of snow gaiters. Also come in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/equinox/mountain-gaiter\">Equinox Mountain Gaiter</a> - One more pair of winter gaiters, this time from Equinox. These have a <strong>7 inch cordura boot section</strong>, to take the use and abuse that boots normally endure, and a <strong>10 inch waterproof upper section</strong>, for a total of 17 inches of coverage.</li>

Hiking sandals offer an obvious alternative to that problem. Your feet may get dirty, but they also get to breath, and in the process you get to avoid some of the problems that can arise from hot, sweaty feet being crammed in to a boot or shoe all day long. And the <strong>best hiking sandals</strong> are not so much sandals as shoes that just have really good ventilation, so you never have to worry about them coming off or falling apart on you.
<h2>Best Hiking Sandals</h2>
What to look for when you are shopping for hiking sandals.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Good Sole -</strong> What you definitely do not want is a pair of hiking sandals that remind you of a pair of flip flops or something similar. Just because you are wearing sandals, does not mean you have to settle for a poor sole. You're hiking, remember, and a good sole is important, whether you're wearing sandals, shoes or boots.</li>
	<li><strong>Secure to the Foot -</strong> Similar to the point above, you need something that is going to stay securely on your foot for the duration of the hike. If your hiking sandals are <!--more-->going to be flopping around and falling off, there's a good chance you're going to end up hurting yourself.</li>

<h2>Best Hiking Sandals Reviews</h2>
The best hiking sandals, broken down by gender.
<h3><strong>Best Hiking Sandals for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/707782/keen-newport-h2-sandals-mens\">Keen Newport H2 Sandals</a> - The Newports are <strong>more like a shoe with a lot of chunks missing</strong> than a sandal. They have an excellent sole and a raised toe guard to keep your toes safe. Small touches, however, like a <strong>single pull lacing system and antimicrobial foot beds</strong>, are what separate the Newports from the competition. In all, they <strong>weigh 28 ounces, or 790 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/733942/chaco-z1-unaweep-sandals-mens\">Chaco Z/1 Unaweep Sandals</a> - The Unaweeps are a lot more like a sandal. They have a much more <strong>open upper</strong> than the Newports, and a <strong>more basic strap system</strong> that secures your foot in place. The <strong>sole is made by Vibram</strong>, however, so you don't have to worry about these hiking sandals being under performers. All told they <strong>weigh 30 ounces, or 850 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Hiking Sandals for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-newport-h2-sandal-womens\">Keen Newport H2 Sandals</a> - These are the same sandals as the men's Newports above, but with a female cut and sizing. The <strong>more developed uppers are similar to what you get from a proper shoe, but with plenty of ventilation</strong>. A single pull lace system and an <strong>antimicrobial foot bed</strong> are both very nice touches that people will appreciate. An all-around great hiking sandal.</li>

Despite the more sandal look of the Unaweeps you get a very <strong>good Vibram sole</strong>, so you don't have to worry about slipping and sliding around.

For that reason, a good rain jacket is an essential piece of equipment to have for those who spend significant amounts of time in the outdoors. Campers, backpackers and hikers especially should have a good rain jacket on hand, for those days when the weather doesn't cooperate. <strong>Rain jackets for men</strong> are a bit different than jackets for women, though there are a few unisex jackets out there.
<h2>Rain Jackets for Men</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for your next rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ventilation -</strong> The perfect rain jacket allows no moisture in, while allowing plenty of moisture out. Unfortunately, no waterproof fabric is perfect, and so a good compromise is ventilation. Many rain jackets have zippered openings under the armpit to allow air in and out, but other jackets may integrate ventilation in different ways.</li>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> Not all waterproof fabrics are made equal. Gore-Tex is a great fabric, but it's also quite expensive. Nylon with waterproof finishes are quite a bit cheaper, but don't tend to perform as well as Gore-Tex. eVENT is a good, middle <!--more-->of the road fabric that doesn't cost a huge amount but will stick protect you from water. Know your fabrics, and the positives and negatives associated with the fabric that you choose.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rain Jackets for Men</h2>
A few of the very best rain jackets for men currently out on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754256/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> - If price is of no concern, you wont do much better than the Alpha SV. It uses <strong>top of the line, 3L Pro Gore-Tex fabric</strong>. Standard features like <strong>pit zip ventilation</strong> and waterproofed zippers are much appreciated, but the more advanced features, like <strong>hip length, gusseted arms and a storm hood</strong> are what sets this jacket apart. Backpackers and hikers should take note that <strong>high wear areas are reinforced</strong>, so the Alpha SV will survive a backpack without falling apart.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-venture-jacket-mens\">The North Face Venture Jacket</a> - The Venture is a <strong>great value jacket</strong>. It uses <strong>HyVent fabric</strong>, which is a fabric developed by North Face. It's good, it will keep you dry, but it's not as good as Gore-Tex. But then it is also a fraction of the price of your average Gore-Tex jacket. It's also not as feature rich as the Alpha SV, but crucially, it does have <strong>pit zips for easy and effective ventilation</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/marmot/mens-super-mica-jacket?skus_all=true\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - The Super Mica is a <strong>great jacket for backpackers and hikers</strong>. It's extremely lightweight and packs down small, perfect for stuffing in to a backpack. It's also <strong>reinforced in all the right places for backpackers, hikers</strong> and anyone else who carries a backpack. Pit zip ventilation is also included, but not a lot else. The design of this jacket is lightweight, and it doesn't have anything except the essential features.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to the Traditional Rain Jacket</h2>
If you're not worried about fashion, and just want something that functions extremely well, then a poncho is a viable option. Ponchos work especially well for hikers, backpackers and campers, because they give you plenty of protection from the rain and plenty of ventilation as well, which is the ideal combination for those who stay active in the outdoors. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Tarp-Poncho</a> is a perfect example. It's big enough to keep you and your backpack dry, and even doubles as a tarp to shelter under."

<h2>Best Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
A few features that you should be looking for when reviewing soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant -</strong> You wont find any waterproof soft shell jackets, but you should definitely look for soft shell jackets that have some degree of water resistance. A good soft shell jacket should be able to shed enough water to get you through a few showers without needing to pull out a waterproof layer.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets -</strong> Another feature that most people will want on their soft shell jacket is a few zippered pockets. If you're going to be wearing a lot <!--more-->of a soft shell jacket, you will likely want to keep a few things in an easy to access area, especially if you are camping, hiking or backpacking. Most of the best soft shell jackets come with a pocket or two to do just that.</li>

The best hiking pants will keep you warm, well ventilated and will dry quickly if you are unfortunate enough to get a little wet. Of course there are a few differences between <strong>women's hiking pants</strong> and men's hiking pants, and if you're a woman you should definitely be on the lookout for women's hiking pants.
<h2>Women's Hiking Pants</h2>
Features that you want to see when shopping for hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Convertible -</strong> Convertible pants aren't for everyone, but there's no denying that they are a lot more versatile than a regular old pair of pants. When the sun comes out, for instance, you can convert them in to a pair of shorts without even taking them off, and if and when you get cold, they turn right back in to a pair of pants.</li>
	<li><strong>Nylon -</strong> The best hiking pants are usually nylon. Nylon is lightweight, doesn't rip easily and best of all, dries extremely fast when <!--more-->wet. It also feels half decent against the skin. There are some other very good fabrics out there, it's not nylon or nothing, but nylon is definitely one of the best hiking pants materials around.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women's Hiking Pants</h2>
A few of the very best women's hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/prana-monarch-convertible-pant-womens\">prAna Monarch Convertible Pants</a> - A very popular pair of <strong>convertible hiking pants</strong> from prAna. They're <strong>nylon</strong>, so they dry extremely quickly if you happen to get them wet, and <strong>four pockets</strong> means you have plenty of room for a few small essentials. They also have a <strong>straight leg design</strong>, so they look good as either pants or shorts.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/809935/exofficio-nomad-roll-up-pants-womens\">ExOfficio Nomad Roll-Up Pants</a> - ExOfficio is a well known name when it comes to tough, durable outdoor clothing. These particular pants are not convertible, but they will <strong>roll up, as the name suggests, and once rolled up they are held in place with button closures</strong>. They're also nylon, so they will dry quickly, and have a <strong>UPF+ 30 rating</strong>, so you are also well protected from the sun. Finally,<strong> four pockets</strong>, including two cargo pockets, means you have plenty of room for a few essentials.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/the-north-face/womens-horizon-tempest-pants\">The North Face Women's Horizon Tempest Pants</a> - Another pair of <strong>roll up pants</strong>, this time from North Face. They're <strong>nylon</strong>, so again they will dry very quickly, and have a <strong>UPF+ 50 rating</strong>, so plenty of protection from the sun.

Soft shells, for example, make excellent camping jackets. They keep you warm, breath well and will even shed a small amount of rain, from a spring shower, for instance. But it's hard to beat a good rain jacket for camping, because you cant predict the weather, and sometimes it will rain. With a rain jacket, you will be prepared.
<h2>Camping Jackets</h2>
Features to look for when you are looking for a new camping jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> When you're spending any significant amount of time outdoors, like camping for example, it pays to have at least one waterproof layer on hand. If you cant have a waterproof layer, or if you're camping in an area and time of year where rain isn't a big concern, then a water resistant jacket should suffice.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood -</strong> A hood is another important feature to have on your <!--more-->camping jacket. A hood both keeps the water off of your head, and also adds a few degrees of warmth in those times when you need that little boost.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Jackets</h2>
The very best in camping jackets for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Best Camping Jackets for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796005/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket</a> - The Torrentshell is a great all around camping jacket. It's <strong>nylon, with a waterproof coating</strong>, so it wont stand up as well as Gore-Tex, but it's also a much more reasonable price than Gore-Tex. Beyond that, you get a <strong>hood with drawstring</strong>, a hem with a drawstring, and<strong> pit zips</strong> to keep you well ventilated. A great camping jacket for plenty of different conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/boreas-pull-on-men-s\">Rab Boreas Pull-On</a> - The <strong>2011 winner of the Backpacking Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, the Boreas is a lightweight, <strong>soft shell jacket</strong> ideal for campers who want to save weight. It's warm, but it also breathes very well, and even has a UPF 50+ rating, so that you are covered for just about all situations. One of the best features, however, is a <strong>hood, so that you can stay warm when you need to</strong>, and then take off the hood when you want to cool off.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Camping Jackets for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/772278/arcteryx-epsilon-sv-hoodie-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Epsilon SV Hoodie Jacket</a> - A great <strong>soft shell jacket</strong> ideal as a camping jacket for when you don't have to worry too much about rain. It will <strong>shed a limited amount of moisture</strong>, however, so you will survive a spring shower or two. It also has a good <strong>hood with a drawstring</strong>, so that you can vary how much warmth the jacket adds, which makes it ideal for both sitting around camp and being active.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-venture-jacket-womens\">The North Face Venture Jacket</a> - If you're looking for something that will deal better with a little rain, the Venture is ideal. It's made with <strong>North Face's proprietary hyVent fabric</strong>, which is good, but not quite comparable to something like Gore-Tex. Still, it does a good job, and the <strong>price is very attractive</strong>. It's light on features, but does, crucially, have <strong>pit zips</strong> to keep you well ventilated if you like to stay active while camping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camping Jacket Alternative</h2>
If you're more worried about function instead of fashion, you might be bettered served by a poncho for your camping jacket. A poncho will definitely not give you any warmth, but it will give you ample protection from the rain. A poncho will also protect your backpack from the rain, should you be backpacking between campsites. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Tarp-Poncho</a> is a great example. It functions perfectly as a poncho, and even doubles as a tarp for sheltering under at night."

If you are suffering from blisters, hot spots or a wide variety of other possible foot ailments, you're not going to be having any fun, and having fun is the whole point of getting outside and hiking. So a good pair of hiking shoes is important, as is a good pair of hiking socks. <strong>Hiking socks for women</strong>are also a bit different than hiking socks for men.
<h2>Hiking Socks - Women</h2>
Features to look for when you are reviewing hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There are a couple of different fabrics that you can get hiking socks in, but most people will agree that wool is best. Even for warm temperatures, there are many excellent thin wool socks available. Wool wicks moisture away well, breathes well and is a natural antimicrobial, so your socks wont smell awful after a long day on the trail. The perfect material for hiking in.</li>
	<li><strong>Form Fitting -</strong> Socks that aren't fitted for your feet are more likely to wrinkle up in crucial areas, which can cause blisters<!--more--> and general discomfort. Fitted socks will tend to be a bit more expensive, but generally that extra cost is worth it in the foot problems that you wont have to deal with.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Socks - Women</h2>
A few of the very best hiking socks for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/759896/rei-merino-wool-mini-crew-light-hiking-socks-womens\">REI Merino Wool Mini Crew Light Hiking Socks</a> - A good, basic wool sock from REI. <strong>Nylon and Lycra</strong> help to hold shape in the heel and toe areas, and the wool works extremely well to help regulate foot temperatures. Really, what separates this wool sock from the many others out there and on this list is the length. <strong>This particular hiking sock extends only to the top of the ankle</strong>, so the ideal length for shoes, but maybe not for boots with full ankle support.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/icebreaker-hike-lite-crew-sock-womens-ice0229\">Icebreaker Hike Lite Crew Sock</a> - Icebreaker is well known for making excellent wool clothing. First, you get <strong>Merino wool</strong>, which is the good stuff, and a <strong>fitted design</strong> so you'll never have to worry about wrinkles in the sock material giving you blisters. You also get some <strong>extra cushion in high impact areas</strong>, like the bottom of your heels. And these Icebreaker hiking socks extend up to the lower calf, which is ample length for just about any hiking shoe or boot.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/smartwool/womens-phd-outdoor-light-crew-socks\">Smartwool PhD Outdoor Light Crew Socks</a> - When it comes to wool socks, Smartwool makes some excellent products, and the PhD line is the best. You get <strong>Smartwool's 4-way fit design</strong>, plenty of <strong>strategically placed mesh</strong> to make sure your feet are well ventilated, and higher density wool in high impact areas. You wont do much better than PhD socks.</li>

When summer, when the weather is hot, or even in spring, when you're going to be working hard, the ventilation and reduced bulk that shorts provide is a welcome relief from pants. But not all <strong>men's hiking shorts</strong> are made equal. There are, in fact, a few features that you should be on the lookout for when you go to buy that new pair of hiking shorts.
<h2>Men's Hiking Shorts</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for men's hiking shorts.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nylon</strong> - There are plenty of materials that you will find hiking shorts in, but nylon is one of the most popular, and also one of the best. It stands up to wear well, and wont rip easily. It also breathes well, and most important of all, dries extremely quickly. So if you find yourself in a bit of a shower, or end up in a river or lake, you wont have to worry about being wet for long.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets</strong> - Hikers generally like to carry a few things, and it pays to have quick and easy access to a few of the more<!--more--> important things, which is where pockets come in. A few hand pockets are essential, and a few cargo pockets can also work extremely well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men's Hiking Shorts</h2>
A few of the better choices you have when it comes to a new pair of hiking shorts.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794423/rei-adventures-shorts-mens\">REI Adventure Shorts</a> - First, a solid pair of hiking shorts from REI. They're <strong>nylon, so they will dry well</strong>, and also have a <strong>UPF rating of 50+</strong>, so you wont have to worry about getting too much sun. They also provide you with a total of <strong>three zippered pockets</strong>, to keep a few essentials secure, and a few more pockets for your hands and anything else you might want to carry.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-rampart-long-short-mens\">Arc'teryx Rampart Long Short</a> - The Rampart shorts are, as the name implies, a <strong>little longer than your average pair of hiking shorts</strong>, which may be a positive or negative, depending on your preferences. The extra length does give you some extra material to work with if you are especially active, which will definitely be a bonus for some people. The <strong>extra length also leaves room for a couple cargo pockets</strong>, in addition to a few more hand pockets. They're also <strong>nylon</strong>, so you don't have to worry about getting them wet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mojo-shorts-men-s\">Prana Mojo Shorts</a> -  The Mojo hiking shorts from Prana are something a little different. They're <strong>polyester, rather than nylon</strong>, which may be a preference for some people. Fortunately, <strong>polyester dries quickly, just like nylon</strong>. These particular hiking shorts come with a couple of pockets in the usual place, but not much beyond that. If you prefer polyester to nylon, these are an ideal choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Hiking Shorts</h2>
Hiking shorts are great, but for those days when the weather could go either way, and you just cant make up your mind on whether you should be wearing shorts or pants, <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/mountain-hardwear/mens-mesa-convertible-pants\">convertible pants</a> are one excellent option. When you need the warmth of pants you can have it, and when you want a little more ventilation, all you have to do is zip off the bottom half and throw the legs in your backpack."

Wet, cold hands may become stiff and clumsy, for instance, which can be a dangerous situation to find yourself in. You may find yourself unable to do even simple things, like retie your shoelaces, or more importantly, set up a shelter so that you can get out of the rain and get warm. In such a situation, having <strong>waterproof hiking gloves</strong> can be extremely important.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Gloves</h2>
Features to look for when you are reviewing waterproof hiking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - The idea of waterproof, when it comes to camping and backpacking gear, is a bit of a sliding scale. Some materials that claim to be waterproof may keep water out for an hour or two, for example, but will<!--more--> gradually begin to leak as time wears on. So it pays to do your research and know just how waterproof the material you are buying hiking gloves in really is.</li>
	<li><strong>Durability</strong> - It's also important to get a pair of hiking gloves that are at least somewhat durable. You are constantly using your hands, after all, even when you have your waterproof hiking gloves on, and you don't want to be stuck with gloves that will lose all their waterproofing after experiencing a little wear and tear.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Gloves</h2>
A brief look at some of the best waterproof hiking gloves out there, broken down by gender.
<h3><strong>Waterproof Hiking Gloves for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/seirus-xtreme-all-weather-glove\">Seirus Xtreme All Weather Glove</a> - This all weather glove has the <strong>low profile</strong> and look of a soft shell glove, but has a <strong>waterproof membrane outer shell, and a fleece liner inside</strong>, to keep your hands both warm and dry. They also have a nylon coating on the palm so you wont do any damage to them when handling various things. A <strong>great choice if you prefer the low profile look</strong> to the more often seen bulk.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786711/mountain-hardwear-epic-gloves-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Epic Gloves</a> - These are a bit more bulky, and more<strong> reminiscent of a traditional snow glove</strong>. They have a waterproof exterior and a brushed polyester interior, for a little warmth and padding. They also have a <strong>synthetic palm, for durability</strong>, and the traditional gauntlet closure that you find on snow gloves. If you are looking for something warm for the hiking trail, these are a good choice.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Waterproof Hiking Gloves for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-epic-glove-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Epic Gloves</a> - Same basic glove as the men's Epic glove found above, just with a woman's fit. These are <strong>fairly bulky, not unlike a snow glove</strong>, but that tends to be what you have to go for when buying waterproof hiking gloves. But if you need to keep your hands warm, these are a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/743107/seirus-hyperlite-all-weather-gloves-womens\">Seirus Hyperlite All Weather Gloves</a> - If you are wanting something a little more <strong>low profile</strong> than the standard snow glove for hiking in, these are a great choice. They probably aren't the best choice for a rain storm, but if you want to stay reasonably dry, they do a great job while not adding any great amount of bulk.</li>

For that, you need a <strong>backpacking water filter</strong>. A filter is a crucial piece of gear for backpackers, as well as campers and hikers. There are any number of contamination sources, both natural and man made, that ruin an otherwise fun backpacking trip. And if you don't like the idea of having to carry a filter around, there are some alternative options as well.
<h2>Backpacking Water Filter</h2>
Features to look for when buying your next backpacking water filter.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Water filters can get rather heavy, but there is no reason to carry a heavy filter when there are plenty of lightweight backpacking water filter options available. Lighter water filters also tend to be smaller, which helps to cut down on bulk in your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter Lifetime</strong> - Filters always need to be replaced after a certain amount of time, but many will need to<!--more--> be replaced sooner than others. By buying a filter with a long lifetime, you will be able to filter more water before you need to buy a replacement.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Water Filter</h2>
A few of the very best backpacking water filters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-works-filter\">Platypus Gravity Works Filter</a> - Why pump when you can let <strong>gravity</strong> do the work of getting your water through your filter instead. The Gravity Works filter is designed with two pouches, one with the dirty water in it and one for the clean water, and a tube with a filter on it between the two. You hang dirty water higher than the clean water bag, leave for a few minutes and come back to clean water. The Gravity Works <strong>weighs 10.75 ounces, or 304 grams, filters 1.75 liters per minute, and will filter 1501 liters of water before you need to replace the filter</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-hyperflow-microfilter\">MSR HyperFlow Microfilter</a> - The HyperFlow is your standard pump water filter. It <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, however, which helps to set it apart from the competition. It puts out <strong>3 liters of water per minute</strong>, and will last for <strong>1000 liters before you need to replace the filter</strong>. Best of all, it <strong>weighs just 7.4 ounces, or 209 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720265/katadyn-hiker-pro-water-filter\">Katadyn Hiker PRO Water Filter</a> - Another standard pump filter, this time from Katadyn. It weighs <strong>10.9 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>, and only goes for <strong>750 liters before you need to replace the filter</strong>, both of which are worse numbers than the HyperFlow above. Still, it gets plenty of positive reviews, and is a good alternative if you don't like the HyperFlow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Water Purification Alternative</h2>
If you cant see anything floating around in your water, if it already looks clean, then you may just need to purify it. You can go with a UV option, such as the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a>, but if you don't want to have to carry another gadget and the batteries that go with it, you can always take something like <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">water purification tablets</a> instead, which weigh next to nothing and will make your water drinkable."

Many of the <strong>best bivy sacks</strong> offer just as much protection from the elements as a half decent tent would, but with far less weight and bulk, the result of which is a smaller, lighter backpack for you to carry. Not all bivy sacks are made equal, however, and if you want to stay dry at night, you will want to review any bivy sack carefully before purchasing.
<h2>Best Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for when you are looking at bivy sacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bug Proof</strong> - Generally, bivy sacks have an opening at your face, which you use to enter and exit the bivy sack, as well as get some fresh air at night while you sleep. But this hole also offers bugs easy access to your face at night. If you're not camping anywhere where bugs are a problem <!--more-->then it doesn't matter, but many bivy bags come with bug netting built in to cover this area, and keep bugs away at night. You can also supplement your bivy sack, if it doesn't have this feature, by using a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-insect-shield-mosquito-head-net\">bug net</a> over your head.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - It should go without saying, but any good bivy sack should be waterproof. If you're camping or backpacking somewhere that experiences little or no rainfall you could probably get away with a water resistant bivy sack, but waterproof is the safer bet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bivy Sack Reviews</h2>
A select few of the better bivy sacks currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/integral-designs-south-col-bivy\">Integral Designs South Col Bivy</a> - The main thing that stands out about the South Col is that you get <strong>eVENT</strong> protection on the top of the bivy. eVENT is a fabric similar to Gore-Tex, though it is both lighter and cheaper. The South Col is not particularly light, however, at <strong>22 ounces, or 627 grams</strong>, and it also lacks a bug net closure, but eVENT is a great fabric for those who want to stay dry and not get condensation build up inside the bivy sack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Product_Type/Tents/Bivi__Bothy_Bags/Ultra_Bivi_Bag.html?view=description\">Terra Nova Ultra Bivi Bag</a> - An extremely lightweight option from UK manufacturer Terra Nova. The Ultra <strong>weighs an amazing 2 ounces, or 50 grams</strong>, and packs down extremely small. It is also <strong>waterproof</strong>, amazingly enough, because it uses Terra Nova's proprietary version of the cuben fiber fabric. The fabric <strong>does not breath</strong>, however, so you might be a little damp in the morning. The Ultra also <strong>lacks a bug net closure</strong>, but then the bug netting would weigh almost as much as this entire bivy sack does.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810038/msr-ac-bivy\">MSR AC Bivy</a> - The AC uses a more <strong>conventional waterproofing coated nylon</strong> top to make itself waterproof. It also comes with a <strong>bug net built in</strong>, to protect you from bugs at night. It weighs <strong>16 ounces, or 450 grams</strong>, so not nearly as lightweight as the Ultra, but still a good choice for those looking for something a little more conventional.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Redundancy for Bivy Sacks</h2>
The main drawback of any bivy sack is that it has to be both breathable, because of the small space available, and still waterproof. In a heavy rainfall, just about any bivy sack will eventually let water in, which is why it can help to have a little redundancy along with you. A good <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">tarp</a> weighs little, packs down small and is easy to set up over your bivy sack, and will take the brunt of any downpour."

The important thing to remember, regardless of what knife you decide to take hiking with you, is that a knife is only useful if you keep it sharp. It's a good idea to sharpen your knife either after you get back from a trip, or before you go out on your next one if you used the knife much on the previous trip.
<h2>Hiking Knives</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing hiking knives to buy.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - As with most gear that you take with you in to the outdoors, it helps if you get a lightweight hiking knife, as opposed to a big, heavy hiking knife. Remember that you are going to have to carry this knife, and the heavier it is, the more energy you are going to expend hauling it around, and the more tired you will be at the end of the day.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed or Folding</strong> - You have two main choices when it comes to the style of knife you want, and those are a <!--more-->fixed blade or a folding blade. Folding blade knives are typically lighter, but also weaker, because they have a joint, rather than being a solid piece of metal. Fixed blade knives, on the other hand, are usually stronger, being one solid piece, but also heavier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Knives</h2>
A few of the better hiking knives currently out there, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Gerber Big Rock Serrated Knife</a> - For those that prefer a <strong>fixed blade knife</strong> over a folding knife, the Big Rock is a great choice. It's big and strong, with a <strong>4.5 inch blade and a weight of 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>. The lower portion of the blade is also serrated, as the name suggests, which is useful for cutting things like rope. It also comes with a sheath that is easy to thread on to a belt. Again, a good choice for those looking for a fixed blade hiking knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-paraframe-i-serrated-edge-knife\">Gerber Paraframe Serrated Knife</a> - Another knife from Gerber, this time for anyone who prefers a <strong>folding knife</strong>. As the name suggests the lower portion of this knife's blade is also serrated, so that you have a few different cutting options. The <strong>blade length is only 3 inches</strong>, so 1.5 inches shorter than the Big Rock, but the <strong>weight is a very respectable 2.6 ounces, or 73 grams</strong>, which is significantly lighter than the Big Rock. For someone who prefers folding knives for carrying while hiking, this is a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peck-in-the-dark\">Columbia River Peck in the Dark</a> - And in the lightweight category, there is the Peck in the Dark. It's also a folding knife, but with a <strong>blade length of just 1.88 inches and a weight of .9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>, you will hardly even know you're carrying it. You wont be hacking apart any logs with this hiking knife, but it's something sharp for those times when you need just that.</li>

Finding a good pair of <strong>cheap hiking boots</strong>, then, can help save quite a lot of money when outfitting yourself with hiking gear. And provided that you know that features to look for, there is no reason that you cant find a good, quality pair of hiking boots at a reasonable price point.
<h2>Cheap Hiking Boots</h2>
What to look for when you are trying to find a good pair of cheap hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - If you don't need your hiking boots to be waterproof, if you only go hiking in summer conditions, for instance, then there is no reason not to go with a pair of hiking boots that are just water resistant instead. Your feet will likely breath better, and will be less suffocated in your shoe, the shoes will likely be lighter, and you will also save money, as good waterproofing tends to be expensive.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle Height</strong> - If you're just hiking, and not carrying a heavy backpack, then you don't really need the full ankle support found on bigger, more expensive<!--more--> hiking boots, and would probably do fine with something like a mid height boot. This will still provide some ankle support, just like a boot, but will still have a lower profile, and typically, a lower price.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Hiking Boots</h2>
A few of the better pairs of cheap hiking boots currently on the market.
<h3><strong>Cheap Hiking Boots for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-pyrenees-hiking-boot-mens\">Keen Pyrenees Hiking Boot</a> - These are a great pair of lighter hiking boots from Keen. They have a <strong>leather outer</strong>, which means they're fairly durable, and the leather helps to keep water out as well. They also have a <strong>waterproof liner developed by Keen</strong> to help keep your feet dry. At <strong>34 ounces, or 963 grams</strong>, they wont be breaking any lightweight records, but they are quite a bit lighter than many other hiking boots.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sundowner-gtx-boot-men-s\">Vasque Sundowner GTX Boot</a> - On paper the Sundowners have a build similar to the Keen hiking boots above, with a <strong>leather outer and a Gore-Tex liner inside</strong>. But the Sundowner has a style more reminiscent of classic hiking boots, and the Gore-Tex liner is likely a significant improvement over Keen's waterproof liner. They weigh <strong>54 ounces or 1.53 kilograms</strong>, so definitely not lightweight, but you cant have everything.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Cheap Hiking Boots for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/vasque-breeze-gtx-hiking-boot-womens\">Vasque Breeze GTX Hiking Boot</a> - These hiking boots from Vasque have a <strong>combination leather and mesh outer, and an XCR Gore-Tex liner inside</strong> to give your feet some breathability while still keeping water out. They're not the lightest boots ever, at <strong>38 ounces, which is 1077 grams</strong>, but the price is quite reasonable.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/772566/keen-targhee-ii-mid-hiking-boots-womens\">Keen Targhee III Mid Hiking Boots</a> - The Targhee is a <strong>mid height boot</strong> that will give you a good amount of ankle support, but not as much as a more traditional hiking boot. The <strong>nylon mesh and leather outer</strong>, combined with <strong>Keen's waterproof liner</strong> will keep you reasonably dry, and at <strong>30 ounces, or 850 grams</strong>, they're also reasonably lightweight.</li>

Food is an important part of the camping experience, and if you are backpacking from site to site, or hiking from a centralized camping spot, you will want a big, delicious meal to come back to after a long day on the trail. And while there is nothing wrong with doing a little cooking over an open fire, a big hot meal fresh from the cooking pot is a great way to end the day when camping.
<h2>Camping Pots and Pans Set</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing camping pots and pans sets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - There are a few different material choices when it comes to camping pots and pans. Stainless steel is strong, but also quite heavy. Aluminum is lightweight and cheap, but does not stand up well to wear and tear. Titanium is lightweight and stands up decently well to a little wear and tear, but is definitely the most expensive of the three.</li>
	<li><strong>Versatile</strong> - It also helps if your camping pots and pans are versatile, so you don't end up carrying a whole<!--more--> array of cookware. Many pot lids, for instance, are made to double as frying pans, making them a useful, dual use item.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Related to the two points above, you probably want your camping pots and pans set to be lightweight. You don't want to be carrying around big, heavy cookware with you when there are much lighter options available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pots and Pans Sets</h2>
A few of the very best sets of pots and pans for camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-trek-900-titanium-cookset\">Snow Peak Trek 900 Titanium Cookset</a> - If you're just cooking for one, there's no reason to bring along a big set when a small, minimalist set is all you need. The Trek 900 set consists of just a <strong>pot and a lid that doubles as a frying pan</strong>. It's basic, but it's everything you need to cook for yourself. It's also <strong>titanium</strong>, so the whole set weighs just <strong>6.2 ounces, or 175 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/pinnacle-camper\">GSI Pinnacle Camper</a> - The Pinnacle set is everything you need to eat in the outdoors. You get <strong>two pots with lid, strainer combos, a frying pan and 4 cups, bowls, plates and a few other extras</strong>. The cookware is <strong>non-stick coated aluminum</strong>, which is a nice touch when it comes to cleaning up after dinner. The whole set <strong>weighs 3.5 pounds, or 1.58 kilograms</strong>, but you could likely leave some of it at home, depending on how big your group is and what your cooking needs are.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset</a> - This cookset is similar to the other Snow Peak set above, but comes with <strong>two pots and two lid, frying pan combos</strong>, rather than just the one, so you have some options available to you, depending on how many you're cooking for and what you're cooking. And because the set is titanium, the whole thing <strong>weighs just 11.6 grams, or 328 grams</strong>, making it ideal for those more concerned about weight, but looking to cook for more than one.</li>

But when you go camping, for instance, you have a responsibility to help keep the wilderness that way. <strong>Biodegradable soap for camping</strong> is one example of ways in which you can help ensure that your camping or backpacking has as little negative impact as possible on the environment around you.
<h2>Biodegradable Soap for Camping</h2>
Regardless of what kind of soap you get, there are a few things to look for in a good camping soap.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Concentrated -</strong> One important characteristic you should look for in any camping soap is a highly concentrated camping soap. You don't want to have to carry a big bottle of soap when you can make do with a much smaller, more concentrated bottle of soap.</li>
	<li><strong>Versatile -</strong> There are a couple of different things that you might need soap for when camping. The dishes, for instance, as <!--more-->well as your body. Carrying a soap for each individual use is inefficient when you can get soaps that will do every job.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Biodegradable Soap for Camping</h2>
A few of the best biodegradable soaps for camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camping-soap\">Campsuds Camping Soap</a> - This is a highly <strong>concentrated, biodegradable soap for camping</strong>, backpacking or any other outdoor activity. It's <strong>made from natural vegetable derived ingredients, as well as oil essences</strong>. It can be used for anything from <strong>dishes, to hair and skin</strong>. It also comes in <strong>four different sizes, ranging from 2 ounces to 16 ounces</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-wilderness-wash\">Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash</a> - Another biodegradable soap, this time from Sea to Summit. Besides being biodegradable, it is also <strong>phosphate and fragrance free</strong>, so you don't have to worry about any bears sniffing around at your camp soap. It <strong>comes in two different sizes, 1.3 ounces and 3 ounces</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/730925/dr-bronners-organic-liquid-soap-travel-size\">Dr. Bronners Organic Liquid Soap</a> - One more biodegradable camping soap, this time from Dr. Bronners. It comes in <strong>just one size, 2 ounces</strong>, but the great thing about Dr. Bronners is that it <strong>can also be used as toothpaste</strong>. A soapy toothpaste, but regardless, it's one more thing that you can leave at home. It comes in a <strong>few different flavors, including almond and peppermint</strong>, both of which would make good toothpaste flavors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camping Soap Accessories</h2>
Travel sizes are useful, but many of these soaps are highly concentrated, and even the travel sizes are too big. If you want to get a large container of soap, and then only use a little at a time for your outdoor adventures, a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/634320/nalgene-drop-dispenser-bottle-2-fl-oz\">dropper bottle</a> is an extremely useful little accessory to have.

And food really is a priority when you're backpacking. After a long day on the trail, a nice hot meal is a definite requirement, and if you need to add a frying pan to your pot to get that, then it's not such a bad thing.
<h2>Backpacking Frying Pan</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for backpacking frying pans.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - When shopping for backpacking cookware, you have a few different materials to choose from. First, there are many aluminum options out there. Aluminum is lightweight and cheap, but not that sturdy, whereas stainless steel is tougher, but also heavier, and titanium is tough and lightweight, but also very heavy. Choices, choices.</li>
	<li><strong>Combo Set</strong> - Another option you have when shopping for backpacking frying pans is whether to get a standalone <!--more-->unit or a combo unit. There are a few backpacking frying pans out there that come in a set with a pot, and you use the frying pan as the lid for the pot. Since most people will be taking a pot, in addition to a frying pan, this set up saves you from having to carry a separate lid.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Frying Pan</h2>
A few of the better backpacking frying pans available to you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783955/msr-flex-skillet\">MSR Flex Skillet</a> - First up, a great backpacking frying pan from MSR. It's made of <strong>aluminum, and has a non-stick coating</strong>, which a fantastic feature both for cooking in and for after, when you have to clean up. It comes with an <strong>attachable handle</strong>, and has a <strong>diameter of 9 inches and a depth of 2.5 inches</strong>. It weighs a total of <strong>7 ounces, which is 198 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-pinnacle-frypan\">GSI Outdoors Pinnacle Frypan</a> - Another frying pan, this time from GSI. This is a similar frying pan to the MSR one above, being made of <strong>aluminum and with a non-stick finish</strong>, but at <strong>13.2 ounces, or 375 grams for the 8 inch version</strong> (there's a 14 inch version too) it's not nearly as lightweight. If you like the rounded edges, or the larger 14 inch size, then this would be a good choice, but otherwise the MSR is likely a better choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/trek-900-titanium-cook-set\">Snow Peak Trek 900 Titanium Cook Set</a> - If you don't already have a backpacking pot, or are looking to upgrade that too, then this is an ideal set. You get a <strong>pot big enough to cook for one, and the lid doubles as a frying pan</strong>. The only real drawback here is that the frying pan is only as big as a lid, so not that big. But being titanium, the <strong>whole set weighs just 6.2 ounces, or 175 grams</strong>.</li>

An <strong>inflatable camping pillow</strong> has a few advantages over a foam pillow, the biggest one being that an inflatable pillow can be deflated when not in use, and wont take up nearly as much room in your bag. Of course the one big thing that you have to worry about is popping your pillow, something that foam pillow users definitely do not have to worry about.
<h2>Inflatable Camping Pillow</h2>
What to look for when you are looking at inflatable camping pillows.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Padded</strong> - Some inflatable camping pillows are just an inflatable core and that is it, but there are others that use a bit of padding and softer outer material to give your head a bit more of a luxurious camping experience. The downside to these luxuries is that they add weight, but you should always put a good night of sleep ahead of weight savings.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - Most camping pillows come in the standard rectangular shape, but this isn't the only option available to you. There <!--more-->are a few shaped camping pillows out there that, while small, might give you a better sleep experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Inflatable Camping Pillow</h2>
A few of the best inflatable camping pillows out on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797662/exped-air-pillow\">Exped Air Pillow</a> - The Air Pillow is a great, basic inflatable camping pillow. It features a <strong>divot in one side</strong>, so that your neck can fit right in and you can get the best sleep possible. One side is also slightly thicker than the other, further adding to your comfort. The pillow <strong>weighs 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - Another basic inflatable pillow from Mont Bell. This is just a <strong>standard rectangular shape</strong> without any snazzy features. What does stand out about this pillow is the weight, which at <strong>2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>, is likely the <strong>lightest inflatable pillow you will find</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-fillo-pillow\">NEMO Equipment Inc. Fillo Pillow</a> - Another rectangular inflatable camping pillow, but this one has a few extras worth mentioning. The <strong>outer is micro brushed, so very soft</strong> and comfortable to sleep against. There is also a <strong>full inch of memory foam</strong> to provide a little extra cushion, and an elastic on the underside to secure some extra clothes or whatever else to the underside, to add even more padding. No word on how much it weighs, but it's definitely more than the other two listed.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Camping Pillows</h2>
While a camping pillow is a great luxury item to have along, when space matters it can be difficult to justify the space for it. Many campers and backpackers make do with folding up a few items of clothing, like a sweater or any other insulating layer, and laying their head on that at night. One big advantage of this technique is that you have warm clothes to wear in the morning.

If you want to make this set up a little more comfortable without adding a lot of bulk or weight to your backpack, a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719845/therm-a-rest-trekker-pillowcase\">microfiber pillow case</a> can be stuffed with whatever clothing you have on hand, which makes a great pillow."

You might not even end up needing the flashlight, but if you do need it, you better have it down there at the bottom of the bag. But for a light source, you're not just limited to a handheld flashlight. Something like a headlamp, for example, does the job of illuminating what you want illuminated, but keeps your hand free, so that you can interact with your environment without needing to put the flashlight down.
<h2>Hiking Flashlight</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing hiking flashlights.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - If you're going to carry a flashlight around with you, you might as well make it a small, lightweight flashlight. There are plenty of big, heavy flashlights out there that will illuminate the whole forest for you, but for most things, like finding something at the bottom of your bag, a much smaller, lightweight flashlight will do the trick.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> - Improvements in light sources, along with improvements in batteries, has led to many flashlights having tens, if not hundreds of hours of battery life. So <!--more-->if you plan correctly, there is no reason to take along extra batteries, as you should be able to get through a trip without needing a new battery.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Flashlight</h2>
A few of the very best flashlights to take hiking with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/632461/photon-micro-light-ii-led-light\">Photon Micro Light II LED Light</a> - If you just want <strong>something small to have at the bottom of your backpack</strong>, just in case, then the Micro is ideal. It's tiny, at just <strong>.17 ounces, or 5 grams</strong>, and will give you a total of <strong>120 hours of battery life</strong>. It only <strong>illuminates 1.5 meters</strong> in front of you, so you wont see much, but then for most things while hiking you don't need to see much farther than that.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ion-headlamp\">Black Diamond Ion Headlamp</a> - A headlamp is a fantastic alternative to a traditional flashlight. The Ion is a simple and lightweight version of a headlamp, at just <strong>1.3 ounces, or 30 grams</strong>, and will go <strong>15 hours on the low setting and 3 on high</strong>, so not especially long, but enough to get you through a night or two. The strap system is really simple, with no overhead strap, but it will at least stay on your head.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-amp-series-flashlight\">Princeton Tec Amp Series Flashlight</a> - If nothing but a <strong>traditional, hand held flashlight</strong> will do, the Tec Amp is a good choice. It comes in a <strong>few different sizes</strong>, the largest getting a total of <strong>160 hours of burn time, and weighs 7.5 ounces, or 212 grams</strong>. It's also weather resistant, and has a handy clip so you can use it hands free.</li>

Even for something like backpacking or camping, a bright headlamp can come in handy illuminating a wide area, for finding a suitable back country camp site after the sun has gone down. Whatever the case, the <strong>brightest LED headlamps</strong> give you plenty of light to work with to see whatever you need illuminated.
<h2>Brightest LED Headlamp</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for the brightest LED headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> - It should go without saying, but when you are looking for a bright LED headlamp, what you are looking for is the headlamp with the highest lumens output. Lumens is a measurement of brightness, and is the number you want <!--more-->to pay attention to to know just how bright your headlamp is going to be.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> - Another important number to pay attention to is battery life. A headlamp that blasts out high lumens but uses your entire battery up in just a few hours in the process isn't going to be of much use to you. Ideally, you want a headlamp that gives you a bright beam and also plenty of battery life at that setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Brightest LED Headlamp Reviews</h2>
A few of the best and brightest LED headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/icon-3-watt-led-headlamp\">Black Diamond Icon LED Headlamp</a> - If you want bright, but don't want to spend a whole lot to get it, the Icon is a good compromise. It will put out <strong>100 lumens</strong>, which gives you a <strong>100 meters of illumination</strong>, and will do that for <strong>145 hours</strong>. On low it will give you less lumens, but 165 hours of light. It <strong>weighs 4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>, which is respectably lightweight, and is a reasonable price compared to a lot of other ultra-bright headlamps.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-headlamp-200-lumens\">Princeton Tec Apex Headlamp</a> - A definite step up from the Icon above, the Apex puts out a <strong>full 200 lumens on high, which will illuminate 116 meters in front of you, and it will do that for 60 hours</strong>. On the lowest setting it goes a full 200 hours before you need to change the battery. It's also waterproof. The whole things <strong>weighs 9.8 ounces, or 279 grams</strong>, but if you want bright you have to expect to carry a little more weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - The Ultra is the kind of headlamp you go to if you absolutely must have the brightest LED headlamp around. It puts out a <strong>full 350 lumens on high</strong>, and has a <strong>beam distance of 120 meters at that setting</strong>. You only get<strong> 2 hours of battery life on high, however, and 17 hours on low</strong>. The good news is that the <strong>battery pack is rechargeable</strong>, so you wont be spending a fortune on new batteries. The bad news is that this monster of a headlamp costs a little over $400. It's bright, but you have to pay for that impressive brightness.</li>

Water bottles are the kind of thing that most people have lying around the house, but if you don't have a few good water bottles to take with you, or if you're interested in seeing what else is available, there are some great <strong>backpacking water bottles</strong> out there. You might not think that there would be much innovation that could be put in to something as simple as a water bottle, but you would definitely be wrong.
<h2>Backpacking Water Bottles</h2>
What to look for when you are shopping for backpacking water bottles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Water is already heavy enough, so there is no reason to add to all that weight by carrying around heavy water bottles too. If you have a preference for something like stainless steel, it can be difficult to avoiding adding a few ounces with the water bottle, but if you're open to a few more innovative options, you can save quite a bit of weight by shopping around for water bottles.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Enough</strong> - Water bottles come in all different sizes, and getting the right size is important. If you're backpacking over long distances, for instance, you might want a few different <!--more-->water bottles so that you can store some for longer distances between watering holes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Water Bottles</h2>
A few of the better backpacking water bottles that are worth looking at for your next backpacking trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/402049/nalgene-wide-mouth-loop-top-round-bottle-32-fl-oz\">Nalgene Wide-Mouth Bottle</a> - The Nalgene is a classic, and with good reason. It's <strong>tough and relatively lightweight</strong>. The wide mouth is also a definite plus for filling from streams or fitting on to the end of a filter. This particular version <strong>holds 32 ounces, or .95 liters, and weighs in at 3.5 ounces, or 99 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-bottle-12-40-oz\">Kleen Kanteen Stainless Steel Bottle</a> - If you don't like the idea of plastic, and prefer something like <strong>stainless steel</strong>, then the Kleen series of bottles are a great choice. They come in a <strong>number of sizes, ranging from 12 to 40 ounces</strong>. The <strong>12 ounce version weighs 4 ounces, or 113 grams, while the bigger 40 ounce version weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>, so definitely not as lightweight as the Nalgene, but you wont find any lightweight stainless steel bottles.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-cas0448\">Platypus Platy Plus Bottle</a> - This is a rather innovative water bottle that backpackers will likely appreciate. It's <strong>made of a pliable plastic</strong>, which you can fold or roll up when you're not using it. The main advantage of this is that your unused water bottles wont be taking up all kinds of space in your backpack. The other big advantage is that these <strong>weigh next to nothing, at just .8 ounces or 22 grams for the 1 liter version, and 1 ounce or 28 grams for the 2 liter version</strong>.</li>

Garmin is a well known name with GPS units in general, and they make many excellent GPS units designed specifically with hikers, campers and backpackers in mind. Garmin also makes hiking GPS units at a number of different price points, so there is something for everyone.
<h2>Garmin Hiking GPS</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing GPS units.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Feature Set</strong> - Even the most GPS units tend to have a few excellent features, like digital compasses and altimeters, that can really come in handy. But more expensive units will also have many excellent features, like higher resolution color screens and even access to satellite imagery, that you wont find on cheaper models.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> - One of the most important things to consider when reviewing GPS units is battery life. You can have<!--more--> all the greatest features in the world, but if you are constantly running out of batteries, and having to carry extras around with you everywhere you go, then it might almost be better to downgrade to something with a better battery life.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Garmin Hiking GPS</h2>
A few of the better Garmin hiking GPS units at a range of price points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-etrex-vista-h\">Garmin eTrex Vista H</a> - On the <strong>more basic</strong> side of things, you have the Vista from Garmin. It has a <strong>digital compass and a barometric altimeter</strong>, to give you basic information about your surroundings, and has a minimalist, <strong>black and white screen</strong> for finding your way. You get<strong> 24 megabytes of extra memory</strong> for custom maps, and an <strong>18 hour battery life</strong>. The unit <strong>weighs 5.3 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/garmin-gps/rino-130\">Garmin GPS Rino 130</a> - A step up from the Vista, the Rino 130 doesn't offer much of a significant improvement in terms of GPS capabilities, with just a <strong>black and white screen and the same 24 megabytes of extra memory</strong>. What it does do quite a bit better is tell you about what's around you. It has a <strong>built in weather radio that will automatically scan for the nearest NOAA weather station</strong>, so you can get up to date information on what conditions are going to be like. It averages <strong>14 hours of battery life, and weighs 7.6 ounces, or 236 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/825494/garmin-gpsmap-62stc-gps\">Garmin GPSMAP 62stc GPS</a> - At the high end, there is the 62stc. With this GPS unit you get a <strong>detailed, full color topographical</strong> map of your area. You also get a <strong>5 megapixel camera and 1.7 gigabytes of extra space</strong> for custom maps. With a subscription you can also <strong>download satellite imagery</strong> right to the device. You can expect the battery to last roughly <strong>15 hours</strong>, and the unit <strong>weighs 7.5 ounces, or 212 grams</strong>.</li>

Knowing when sunset will be, for instance, and whether you should make camp where you are or push on to the next site is important information to have. You might also want to know if you have enough time to get around headland before the tide comes in, or what your elevation or direction of travel is. A good camping watch can tell you all of this and more.
<h2>Camping Watches</h2>
Features to look for when you are reviewing camping watches to buy.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Compass</strong> - One useful feature to have on camping watches is a compass. A compass is the kind of thing it is often prudent to bring on an extended camping trip in the wilderness, but not something that is essential. So having a compass built in to your watch is an ideal solution to that problem.</li>
	<li><strong>Altimeter</strong> - Another useful bit of technology that you'll find on many camping watches is an altimeter, to tell <!--more-->you how high up you are. Again, your elevation is not essential information in most cases, but it can be useful in a number of different scenarios, particularly for navigation.</li>
	<li><strong>Nightlight</strong> - Any good camping watch should have a nightlight. When your outdoors and light sources aren't as convenient as they are indoors, a nightlight or backlight on your watch makes finding out the time simple, even at 3 or 4 in the morning.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778410/casio-pathfinder-paw1500-1v-multifunction-watch\">Casio Pathfinder PAW1500 Watch</a> - If you want the best, it doesn't get much better than the Pathfinder from Casio. For starters, it <strong>automatically receives atomic clock updates in the U.S. and a few other countries</strong>, so you can be sure you always have the right time. It's also <strong>powered with solar power</strong>, so as long as there is daylight, you will never run out of batteries. It also has an <strong>altimeter, thermometer, barometer and digital compass</strong>, so you will always know as much as possible about the world around you. Features like<strong> tide and moon tables</strong> help round out this excellent camping watch.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-vector-altimeter-watch\">Suunto Vector Altimeter Watch</a> - Another feature rich watch, this time from Suunto and at lower price point. You get an <strong>altimeter, thermometer, barometer and a digital compass</strong> too, but none of the more sophisticated extras of the Pathfinder above. But still, an excellent camping watch with all the features that most people will want.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/timex/expedition-trail-series-digital-compass-watch-full-size\">Timex Expedition Trail Series Watch</a> - If you're not looking for something overly complicated, this watch from Timex is likely ideal. It's <strong>digital, and comes with a digital compass</strong>, but that's where the extras end. This is a <strong>fairly basic unit</strong> built to tell you the time and not much else, and the price reflects that.</li>

The press method of making coffee is particularly easy to pull off in the outdoors, as there are several excellent <strong>camping coffee press</strong> devices available on the market. So if you like to press your coffee, or if you can come around to it, and cant do without a cup in the morning, even in the outdoors, you are in luck.
<h2>Camping Coffee Press</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for camping coffee presses.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - For some coffee in the morning is an absolute necessity, but for many others it's a luxury item, and you always want to try to keep the weight down on your luxury items. Just like a cup of coffee will allow you to enjoy the outdoors more, a lightweight backpack will also definitely improve your camping experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> - A press is a great coffee making device for camping because it easily integrates with a cup or a pot, so <!--more-->that the receptacle you use has more than one use, and only the press itself is used just for making coffee. Related to the point above, this helps to save weight, and also space in your backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Press</h2>
A few of the better camping coffee presses.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/760629/jetboil-coffee-press\">Jetboil Coffee Press</a> - This coffee press from Jetboil is <strong>meant to integrate with a Jetboil cooking system</strong>, so if you own cooking supplies from a manufacturer other than Jetboil, this likely is not the right coffee press for you. But for Jetboil owners it is ideal, as it's just the press, which integrates well with already existing Jetboil equipment. The press <strong>weighs 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - This is actually a <strong>titanium combination of press and pot</strong> from Snow Peak, which is ideal if you don't already have a pot. It will make no more than <strong>two cups of coffee</strong>, but does the job well, and weighs a total of <strong>6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-cafe-latte-set\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Latte Press</a> - This set from Snow Peak takes back country one step farther. You get the <strong>same basic press and pot described above</strong>, but you <strong>also get a milk foamer</strong>, to add that special something to your morning coffee. The whole thing <strong>weighs 11.2 ounces, which is 317 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternative Coffee Making Methods</h2>
If you're particularly concerned with going as lightweight as possible when camping, then you are definitely on the right track by using a press for making your coffee. But there are a few other lightweight coffee making options available, the best being the very simple <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">immersion filter from MSR</a>. It's a basic, 150 micron immersion filter, similar to those used for steeping tea (and it can be used for tea as easily as it is for coffee). But it's extremely lightweight, at just 1 ounce, or 28 grams, and also <strong>won an Editor's Choice Gold Award in 2009 from Backpacker magazine</strong>."

A good <strong>backpacking cup</strong>, for instance, is a nice piece of equipment to have for hot beverages in the morning or at the end of the day, and maybe even for cooking with. But not all backpacking cups are made equal, and despite the simplicity of a cup, there are actually quite a few options available when picking out a new backpacking cup.
<h2>Backpacking Cup</h2>
Features to look out for when you are reviewing backpacking Cups.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Handle</strong> - A handle is a useful thing to have on your backpacking cup, particularly if you like to enjoy hot beverages, like coffee or tea. To cut down on bulk, however, it helps if the handle is also foldable, so that you have a handle when you need one, and then you can get rid of the handle to help cut down on bulk when packing. You <!--more-->might also consider getting a double walled cup, which will help to both insulate the contents of the cup and also keep your hands from burning.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - As with most backpacking cookware and food receptacles, there are a number of material choices. Titanium is always going to be one of the best options, because it's both tough and light, and in the case of a backpacking cup, can be cooked with in a pinch. Stainless steel also performs well, though it weighs more than titanium.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Cup</h2>
A few of the very best backpacking cups currently on the market to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-single-wall-cup-600\">Snow Peak Titanium Single Wall Cup</a> - This is a great, basic backpacking cup from Snow Peak. It's <strong>titanium</strong>, for starters, so it weighs relatively little, at just <strong>2.8 ounces, or 79 grams</strong>. It also has a <strong>handle that folds down</strong>, so it will pack well, and finally it <strong>holds 21 ounces of liquid, or 620 milliliters</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/space-saver-cup\">Olicamp Space Saver Cup</a> - Another great backpacking cup, this one made of <strong>stainless steel</strong>. Being steel it weighs a bit more, though there is no weight listed for the cup. But the <strong>handle is collapsible</strong>, and the one stand out feature of this cup is that it <strong>fits snugly on the bottom of a 32 oz Nalgene bottle</strong>, or similar bottle, so you don't waste any space in the process of packing it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">Snow Peak Titanium Double-Wall Cup</a> - Another titanium cup from Snow Peak, though this one is <strong>double-walled</strong>, instead of the single-walled one above. It has the same <strong>folding handle</strong> as the one above, though it holds slightly less, at <strong>15.9 ounces, or 470 milliliters</strong>, and weighs slightly more due to the extra material, at <strong>4.2 ounces, or 119 grams</strong>. One thing to be aware of when using double walled cups is that they are not suitable for cooking with.</li>

And even in non-emergency situations, like a simple blister on a foot, a first aid kit can help alleviate the problem, and prevent it from becoming something worse. A <strong>first aid kit for camping</strong> doesn't have to be particularly big either, as long as it has the basics.
<h2>First Aid Kit - Camping</h2>
What to look for when buying a first aid kit for taking camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - Many items that you find inside a first aid kit will be sensitive to water. Bandages, for instance, will quickly become useless if exposed to enough water. And there is plenty of water in the outdoors. For that reason, it's important that you either buy a first aid kit that comes in a waterproof container, or else put your first aid <!--more-->kit in something waterproof. Something as simple as a ziplock bag will do.</li>
	<li><strong>Essential Items</strong> - There's nothing wrong with getting a small, lightweight first aid kit for taking camping, but you should make sure that it has essential items, such as bandages and supplies for cleaning a wound. For camping, items like moleskin are also a smart addition, as foot problems are one of the more common medical problems experienced by campers, hikers and backpackers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best First Aid Kit - Camping</h2>
A few of the better camping first aid kits to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-weekender-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Weekender First Aid Kit</a> - If you find yourself responsible for the first aid needs of a larger group, then you will need a larger first aid kit, which is what the Weekender is. It's <strong>suitable for 1-6 people for up to 7 days</strong>. It includes all the essentials that you would need, plus a few extras, like disposable thermometers and instruction booklets for a variety of different medical problems that will be handy for less experienced first aid practitioners. It <strong>weighs 1.6 pounds, or 737 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/718294/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-9-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical .9 First Aid Kit</a> - Another medical kit from Adventure Medical, this one designed with <strong>lightweight backpackers and campers</strong> in mind. It contains enough supplies for <strong>1-4 people for four days</strong>, yet only <strong>weighs 10.4 ounces, or 295 grams</strong>. It contains all the basics, and is also <strong>waterproof</strong>, which is extremely handy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-watertight-3-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical .3 First Aid Kit</a> - <strong>If you're only responsible for your own first aid needs</strong> and want something as lightweight as possible, this is an excellent choice. It contains just the basics, and a minimal amount of them, and comes in a <strong>plastic, resealable bag</strong>. The whole kit only <strong>weighs 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, making it an ideal choice for solo, lightweight backpackers and campers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Most Important Part</h2>
The most important part of a first aid kit for camping is the knowledge of how to use the items inside the first aid kit. Many kits come with helpful instruction manuals that cover the basics, and can be quite useful, but still, you should take it upon yourself to educate yourself on how to use a first aid kit. More specifically, you should look in to wilderness first aid training, which deals specifically with first aid techniques and procedures for those who find themselves in the outdoors."

Bears in particular are often drawn to campsites by cooking and food smells, and can be dangerous if encountered. Even worse, bears that manage to find food in campsites become habituated to it, and will seek out campsites in the future, looking for another easy meal. For this reason, it's a good idea to use a <strong>bear resistant canister</strong> when camping or backpacking in bear country.
<h2>Bear Resistant Canister</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for a bear resistant canister.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Bear canisters are heavy, in part because building a canister that will keep a bear out requires a lot of material. But despite that, there are some big differences in the weights of bear canisters, and if you are going to be carrying your bear canister for any appreciable distance, you will be less fatigued by a lightweight bear resistant canister.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Enough</strong> - Bear canisters also come<!--more--> in a few different sizes, and depending on how many of you there are and how many days you are going camping or backpacking for, you may want a certain size of bear canister.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Resistant Canister</h2>
There aren't too many bear resistant canisters to choose from, but there are a few of the better ones.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - When a bear gets a hold of a bear canister it will often drag the canister away in to the woods to try and get it open. And while your bear canister likely will not go too far, you may have a difficult time finding it in the morning. Which is why the <strong>bright yellow</strong> Counter Assault bear canister is a good option. It does, however,<strong> weigh 4.4 pounds, or 1.92 kilograms, and holds 11.7 liters</strong>, which is enough room for about <strong>7 days of food</strong>, but not a particularly impressive weight to capacity ratio.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/624081/garcia-bear-resistant-container\">Garcia Bear Resistant Container</a> - This bear canister from Garcia is slightly smaller, with just a <strong>10 liter capacity</strong>, but also weighs quite a bit less, at just <strong>2.75 pounds, or 1.24 kilograms</strong>. It's also black, so not the easiest bear canister to find in the morning, but even so, a good option as far as bear resistant canisters go.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\">Bear Vault BV500</a> - The BV500 is the best bear canister on a couple of different metrics, the most important being weight. With a weight of just <strong>2.56 pounds, or 1.16 kilograms, it's the lightest bear canister on this list. It also provides 11.5 liters of storage space</strong>, which is quite good, considering the weight. Best of all, however,<strong> it's clear, which means you can find food inside the bear canister</strong> without having to root around or dump the whole thing out. It also comes in a smaller size, called the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\">BV450</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camping or Backpacking in National Parks</h2>
Many people end up buying a bear resistant canister specifically because they are required in some parks where there are large bear populations. Park officials want to ensure that bears don't start associating campers and campsites with an easy meal, and bear canisters are a good way to do that.

Before buying a bear canister for use in a park, you should make sure that the bear canister you are buying is approved for use in the park. As of this writing, all of the above bear canisters are approved, but this may change without warning, if any of the bear canisters above are reported to have been penetrated by a bear, for instance."

But sometimes you will need some actual protection, which is where something like <strong>bear repellent spray</strong> comes in handy. Bear spray is much like pepper spray that is bought for self defense, the difference being that it is formulated for a bear's senses, and not a humans. If you get doused with bear repellent spray, however, you definitely will still feel the effects.
<h2>Bear Repellent Spray</h2>
The basic features that you should understand when buying bear repellent spray.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Distance</strong> - Some bear sprays will go farther than others. Bear spray shoots quite far, a lot farther than normal pepper spray, but still, you will have to wait until the bear is relatively close, and so you will likely want a spray that shoots as far as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Spray Time</strong> - The bigger your canister of bear repellent is, the more you will be able to spray. Remember that <!--more-->you might not hit the bear right away, and it might take more than a little spray to dissuade it, so the more you have at your disposal, the better.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Repellent Spray</h2>
The selection of bear repellent spray is slim, but here are a few good choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">Counter Assault Bear Repellent (230 grams)</a> - With this size of repellent you will be able to reach a distance of anywhere from <strong>12 to 30 feet</strong>, and you will have<strong> roughly 7 seconds</strong> of spray to work with.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Repellent (290 grams)</a> - This slightly larger can of spray is also slightly more powerful, going anywhere from <strong>12 to 32 feet</strong> in front of you, and will also spray for slightly longer, at <strong>about 9.2 seconds</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bear Repellent Accessories</h2>
One of the most critical aspects, when using bear repellent spray, is that you have <strong>quick, easy access to the can</strong>. Bear repellent spray that is in your backpack is not going to do you any good when a bear is charging at you. Even bear spray that it takes a few seconds to access is probably too far away when the time to use it comes.

There are a couple of different ways to solve this problem, but the easiest is by using a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">bear repellent holster</a>. That particular holster is made by Counter Assault, and is designed to work with both the 230 gram and the 290 gram sizes. It attaches to your belt and the bear spray is held in place by a single strap that is secured with velcro, so that you have easy access to the bear repellent when you need it."

In addition to the classic <strong>dome tent</strong> there are also many pyramid style tents, for example, that use just a single pole and stakes to create a shelter, and there are also many tarps that people use, in combination with trekking poles or similar poles, to fashion a shelter out of. But the dome tent is a definite classic, and if you're looking for a tent, there is plenty of options to choose from.
<h2>Dome Tent</h2>
A few features to look out for when shopping for a new dome tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - If you're going to be carrying your dome tent around in a backpack then you might as well make it as lightweight a tent as possible. There are plenty of heavy tents out there, but not nearly as many lightweight tents, so make sure you do your research on this point (over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">compare tents</a> page, for instance) and find a lightweight dome tent.</li>
	<li><strong>Season Appropriate</strong> - Depending on where and when you're going camping or backpacking, you may want a four <!--more-->season or three season tent. For areas where you will be experiencing high winds, especially, a four season tent is a good choice, as it wont collapse on you halfway through the night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Dome Tent</h2>
A few of the very best dome tents that are out there for you to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 Tent</a> - The entire Fly Creek line from Big Agnes was the <strong>2010 winner of the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. The two person version weighs a scant <strong>2.12 pounds, or 963 grams</strong>, and provides <strong>28 square feet of floor space</strong>. It's definitely a three season tent, but a very lightweight three season tent. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">1 person</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">3 person</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">4 person</a> version.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/copper-spur-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-seas\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL 2 Tent</a> - Another award winner from Big Agnes, the Copper Spur UL line <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It <strong>weighs 3.3 pounds, or 1.57 kilograms</strong>, and gives you <strong>29 square feet of floor space</strong> to work with. So obviously it's quite a bit heavier than the Fly Creek, but without much additional floor space. It's also cheaper than the Fly Creek, however, so that definitely factors in. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/copper-spur-ul-1-tent-1-person-3-seas\">1 person</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/copper-spur-ul-3-tent-3-person-3-seas\">3 person</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-copper-spur-4-tent\">4 person</a> version.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-2-meter-dome-tent-8-person-4-season\">The North Face 2-Meter Dome Tent</a> - If what you're looking for is a true, <strong>four season dome tent</strong>, then you would be hard pressed to do better than this dome tent from The North Face. The price is daunting, but you get a whole lot of tent for what you pay. It <strong>fits 8 people</strong>, and with <strong>2 meters of vertical space</strong> there is enough room for most people to stand up. You get a total of <strong>125 square feet of floor space</strong>, but thoughtful features like <strong>dual doors for ventilation, a chimney for cooking vapors to escape and a super durable floor for heavy traffic</strong> are what sets this dome tent apart.</li>

If you're going to expect a full day of backpacking out of your body after all, then you need to give it every opportunity to recharge, and that happens at night, while you're asleep. But if you're tossing and turning all night, uncomfortable, you will have a hard time giving 100% the next day on the trail. Which is why a good backpacking sleeping pad is essential.
<h2>Backpacking Sleeping Pad</h2>
What you need to look for when you are buying a new backpacking sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foam or Inflate</strong> - There are two main choices when it comes to the kind of padding you want from a sleeping pad, and those are foam and inflatable. Inflatable pads tend to be a bit more comfy, or at least less hard than foam, but also heavier and more prone to breaking. It's rather difficult to break a foam sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Rectangular or Mummy</strong> - Sleeping pads also come in a few different shapes. A mummy shaped sleeping pad, where the pad is widest at your shoulders and hips, and <!--more-->then tapered elsewhere, saves on weight, but if you like to toss and turn at night you might be better served by the extra room a rectangular sleeping pad provides.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> - R-value is a measurement of how warm a sleeping pad is, or how much heat will be reflected back at your while you sleep. What you need to know is that a higher R-value means a warmer sleeping pad, though you can read more about R-values over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">Sleeping Pad R-Values</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Sleeping Pad</h2>
A few of the very best sleeping pads for backpacking that you will find on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z Lite</a> - If you prefer foam over inflatable, then the Z Lite is an ideal choice. It uses an <strong>egg crate design</strong> to both increase comfort and cut down on weight, which is just <strong>14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>. It's also <strong>.75 inches thick</strong>, and packs up accordion style, so that you can easily attach it with a few exterior straps to just about anywhere on your backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped Downmat</a> - If you plan to be backpacking when the temperature is low you will need a backpacking sleeping pad with a high R-value, and with an <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, this is one of the warmest sleeping pads on market. It's <strong>inflatable</strong>, with a full 3.5 inches of air between you and the ground when fully pumped up, and it <strong>weighs just 2.24 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, which is very lightweight considering how warm it is. It actually achieves that high R-value with a layer of down built in to the top of it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - For summer camping with an inflatable sleeping pad, you wont do much better than the NeoAir. It <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and with good reason. It's <strong>rectangular, with 2.5 inches of height when fully inflated, yet it weighs just 14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>. The <strong>R-value of 2.5</strong> makes it well suited to three season camping, when staying warm isn't a chief concern.</li>

Many stoves allow you to use more than one fuel source, but there are many different fuel sources out there, and there are very few stoves that overlap more than two categories of fuel. Wood is a fairly unique camping stove fuel, in that it is waiting for you in the outdoors, and you don't have to carry it with you. A portable <strong>camping wood stove</strong> is a good choice, then, for those that like to go lightweight, and to reduce backpack bulk as much as possible.
<h2>Camping Wood Stove</h2>
Features to look for when you are considering camping wood stoves to buy.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - One of the big advantages of using wood as a fuel source is that you don't have to carry the wood with you, it's already waiting for you at your campsite. This is a big advantage over more conventional camping and backpacking stoves, and you <!--more-->shouldn't negate it by carrying a big, bulky, heavy wood camping stove.</li>
	<li><strong>Multiple Fuels</strong> - Wood may not always be an option. Some campsites and camping areas will forbid the use of wood as a fuel source for a variety of reasons, for instance, and in some places, there just isn't much wood to be found. If you have a second stove that runs on canisters or liquid fuels then you have options, but there are wood stoves that will also run on alcohol, for instance, for when wood isn't an option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Wood Stove</h2>
There aren't too many different camping wood stoves to choose from, but these are a few of the better ones.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove Set</a> - The DX is a simple yet elegant solution to your cooking needs. It has no moving parts, and will <strong>burn either solid fuels, like wood, or alcohol</strong>. And because it's titanium it <strong>weighs just 4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong> for the whole set. The stove also <strong>nests within itself</strong>, to reduce bulk when packing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829302/vargo-titanium-hexagon-backpacking-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - This wood stove from Vargo is the definition of simplicity. It's comprised of nothing more than a hexagon of titanium. The <strong>wood goes inside, your pot goes on top, and that's it</strong>. The conical shape helps to concentrate heat on the bottom of your pot, and the whole thing <strong>breaks down for easy packing</strong>. Your <strong>only fuel option here is wood</strong>, but at <strong>4.1 ounces, or 116 ounces</strong> and a price lower than the Evernew stove, it's a definite contender.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/junior-stove\">Littlebug Junior Stove</a> - The design of the Junior is somewhat similar to the DX above, in that it allows you to <strong>use both alcohol and solids such as wood</strong> as a fuel source. It's made of <strong>stainless steel</strong>, however, and weighs a bit more as a result, at <strong>5.1 ounces, or 144 grams</strong>. Stainless steel also costs less, however, so factor that in to your decision making.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Laws and Regulations</h2>
Depending on where you're camping and what time of year it is, you may not be allowed to make wood fires. Some places also restrict the use of wood fires, because it uses up a lot of wood from the natural environment. Make sure you know what the rules and regulations are regarding the use of wood as a fuel source before you head in to the outdoors."

A <strong>3 man tent</strong>, however, is a good choice because you can use a 3 man tent as a roomy 2 man tent, making it a versatile option. The jump between 3 man tents and 4 man tents, in terms of weight, is also usually quite big, so you're often better off with a couple two or three man tents, rather than one 4 or 5 man tent.
<h2>3 Man Tent</h2>
What to look for when you are shopping for a new 3 man tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - First and foremost, if you're going to be carrying your tent around in a backpack then you should do yourself a favor and get a lightweight 3 man tent, rather than a heavy one. That, or make sure 1 of the 2 other people sleeping in the tent ends<!--more--> up carrying it. There are plenty of very good lightweight 3 man tents, a few of them listed below.</li>
	<li><strong>Season Appropriate</strong> - Not all three man tents are made equal. Some are just fine for summer conditions, but would likely be damaged or inadequate for harsh, bad weather like in winter. Likewise, a good four season tent will weather a storm well, but will be overkill for a summer night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 3 Man Tent</h2>
A few of the very best 3 man tents currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/rainshadow2.html\">Tarptent Rainshadow 2</a> - If what you're looking for more than anything else is to save on weight, the Rainshadow is a great choice. It's made by a small tent manufacturer that specializes in lightweight tents, and at just <strong>2.5 pounds, or 1.13 kilograms</strong>, you wont find any 3 man tents lighter than this. It's a simple <strong>single walled design, with plenty of airflow</strong>. You have the option to <strong>use two trekking poles as the main supports for the tent</strong>, which is great if you use trekking poles. Otherwise, you can order a front pole from Tarptent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL3 Tent</a> - If you're looking for a more <strong>conventional dome tent</strong>, then the Fly Creek is an excellent choice. It <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and for good reason. It weighs just <strong>3.18 pounds, which is 1.45 kilograms</strong>, so not quite as lightweight as the Rainshadow above, but this is a two wall, freestanding tent, so you cant expect it to compare.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-ev-3-tent-3-person-4-season-mhw1048\">Mountain Hardwear EV 3 Tent</a> - For <strong>3 man camping in winter</strong>, you will need something a little more substantial than either of the tents above, and the EV 3 is a good choice. It's a <strong>single wall tent</strong>, but comes with <strong>2 doors and vents along the top</strong> to provide plenty of ventilation. It also has a low, sloping profile to help shed wind, and plenty of poles and guyline tie out spots to shed wind. It <strong>weighs a full 7.05 pounds, or 3.2 kilograms</strong>, so not nearly as lightweight as either of the two above, but then neither of the two above would survive the kind of windstorm that this tent would shrug off.</li>

Unlike with shoes, however, most of the differences between men’s and <strong>women’s snowshoes</strong> come down to weight. Snowshoes are designed to redistribute weight over a larger area, so that you don’t sink in to the snow. But since the average woman weighs less than the average man, women’s snowshoes can be smaller, as they have to distribute less weight. This is actually a very good thing, because the smaller and lighter your snowshoes are, the less weight there is on your feet, and the less energy you will expend from walking in the snow.
<h2>Women’s Snowshoes</h2>
A few features to look out for when shopping for new snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Purpose</strong> – There are actually several different kinds of snowshoes intended for several different things, and depending on what you plan to do in your snowshoes, you will be looking for a<!--more--> certain kind of snowshoe. Some people like to run in snowshoes, for instance, while others like to go hiking on trails. Others like to head in to powder with a backpack on, which requires a different kind of snowshoe.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Whatever kind of snowshoe you need, you should try to find a lightweight snowshoe. Every pound on your foot is equivalent to about 5 pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure, and some snowshoes can weigh several pounds. Remember too that that is in addition to your shoes or boots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Snowshoes</h2>
A select few of the best women’s snowshoes on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805235/atlas-923-elektra-snowshoes-starter-kit-womens\">Atlas 923 Elektra Snowshoes Starter Kit</a> - First up, a combination of <strong>snowshoes, snowshoe bag and trekking poles</strong>. These would make ideal hiking snowshoes for both on the trail and off the trail. The storage bag ensures that the cleats on your snowshoes wont rip any of your other hiking gear, and the trekking poles come in handy on uneven terrain. The snowshoes themselves are a standard combination of aluminum frame and nylon deck, and the <strong>recommended load is anywhere between 80 and 160 pounds</strong>. They <strong>weigh 3.25 pounds, or 1.47 kilograms</strong>, which is  fairly average weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoe</a> - Another pair of women's snowshoes, these better suited to back country with or without a backpack on. What makes these snowshoes ideal for back country travel is <strong>MSR's 360 degree traction system</strong>, which is cleats along the outer frame of the snowshoes, so that you have grip even when only a portion of your snowshoe is in contact with the ground. The Ascent snowshoes will also <strong>take a full 225 pounds</strong>, and with the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">attachable tails</a> you can add a few pounds to that, making them ideal for use with a heavy backpack. They <strong>weigh 3.4 pounds, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - For those that like to run in snowshoes, or even just those that stick to groomed trails, the Run snowshoes are a great choice. They're lightweight, at just <strong>2.7 pounds or 1.23 kilograms</strong>, which is ideal for running in. They're also relatively small, but still manage to take <strong>loads of anywhere from 75 to 190 pounds</strong>. What makes these snowshoes not well suited to anything off the trail is a <strong>minimal amount of cleats</strong>, which translates in to a minimal amount of grip on the snow and ice below you.</li>

The best <strong>camping sleeping bags</strong> both keep you warm and don’t add a lot of weight to your backpack, because if you have to carry that sleeping bag around with you to and from camp, you better hope that you got a lightweight camping sleeping bag, rather than a heavy one. Your sleeping bag is actually one item of the big three, which are the sleeping bag, tent and backpack, which are the three heaviest things most campers and backpackers take, and so one of the areas with the most potential weight savings.
<h2>Camping Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when you are looking at camping sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – One of the big contributing factors to the weight of a sleeping bag is its shape. A mummy shaped sleeping bag, which is tapered, uses a lot less fabric and insulation than a rectangular sleeping bag, and as a result, weighs less.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Material</strong> – Another important choice when it comes to a camping sleeping bag is the insulating material<!--more--> you choose. Down is lighter than synthetic, when compared based on temperature rating, but then down performs far poorer when wet, so it’s a bit of a trade off in that regard.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the better camping sleeping bags out right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - First, a rather excellent down sleeping bag designed for summer conditions, with a minimum <strong>temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>. What really stands out about the HighLite is its weight, which is a mere <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>. It gets there with a unique square baffle design and by using <strong>850+ fill down</strong>. For camping in warm summer conditions, something like the HighLite is ideal.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down #1</a> - Another excellent down sleeping bag, this one more of a <strong>3/4 season sleeping bag, with a temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>. Mont Bell is a Japanese manufacturer well known for their down garments, but they do a lot of excellent down products, including sleeping bags like this one. This particular one uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong> and has a <strong>water resistant nylon shell</strong>, so that the down doesn't get wet. It weighs a grand total of <strong>2.25 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, which is another excellent weight for the temperature rating.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762530/marmot-lithium-0-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Lithium +0</a> - If you're looking for more of a <strong>4 season camping sleeping bag</strong> that would be right at home in the snow, then the Lithium, which is good down to the <strong>0 temperature mark</strong>, is an excellent choice. It uses<strong> 850+ fill down</strong>, which is a very high quality, and uses features like a <strong>down filled draft collar and a drawcord on the face opening</strong> to help keep the heat in. It also uses a <strong>water resistant finish on the outer shell</strong>, so that the down should stay dry, even when everything else gets a little wet. The bag <strong>weighs 2.75 pounds, or 1.24 pounds</strong>.</li>

But there is another entirely viable option, and that is a <strong>backpacking umbrella</strong>. There are many drawbacks to an umbrella. They will not perform well when it is both windy and raining, for instance, and if you are someone who like to backpack with trekking poles, you will find yourself short one hand. But umbrellas also provide far better ventilation than a rain jacket, and do a better job of keeping your dry too.
<h2>Backpacking Umbrella</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for a backpacking umbrella.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - You don't want to just grab the umbrella from your closet to use as a backpacking umbrella, and the reason for that is the average umbrella is quite a bit heavier than the average <!--more-->umbrella designed for hiking with. Taking an umbrella over something like a rain jacket doesn't make a lot of sense, after all, if your umbrella weighs a lot.</li>
	<li><strong>Coverage</strong> - You want an umbrella that is big enough to protect you and your bag from the rain. But you don't want an umbrella that is too big, because a big umbrella will catch lots of wind, and will be more likely to become hung up on overhanging branches and the like.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Umbrella</h2>
There aren't too many backpacking umbrella choices out there, but these are some of the best available options.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/792725/rei-flyweight-siliconized-nylon-manual-umbrella\">REI Flyweight Siliconized Nylon Umbrella</a> - The Flyweight makes an ideal backpacking umbrella. It's extremely small when packed down, so that you can throw it in a jacket pocket or side backpack pocket for easy access when it starts raining. It also doesn't weigh too much, at <strong>7.1 ounces, or 201 grams</strong>, and is big enough, at <strong>36 inches of diameter</strong>, to give you and your backpack plenty of coverage.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-dome-trekking-umbrella\">GoLite Dome Trekking Umbrella</a> - The Dome is the biggest backpacking umbrella on the list, with an <strong>impressive 45 inch diameter</strong> when fully opened. That extra size has a cost, however, which is weight. At <strong>11 ounces, or 311 grams the Dome is the heaviest umbrella</strong> for backpacking on this list. But if you want something with a little more size, this is the ideal choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-trekking-umbrella\">U.L. Trekking Umbrella</a> - The <strong>lightest umbrella on this list, at 5.8 ounces, or 164 grams</strong>, is also the smallest, with a <strong>diameter of just 32 inches</strong>. You will have to be careful with how you hold it if you expect to stay fully dry, but on the plus side you wont be adding much extra weight to your backpack if you choose this umbrella.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternative Uses for Backpacking Umbrellas</h2>
Rain isn't the only thing that a backpacking umbrella is good for protecting you from. Many people also use umbrellas while backpacking to protect them from the sun. In this way, umbrellas make great dual use items for backpackers who expect to spend time in both the rain and the sun."

A good down jacket has a better warmth to weight ratio than any other insulating material out there, and those people who want the best tend to stick with a good down jacket. Of course women’s and men’s clothes are not the same, and there are some specific things about <strong>men’s down jackets</strong> that make them better suited for use by a man. The only real drawback associated with down is that it does not perform well when wet. It tends to clump, which drastically reduces its ability to insulate properly. And when that happens, you will get cold. But with that one caveat, down really is the best choice for staying warm outside.
<h2>Men’s Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you go shopping for a new men’s down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Down comes in a wide range of qualities, and while lower quality down will be less expensive, higher quality down gives you the same amount of warmth as lower quality <!--more-->down would, but for less weight. For backpackers and campers, this is an especially important point to pay attention to, as lighter gear means less weight and bulk in your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Remember that down should never be wet. If you have a waterproof layer to throw on over your down jacket, that’s great, but if not, you can always get a down jacket that is waterproof, or at least water resistant. That way, you get the insulation and you don’t have to worry as much about your down jacket getting wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Down Jacket</h2>
A few of the better men’s down jackets that are out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/770806/patagonia-down-sweater-mens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - The Down Sweater from Patagonia is a fairly standard down jacket. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, which is a good quality, and comes with a <strong>polyester outer that has a water repellent finish</strong>, so you don't have to worry about a little rain or showers. It comes in a few different colors, and is the kind of thing you could wear around town just as easily as you could on the trail. It <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ex-light-down-jacket-men-s\">Mont Bell EX Light Down Jacket</a> - This is a down jacket <strong>ideally suited to campers, hikers and backpackers</strong>. The <strong>outer is a DWR treated nylon</strong>, to keep light amounts of water out, but where this really stands out is the fill material, <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is the really good stuff. That, combined with a few excellent construction details get the weight of this men's down jacket down to just <strong>5.6 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>, which is ideal for stuffing in a backpack until you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you're getting a down jacket to stay warm, then there aren't too many options better than Canada Goose. This particular Canada Goose jacket uses <strong>625+ fill duck down, rather than goose down</strong>, and plenty of it to keep you warm just about anywhere. This jacket has been<strong> in use for 20 years by the National Science Foundation at Antarctica's McMurdo Station research facility</strong>. It has a whole list of features, including a <strong>down filled, fur lined hood</strong>, that sets it apart as a down jacket for cold conditions.</li>

A <strong>backpacking sleeping bag</strong> should be, first and foremost, a lightweight sleeping bag. You have to remember that when you’re backpacking you are carrying everything that you’re using on your back, sometimes for long stretches of time. Most backpackers resign themselves to the huge, 40 pound plus backpacks that seem to be common, but it doesn’t have to be like that. There are many backpackers that get the total weight of their backpack down below 10 pounds, minus the food and water, and they do that by getting lightweight versions of their gear, like a lightweight sleeping bag, for instance. You might end up spending a little more, but your legs and back will be thankful you made the upgrade after a long day of backpacking.
<h2>Backpacking Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you are shopping for a new backpacking Sleeping Bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – You should always pay attention to the kinds of temperatures that you will be backpacking in, and plan accordingly. Ideally, your sleeping bag would be the perfect <!--more-->temperature rating for the conditions you’re going in to, but it never quite works out like that. Better to go with a sleeping bag that is a little too warm, and then if it gets cold, you can throw on a few layers to stay toasty warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – You always have the choice of using synthetic insulation for your sleeping bag, but when it comes to backpacking a big consideration is weight, and a down sleeping bag is almost always going to be lighter than a synthetic sleeping bag with the same temperature rating. But even within the world of down sleeping bags, higher quality down gives more insulating power than lower quality stuff, meaning you save on weight in the end.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Sleeping Bag</h2>
The very best backpacking sleeping bags, across a range of temperature ratings.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite Sleeping Bag</a> - Starting at the warmer end of the spectrum, there is the HighLite, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>. It's an ideal temperature rating for <strong>summer camping or backpacking</strong>, but probably not any other season. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is a very high quality of down, and the medium weighs exactly <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>. A great sleeping bag and a great weight for summer backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Marmot Plasma +30 Sleeping Bag</a> - With a slightly warmer <strong>minimum temperature of 30 degrees</strong>, the Plasma is more of a <strong>3 season sleeping bag</strong>, provided the falls and springs in your area aren't especially cold. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, in part because of things like <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is the really high quality stuff. The lightweight, high quality down is offset by a few extra features, like a draft collar, so that the weight balances out at <strong>1.38 pounds, or 630 grams</strong>, which is lightweight, but not amazingly so.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral #1 Sleeping Bag</a> - Another sleeping bag, this one with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, making it ideal for cooler summers, spring, fall and even mild winter temperatures. The outer material is <strong>nylon with  DWR treatment, to help protect the 800+ fill down from moisture</strong>. One thing that stands out about Mont Bell's sleeping bags is their <strong>unique, coiled construction technique</strong>, which helps to add a bit of warmth without adding weight. The bag <strong>weighs 2.25 pounds, which is 1020 grams</strong>.</li>

A one man tent is a must have for any solo backpacking or camping, but even when you’re going with other people, it can be a useful thing to have. If there is an odd number of people compared to the amount of space available in tents, then you always have the option of bringing along your own tent to help even the numbers out. A one man tent also gives you the opportunity to buy a lightweight tent, and save yourself from having to carry around a big, heavy tent that someone else was foolish enough to buy. And finally, with a one person tent you don’t have to listen to someone else snoring or moving around all night, which is never a fun thing to go through in a small little camping or backpacking tent.
<h2>One Man Tent</h2>
Features to be on the lookout for when reviewing one man tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re going to be carrying your one man tent, you should be putting some research in to the varying weights of tents on the market. One man tents will be small, and so lightweight, but even within the one man tents, there is quite a lot of variation between the weights of different tents, based on materials and designs.</li>
	<li><strong>Seasons</strong> – Different tents are intended for different weather conditions. Many three season tents are fine for good weather camping, but would suffer in a <!--more-->wind storm. Likewise, a four season tent would withstand a windstorm just fine, but would be overkill, and unnecessarily heavy in summer conditions.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best One Man Tent</h2>
A few of the better one man tents currently out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-elite-tent-1-p-3-season\">Terra Nova Laser Photon</a> - Terra Nova is not as well known on North America as they are in their home base of the UK, but they make some excellent camping and backpacking products, including a few one man tents. This particular tent is a <strong>two walled design, intended for 3 season use</strong>. What really stands out about the Laser Photon, however, is the <strong>weight, which is just 1.47 pounds, or 670 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1</a> - Another excellent solo tent, and this one the <strong>winner of the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It's another <strong>3 season, two wall design</strong>, though it weighs a bit more, at <strong>1.87 pounds, or 850 grams</strong>. This increase in weight, however, is offset in a large decrease in price from the more expensive Laser Photon above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is something a little different. You can actually use a <strong>trekking pole, if you use them, as the roof support</strong>, though you can also order a pole with the tent if you don't use trekking poles. It's also a <strong>single wall design, but with plenty of ventilation</strong> so you don't end up with a wet interior in the morning. What all that adds up to is another extremely lightweight one man tent, at just <strong>1.53 pounds, or 696 grams</strong>.</li>

A <strong>sleeping bag pad</strong> is not actually a required item, it’s not like you will be in danger if you forget it at home, but without it you probably wont get much sleep either. And that really is the metric that you should be judging a sleeping bag pad on, the comfort it provides. If a sleeping bag pad does not let you get a full night of sleep, then you have gotten the wrong sleeping pad, and you should probably find one that lets you sleep like a baby.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Pads</h2>
Features to try and find on a new sleeping bag pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – One of the most important decisions you need to make when choosing a sleeping bag pad is the shape of your pad. Mummy shaped pads are great for those that don’t move around much when they’re asleep, but those that like to toss and turn might be better served by the extra room of a rectangular sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> – Sleeping bag pads come in two different padding types, those being inflatable and foam. Foam tends to be a little harder to sleep on, unless you get some<!--more--> big, thick foam. The drawback of inflatable pads is that they’re much easier to damage, but then they tend to be a bit more comfortable too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Pads</h2>
Some of the better sleeping bag pads on the market at the moment.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is quite likely the <strong>most popular sleeping bag pad</strong> currently being sold. It's <strong>inflatable and rectangular</strong>, but has an extremely low weight of just <strong>14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>, making it an equally popular choice for the weight conscious and the casual campers. It has an <strong>R-value of 2.5</strong>, so while it's not well suited to winter camping it's ideal for summer conditions. If you go off of popularity and reviews, this is the best possible choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-clearview-air-pad-mummy\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - This is a <strong>mummy shaped inflatable option</strong> from Big Agnes. It's a relatively lightweight option, at just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, but what really stands out about the Clearview is the price, which is quite a bit less than the comparable NeoAir above. If you want a <strong>lightweight, yet price conscious choice</strong>, the Clearview is ideal.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/z-lite-sleep-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z-Lite</a> - While inflatable sleeping bag pads have a lot going for them, foam is still a great option for a number of reasons. This particular pad comes with a <strong>softer foam on top, for comfort, and a denser foam on the bottom</strong>, for support. It's<strong> rectangular, and folds up accordian style</strong> for easy storage on the outside of your backpack. It also has an egg crate design, which definitely increases comfort. It's <strong>.75 inches thick, weighs 14 ounces, or 396 grams and has an R-value of 2.2</strong>. And being foam, it's the <strong>cheapest sleeping bag pad on this list of pads</strong>.</li>

But they’re also long and a little cumbersome, and when you’re not using them they have a tendency to get in the way. Which is why you need <strong>compact trekking poles</strong>. Fortunately, most trekking poles are not a fixed length, and telescope down to a more manageable size. There are even some trekking poles that break apart and fold down, which makes them ideal for throwing in a backpack or strapping on to the outside of one.
<h2>Compact Trekking Poles</h2>
Features to find on a new set of compact trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Telescoping or Folding</strong> – As alluded to above, there are many excellent trekking poles that telescope down to a very compact size. There are also, however, a few trekking poles that fold down, and are a fixed length when assembled. If you prefer a lighter trekking pole then folding, fixed length poles are a better choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Regardless of how compact your trekking poles are, the main choice you have when choosing which pair to get is the material. Aluminum is heavy and cheap, while carbon fiber <!--more-->is lightweight, but more expensive and more prone to breaking in certain conditions, such as when it’s cold.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Compact Trekking Poles</h2>
A few of the better compact trekking poles to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798297/black-diamond-trail-shock-compact-trekking-poles-pair\">Black Diamond Trail Shock Compact Trekking Poles</a> - This particular pair of trekking poles from Black Diamond is ideal for those looking for something <strong>compact and adjustable</strong>. Three sections, along with a reduced overall length makes these trekking poles able to <strong>telescope down to a mere 25 inches</strong>. They're also <strong>shock absorbing, and aluminum</strong>, so they do weigh a bit more, at <strong>1.24 pounds, or 564 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/summit-cor-tec-antishock-trekking-poles\">Leki Summit Cor-Tec Antishock Trekking Poles</a> - Another telescoping pair of trekking poles, this time from Leki. These are also <strong>shock absorbing</strong>, but only collapse down to a <strong>minimum length of 28 inches</strong>, which is slightly longer than the Black Diamonds above. They're <strong>aluminum</strong>, so like the Black Diamonds they're a bit heavier, at <strong>1.11 pounds, or 504 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> - These are actually a <strong>fixed length</strong> pair of trekking poles, meaning that you have to order the right length for you, because that's the length you're stuck with. The benefit, however, is that the fixed length, along with these being <strong>carbon fiber</strong> means these weigh just <strong>9.2 ounces, or 260 grams</strong>, which is quite a bit less than the other two pairs above. They also <strong>fold down to a length of just 15.6 inches</strong>, which is also quite a bit smaller than the other two pairs.</li>

But there are actually a few other choices that are available to backpackers, one of the more interesting ones being wood. A <strong>backpacking wood stove</strong> is certainly a lightweight option, the main reason being that you don’t have to carry your fuel with you, because it’s waiting for you at camp. Many backpacking wood stoves are also capable of using other fuel sources, making them an option even when wood isn’t an option.
<h2>Backpacking Wood Stove</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a backpacking wood stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Alternatives</strong> – If you’re backpacking in an area without any wood at hand, or if you find yourself in an area where wood fires are banned, then you need another fuel option. Many backpacking wood stoves will accept other solid fuels, such as esbit tablets, or even alcohol, giving you options when wood isn’t an option.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – The big advantage that wood backpacking stove has over other stoves is that you don’t have to carry any fuel, making a wood stove a lightweight option. You<!--more--> shouldn’t negate this advantage, then, by carrying around a big, heavy backpacking wood stove.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Wood Stove</h2>
There aren't too many camping wood stoves out there, but these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829302/vargo-titanium-hexagon-backpacking-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - The Hexagon is a straight wood stove that <strong>isn't suited for any fuel alternatives</strong>. It's just a simple hexagon of titanium, where the wood goes inside and the pot stands on top of the hexagon. The whole thing is <strong>tapered, so it directs and concentrates heat on the bottom of your pot</strong>, which is a great design feature. it also <strong>breaks down flat, for easy packing</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 4.1 ounces, which is 116 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/junior-stove\">Littlebug Junior Stove</a> - This is a wood stove that will <strong>also do alcohol</strong>, for when wood isn't an option. It's a small and compact stove, but because it's made from <strong>stainless steel it weighs a bit more, at 5.1 ounces, or 144 grams</strong>. But stainless steel also costs less, so if you're looking for a stove that gives you options and doesn't cost too much, this is a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove Set</a> - This is a design fairly similar to the Littlebug stove above, the big difference being that this is a titanium stove, so it weighs less, at <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>. Like the Littlebug it will <strong>burn either solid fuels like wood or alcohol</strong>, so you have options. It also <strong>nests within itself</strong>, which makes fitting it in your backpack that much easier. But being titanium, it does cost a bit more than the stainless steel Junior above.</li>

Fortunately, <strong>water filters for camping</strong> or any other outdoor activity make it easy to turn water that would make you sick in to water that wont do anything except hydrate you. You have a few different water filter options available to you, but they all filter water by passing that water through a physical filter, which gets rid of and neutralizes all the bad stuff lurking in that water.
<h2>Water Filters for Camping</h2>
Features to look for on a water filter for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pump or Gravity</strong> – A filter works on the principle of pushing water through a physical filter, and while most filters have you do the work of forcing the water through, by making you pump, there are some filters out there that let gravity do the work, so that you can come back after a few minutes to clean water, without having to do any of the hard work of pumping. Not for everyone, but an option to be aware of.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter Life</strong> – Just about all filters have a shelf life, and will need to be replaced at some point. But many filters will last a lot longer than others, and <!--more-->so you should definitely pay attention to how much water a filter can handle before it needs to be replaced. Upkeep can get expensive, after all, if you do a lot of camping and backpacking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Filters for Camping</h2>
A few of the more impressive water filters for camping that you can choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695265/msr-miniworks-ex-water-filter\">MSR MiniWorks EX Water Filter</a> - First, a very popular water filter for camping from MSR. First and foremost, you get <strong>2,000 liters of water before you need to replace anything</strong>, which is a relatively good amount. The output attaches easily to MSR's Dromedary bags or Nalgene water bottles with ease, though just about anything else should attach as well. Where this filter loses points, however, is speed, at only <strong>.83 liters per minute, and weight, at at a relatively high 14.6 ounces, or 416 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-works-filter\">Platypus Gravity Works Filter</a> - As mentioned above, pumping is not the only way to get your water through your filter. This filter uses two bags, one for the dirty water and one for the clean, with a tube attaching the two and a filter inline on the tube. You hang the dirty water bag above the clean water bag, and gravity does the rest. The system works surprisingly fast, at <strong>1.75 liters per minute, and will do 1501 liters before the filter needs to be replaced</strong>. The whole system also only <strong>weighs 10.75 ounces, or 304 grams</strong>, which is respectably lightweight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/katadyn-hiker-water-microfilter\">Katadyn Hiker Water Microfilter</a> - Another very popular pump filter, this time from Katadyn. It comes with two different attachments, one for Nalgene bottles and one for hydration packs. It weighs <strong>10.9 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>, which you'll notice is quite a bit lighter than the comparable MSR filter above. The downside is that you only get <strong>750 liters of water before something needs to be replaced</strong>, which is less than half of the MSR. It will also do <strong>1 liter of water per minute</strong>, which isn't too much different from the MSR.</li>

Without one you’re not likely to have a very good time in the outdoors. The <strong>best camping backpack</strong> has a few things going for it, the most important being that it’s big enough to carry everything. Many campers make the mistake of buying a backpack first, but it’s far smarter to buy everything else, and then buy a backpack that is just big enough to carry it all, without forgetting about food and water.
<h2>Best Camping Backpack</h2>
A few things to watch for when shopping for a new camping backpack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – First and foremost, your camping backpack needs to be big enough to carry everything you plan to big. As pointed out above, you need to include everything in this calculation, including food and water. The amount of food and water you take will vary quite a bit, depending on the conditions you go camping in and the length of the camping trip.</li>
	<li><strong>Frame</strong> – If you manage to get the weight and bulk of your camping gear down far enough you will be able to get a smaller, lighter <!--more-->backpack, and you may even be able to get a backpack without a frame. If the total weight of your backpack is going to be below 25 pounds or so, then a frameless backpack is a definite option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Backpack Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the best camping backpacks across a range of capacities.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam Backpack</a> - On the smaller side of things is the Jam, with a <strong>capacity of 50 liters</strong>. It's definitely a lightweight backpack intended for either lightweight backpackers who don't carry a lot or else regular backpackers who plan on doing nothing longer than a weekend trip. It lacks a frame, but does have a few essential features, like a <strong>hydration bladder pouch and pockets on the hip belt</strong> that campers will definitely appreciate. Campers will also appreciate the weight of just <strong>1.73 pounds, or 788 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - ULA Equipment is another company that makes products with lightweight backpackers in mind, though with a <strong>capacity of 68 liters</strong>, even backpackers that like to take a few luxuries should have plenty of room. The Circuit also has a <strong>carbon fiber frame, hip belt pockets and a simple, roll top closure</strong> that all help to save on weight while maximizing usability. Thoughtful features like a <strong>mesh exterior pocket where wet clothes can dry</strong> out help to make this an excellent camping backpack. And with a weight of just <strong>2.25 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, it's an extremely lightweight option too. It's also <strong>unisex, with several different length and hip belt options</strong> available for various body sizes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/764214/osprey-argon-85-pack\">Osprey Argon 85 Pack</a> - If you're looking for something big, with just about every feature you could hope to find on a backpack, the Argon is ideal. A <strong>frame, plus a well ventilated back panel</strong> make carrying heavy loads relatively comfortable. Besides being accessible through the top opening the main compartment is <strong>also accessible via side zippers, and there's a sleeping bag compartment</strong> on the bottom of the backpack too. There's also plenty of exterior pockets, and the top lid is removable. But at <strong>6 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.92 kilograms</strong>, the Argon certainly isn't going to win any weight contests. There's also a similar <strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/764211/osprey-xenon-85-pack-womens\">women's version</a></strong> available.</li>

You should know that there are plenty of options available when buying a camping sleeping mat, but the one thing that really matters is your sleep. If you cant get a full night of sleep, the sleeping mat you’ve chosen is not the right one for you. Keep that in mind when reviewing sleeping mats.
<h2>Camping Sleeping Mats</h2>
What to look for when looking for a camping sleeping mat.
<ul>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – One of the more important variables when it comes to camping sleeping mats that many people aren’t aware of is R-value. Depending on how well insulated your sleeping mat is, more or less of your body heat will be reflected back at you while you sleep. In cold conditions, for example, it can be extremely useful to have a sleeping mat with a high R-value that will reflect back a lot of heat.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Sleeping mats come in all different shapes and sizes, and you want to make sure to get the one most comfortable for you. A rectangular sleeping mat, for<!--more--> instance, is ideally suited to those that move around a lot while they sleep, while a mummy shape is better for those that stay quite still while sleeping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Sleeping Mats</h2>
Some of the very best camping sleeping mats to choose from for your next adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - First, what is very likely the <strong>most popular sleeping pad</strong> on the market. It's <strong>rectangular and inflatable</strong>, but it would be a mistake to assume that that means it's heavy, because at <strong>14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>, it's relatively lightweight. It also <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a quality product. The <strong>R-value is 2.5</strong>, which wont keep you very warm in the winter, but is more than suitable for the other 3 seasons of the year.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped Downmat 9</a> - For the fourth season of the year, winter, you need a sleeping bag with a high R-Value, and with an <strong>R-value of 8, this is one of the warmest sleeping mats</strong> currently on the market. What separates it out from the rest of the winter sleeping mats is its use of a <strong>layer of down to achieve both a high R-value and a low weight, of just 2.2 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, which compares extremely well with other winter sleeping mats. It's also <strong>rectangular and inflatable</strong>, with a plush thickness of 3.5 inches.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - If what you want is something cheap and basic, then the Clearview is an excellent choice. It comes in either a <strong>mummy shape or rectangular shape, and several different lengths</strong>. And despite the low price the weight is also very low, being just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams for the medium mummy</strong> shaped sleeping mat. The <strong>only real drawback here is an R-value of 1</strong>, which is quite low and will provide little to no warmth.</li>

Several smaller tents can end up being a lighter option, because bigger tents tend to require more and better poles, to support all that extra tent. But if what you need is something like an <strong>8 man tent</strong>, then there are certainly plenty of options out there for you. Just be sure that you get the options that you need to keep everyone comfortable, and that you don’t end up getting stuck carrying the tent.
<h2>8 Man Tent</h2>
Things to watch for when shopping for a new 8 man tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Doors</strong> – When you get 8 people inside a tent, midnight bathroom breaks and different wake up and bed times are an inevitability. Rather than having people crawling over each other to get to the one door, it makes things a lot easier if there are two doors. This adds to the weight of the tent, of course, but this is one case where convenience trumps weight considerations.</li>
	<li><strong>Floor Space</strong> – Make sure to compare floor space for several different tents. Manufacturers will calculate <!--more-->how much space one person needs a little differently, and this can become amplified when multiplying by 8. Also account for gear space, if you will be bringing much gear inside the tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 8 Man Tent</h2>
A few of the very best 8 man tents that you can choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810168/rei-kingdom-8-tent-2012\">REI Kingdom</a> - First, the <strong>cheapest tent on the list</strong>, this is actually the lightest tent on the list, at <strong>19 pounds 14 ounces, or 9.02 kilograms</strong>. Not a tent that you would want to carry very far in a backpack, but if you had to, it is the lightest of the three here. It comes with a total of <strong>104 square feet of floor space</strong> in a convenient rectangular shape, for easy layout of sleeping bags. It also comes with a <strong>divider to turn it in to two separate rooms</strong>, and each room has a door, so that people don't disturb each other too much at night. It's definitely a three season tent, not intended for winter use, but besides that it's a great choice for 8 people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flying-diamond-8-tent-8-person-4-seas\">Big Agnes Flying Diamond</a> - This is more of a four season option from Big Agnes. It can be <strong>separated in to a smaller and larger section with a partition wall</strong>, so that you have sort of a tented back area, ideal for storing gear, for instance. But each section does have a door of it's own, so it would be feasible for people to sleep in either section. And with <strong>112 square feet of floor space</strong>, there is definitely enough room for 8. But at <strong>22 pounds 6 ounces, or 10.14 kilograms</strong>, this is also not a tent you would want to carry very far.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-dome-8-tent-8-person-4-season\">The North Face Dome</a> - The Dome is a <strong>true four season, 8 person tent</strong>. It has a total of 10 poles, and the bottom of the fly has reinforced snow and wind shields, so that the <strong>fly can actually be pitched by itself</strong> if you're keen to save on weight. And you may want to save on weight, because at <strong>57 pounds 11 ounces, or 26.16 kilograms</strong> this is not a tent you want to be stuck carrying. Besides the optional floor this thing also has <strong>three huge doors</strong>, making it a viable option as a cooking tent or gathering area, and a versatile option for those spending long periods of time on a mountain. But with <strong>128 square feet of floor space</strong>, you can easily sleep 8.</li>

Importantly, you should know that a 2 person sleeping bag does not actually help save weight. Two lightweight sleeping bags will weigh less, in total, than one 2 person sleeping bag. So don’t get a 2 person sleeping bag if your goal is to save weight. Definitely do get a 2 person sleeping bag if your goal is to cuddle up and get close to another person. One advantage of a 2 person sleeping bag is that it may very well help save on space inside the tent, and you could likely get by with a large one man tent when using a 2 person sleeping bag.
<h2>2 Person Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for a 2 person sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tapered</strong> – Most 2 person sleeping bags come in a rectangular shape, but there are a few tapered 2 person sleeping bags out there, which are reminiscent of a mummy shaped one person sleeping bag. Tapered <!--more-->uses less material, which means those sleeping bags both weigh less and contain less dead space that needs to be heated with your body heat.</li>
	<li><strong>Down vs Synthetic</strong> – Insulating material is the big choice you have to think about when it comes to a sleeping bag. Synthetic insulation performs well when you get it wet, but otherwise down is the winner, with a better warmth to weight ratio. If you’re ever going to have to pack your sleeping bag around, down is the better choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 2 Person Sleeping Bag</h2>
There aren't a whole lot of 2 person sleeping bags out there, but these are some of the best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/king-solomon-15-double-bag-650-down\">Big Agnes Solomon 15</a> - First up, a down sleeping bag made with <strong>600+ fill down</strong>, which is on the lower end of the scale, when it comes to down quality. Still, most 2 person sleeping bags are synthetic, so this is a step up that helps to save on weight. Down also compresses a lot better, so this is a sleeping bag that would fit well in a backpack. Beyond that it has a <strong>separate zipper for each sleeper and a slight taper</strong>, though not much. It has a <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees and weighs 5 pounds 3 ounces</strong>, or 2.35 kilograms, making it the lightest 2 person sleeping bag on this list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778962/the-north-face-twin-peaks-20-sleeping-bag-double-wide-long\">The North Face Twin Peaks 20</a> - Another 2 person sleeping bag, this one with <strong>synthetic insulation rather than down</strong>. The synthetic insulation adds weight, but this bag also has a <strong>definite taper,</strong> which helps to save on weight, the whole thing coming out at <strong>5 pounds 13 ounces, or 2.64 kilograms</strong>, which is, you'll notice, heavier than the warmer Solomon 15 above, as this sleeping bag is only good <strong>down to 20 degrees</strong>. Still, another viable, and definitely cheaper, choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-dream-island-sleeping-bag-15-degree-synthetic\">Big Agnes Dream Island</a> - Another synthetic sleeping bag, this one good down to 15 degrees, like the Solomon. Unlike the Solomon, this <strong>weighs a big 9 pounds 5 ounces, or 4.22 kilograms</strong>, which is close to double the weight of the Solomon. But, it's also about half the price of the Solomon, so you can see where the price difference is. A good choice for car camping, but not much else.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Saving Weight</h2>
A 2 person sleeping bag is a great way to snuggle up at night, but they're not a good way to save on weight, despite what you might think. This isn't so much that the idea isn't a good one, it's just that there aren't many 2 person sleeping bags out there, and the few that are being made are not being made with serious campers or backpackers in mind. <strong>So a great way to snuggle, but if you're looking for a lightweight option, this isn't it.</strong>

Your two main choices in this regard and carbon fiber and aluminum. The main advantage of <strong>carbon fiber trekking poles</strong> is that they weigh less than aluminum. Carbon fiber trekking poles also tend to cost more, however, and carbon fiber also has a tendency to break easier than aluminum in certain conditions, such as when the temperature dips down.
<h2>Carbon Fiber Trekking Poles</h2>
What to try and find on a new set of carbon fiber trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fixed or Adjustable</strong> – Most trekking poles are adjustable, so that you can find the ideal length for you. There are a few, however, that come in a fixed length. The advantage of a fixed length carbon fiber trekking pole is that they tend to weigh the least of any trekking pole out there, making them an excellent option for lightweight backpackers.</li>
	<li><strong>Shock Absorbing</strong> – One option fairly common to find on trekking poles is shock absorption. Banging trekking poles against the hard ground all day can lead to<!--more--> a jarred feeling in the hands and arms. Shock absorption helps to negate this by absorbing some of the impact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Carbon Fiber Trekking Poles</h2>
A selection of the best carbon fiber trekking poles, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/contour-elliptical-carbon-trekking-poles\">Black Diamond Contour Elliptical Carbon</a> - As the name suggests these are an elliptical shape, rather than round, which helps to add strength. They're also an <strong>adjustable length</strong>, with three sections and the sections locks are quick and easy to use. They also have <strong>grip extending down below the handle, for steep descents</strong>. About the only area where these fall short is in the weight department. <strong>At 1 pound 3 ounces, or 536 grams, they're an especially heavy pair of carbon fiber trekking poles</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/leki-carbonlite-aergon-xl-antishock-trekking-poles-1-pair\">Leki Carbonlite Aergon XL Antishock</a> - Another pair of carbon fiber trekking poles, this time from Leki. Besides three sections and easy to use locks for an adjustable length, these also have <strong>anti-shock built in</strong>, to absorb some of the impact of thousands of strikes on the ground over the course of a hike. The pair <strong>weighs 13.2 ounces, or 376 grams</strong>, which is middle of the road as far as carbon trekking pole weights go.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813391/black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole</a> - At the lightweight end of the spectrum are the Ultra Distance Z-Poles. They <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and really are a fantastic pair of trekking poles. They're <strong>fixed length</strong>, so you need to order the right size, as you're stuck with that particular length. The payoff of being fixed length is that they weigh quite a bit less, at <strong>just 9.5 ounces, or 270 grams</strong>. They also <strong>fold down, much like tent poles do</strong>, so you don't have to worry about trying to pack around fixed length trekking poles.</li>

The main thing that separates a <strong>3 season sleeping bag</strong> from a 4 season sleeping bag is the temperature rating. A sleeping bag good down to 30 degrees, for instance, is just not suitable for a winter camping trip. But then a winter sleeping bag wouldn’t be of much use in summer either.
<h2>3 Season Sleeping Bag</h2>
Things to watch for when reviewing 3 season sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – If you’re going to be carrying your 3 season sleeping bag in a backpack, then you likely want to make sure to get a lightweight sleeping bag. One of the main advantages of 3 season camping is that the gear weighs less than four season camping gear. So look for down sleeping bags, as down weighs less than synthetic, and mummy shaped, as opposed to rectangular sleeping bags.</li>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – Depending on the temperatures in your area and the months you plan to go camping in, the temperature rating needed will vary. Try <!--more-->to get a sleeping bag that is close to the minimum temperature that you expect to be out in. You can add a few degrees to a sleeping bag with a sleeping bag liner or a few extra layers of clothing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 3 Season Sleeping Bag</h2>
A few of the best 3 season sleeping bags that you could choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731789/marmot-arroyo-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Arroyo +30</a> - At the warmer side of things, with a <strong>temperature rating of 30 degrees</strong> is the Arroyo. It uses high quality <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and a few extra features, like a <strong>down filled draft collar and a drawcord</strong> on the face opening, help to keep you warm. The whole thing weighs a total of <strong>27 ounces, which is 760 grams</strong>, which is definitely on the lightweight side of things when it compared to other 30 degree sleeping bags.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - Terra Nova is a lesser known UK manufacturer that makes some wonderful, lightweight backpacking gear, including sleeping bags. The Laser 600 has a <strong>temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong>, making it suitable for a wide variety of conditions. Best of all, it uses the very <strong>high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which helps it achieve a very respectable <strong>weight of 22.2 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>, perfect for lightweight backpackers or anyone looking to save weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - At <strong>35 degrees</strong> this is a sleeping bag on the colder side of things, and might only be suitable for summer in some places. But for it's temperature rating it's one of the best sleeping bags out there. It uses <strong>excellent 850+ fill down</strong>, as well as a few unique features like square baffles to get down to a <strong>weight of just 1 pound, or 456 grams</strong>, which is quite a drop in weight relative to temperature rating when comparing to the two sleeping bags above. <strong>So not the warmest 3 season sleeping bag, but definitely the lightest</strong>.</li>

Which is why it’s important to get a good pair of <strong>waterproof hiking shoes</strong>, especially if you like to head out in spring, winter or fall. It’s important to keep in mind, however, that waterproof hiking boots can be a little stuffy, and usually do not breath well. If it’s important to you to have a good, breathable pair hiking shoes, then you should pay close attention to the material used for your waterproof hiking shoes.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Shoes</h2>
A few things to watch for when you're shopping for a new pair of waterproof hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathability</strong> – When you get waterproof hiking shoes you don’t want to forget about breathability. Preventing water from getting in to your boots is important, after all, but if your feet cant breath and your feet end up sweating, your feet will get wet. So try to find a balance between waterproof and breathable.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Waterproof often means heavy, but it doesn’t have to. There are many hiking shoe manufacturers out there who use wonderful construction techniques and materials to make <!--more-->lightweight waterproof hiking shoes. You often have to be careful with the durability of such products, but if you know what you’re looking for you can find a good balance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Shoes</h2>
A few of the better choices when it comes to waterproof hiking shoes, broken down for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Waterproof Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818510/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-gtx-trail-running-shoes-mens\">Salomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 GTX</a> - First, a really solid pair of waterproof hiking shoes from Salomon. They use the <strong>XCR version of Gore-Tex</strong>, which is  little more breathable than the stuff that gets used for jackets. They also have the <strong>one pull lace system</strong> that's common to many Salomon shoes. The total weight for the pair is <strong>1 pound 12.4 ounces, which is 810 kilograms</strong>, which is not lightweight, but not especially heavy either.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-moab-gtx-xcr-shoe-mens\">Merrell Moab GTX XCR</a> - Another pair of waterproof hiking shoes, also with a<strong> Gore-Tex XCR liner</strong> that will both keep your feet dry and breath well. Merrell tends to make a comfortable shoe, and beyond that you get a few extras, like <strong>toe bumpers and a vibram sole</strong>, that help with durability and comfort. The pair weighs <strong>1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>, which is a little lighter than the Salomons.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Waterproof Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808733/keen-alamosa-wp-hiking-shoes-womens\">Keen Alamosa WP</a> - First up, a good pair of waterproof hiking shoes from Keen. Whereas most footwear manufacturers use Gore-Tex liners to provide waterproofing <strong>Keen has their own proprietary waterproof liner</strong>. The shoe seems to get mostly positive reviews, and no complaints about water pouring in, so the liner must do a good job. The pair <strong>weighs 1 pound 10 ounces, which is 740 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-siren-sport-gtx-xcr-shoe-womens\">Merrell Siren Sport GTX XCR</a> - This is a waterproof hiking shoe similar to the Merrell Moab in the men's section above. You get a <strong>Gore-Tex XCR liner</strong> to both keep your feet dry and also breathing well. You also get a <strong>vibram sole and a bit of a toe bumper on front</strong>, both of which help with making your hiking shoes durable. The pair weighs a grand total of <strong>1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>, which is the same as the men's Moabs.</li>

For those that don’t know, a <strong>mummy sleeping bag</strong> is tapered towards your feet, so that the areas of your body that aren’t as wide, such as your legs, don’t get as much room as other areas of your body, like your shoulders. By doing this, you save on weight, and also eliminate dead space within the sleeping bag that will take up valuable body heat.
<h2>Mummy Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to think about when you're shopping for your next mummy sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – First and foremost, you need to pay attention to what kind of insulation is in your mummy sleeping bag. The big advantage of a mummy sleeping bag is that it weighs less, but you give that advantage up if you go for synthetic insulation over down. There are some reasons to use synthetic over down, but not many.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Even amongst mummy sleeping bags there is a wide variety of shapes. You can get some very thin mummy sleeping bags that offer little room for your legs to move around, and wider<!--more--> ones that give you some more room, but also add weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mummy Sleeping Bag</h2>
A few of the better mummy sleeping bags out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - First up, at the warmer end of the scale is the Laser 600 from the UK manufacturer Terra Nova. This isn't a well known sleeping or a well known company in North America, but it's certainly deserving of a little praise. For starters it uses very high quality <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which helps it get down to just <strong>1 pound 6 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>, which is a very respectable weight for a <strong>temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong>. A seriously good sleeping bag for three season camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +30</a> - Slightly warmer than the Laser 600, with a <strong>temperature rating of 30</strong>, the Plasma also uses the top quality <strong>900+ fill down</strong>. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It has a few extra features, like a draft collar, which definitely help to keep you warm, but like the Laser 600 the standout feature here is the weight, which is also <strong>1 pound 6 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-alpinlite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down.html\">Western Mountaineering AlpinLite</a> - With a <strong>temperature rating of 20 degrees</strong> this is a sleeping bag better suited to four season camping and backpacking. And while it doesn't get up to the 900+ fill down mark it <strong>uses 850+ fill down</strong>, which is better than just about everything else on the sleeping bag market. It also uses a few extras, like a draft collar, to make sure you stay warm at night. And at <strong>31 ounces, or 880 grams</strong>, it certainly wont add much weight to your backpack.</li>

But then if you ever do need a first aid kit while camping, you better hope that you have one somewhere in your backpack. And if you don’t have one, you better hope someone you’re camping with was smart enough to bring one. But <strong>camping first aid kits</strong> aren’t just for emergencies. A good first aid kit will contain things like mole skin, for instance, that can be extremely useful when camping, and that many people will be able to use on a regular basis to prevent foot worries from becoming foot problems.
<h2>Camping First Aid Kits</h2>
Some things to look for when you're buying a camping first aid kit.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foot Treatments</strong> – A normal first aid kit does not come with much, if anything, that’s intended to treat foot problems. But foot problems are one of the most common problems that you’ll experience as a camper, and so it pays to have a few things, like mole skin, to <!--more-->treat some of the more common foot problems, like hot spots and blisters.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Also important for a camping first aid kit is waterproofing. Many things inside a first aid kit, such as bandages and instruction booklets that first aid kits often come with can be damaged by exposure to water, something that exists in abundance in the outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping First Aid Kits</h2>
A few of the very best camping first aid kits, for a variety of group sizes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-watertight-3-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Ultralight .3 First Aid Kit</a> - First, a <strong>small, lightweight first aid kit intended for solo campers</strong> and backpackers. This really is just the minimal gear, and gives you enough equipment to deal with foot problems, cuts, a few other things but not really much else. It does come in a <strong>resealable plastic bag</strong>, however, and even better, it <strong>weighs just 3 ounces, which is 85 grams</strong>, making it ideal for lightweight backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/718294/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-9-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Ultralight .9 First Aid Kit</a> - If you'd prefer something a little bigger and better stocked, but still not especially heavy, this larger kit, also from Adventure Medical, is ideal. It has <strong>enough supplies for 1-4 people for up to 4 days</strong>. It has the basics of the .3 version above, plus a few other things that might come in handy, like irrigation syringes and a few additional medications. It's also <strong>waterproof, and weighs 10.4 ounces, or 294 grams</strong>. This line of kits also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708124/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-5-first-aid-kit\">.5</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695383/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-7-first-aid-kit\">.7</a> size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-weekender-first-aid-kit.html\">Adventure Medical Weekender First Aid Kit</a> - And finally, if you're going to be the designated first aid person for a larger group then you'll likely want something like the Weekender, which contains <strong>enough supplies for 1-6 people for up to 7 days</strong>. It has plenty of the basics, as well as quite a few extras, like instruction booklets for various scenarios, as well as disposable thermometers and tweezers, which are useful for things like ticks and slivers. It <strong>weighs 1 pound 10 ounces, or 737 grams</strong>.</li>

When the temperature rises and there’s no chance of rain, what you really want to do while hiking is let your feet breath a little. Sweaty, confined feet are never very comfortable over a long day of hiking. And despite the fact that sandals like flip flops are fairly unisex, there are actually some important differences between men’s and <strong>women’s hiking sandals</strong>, just like there are differences between men’s and women’s hiking shoes. Men and women have different feet, after all, and this requires a different kind of footwear for each.
<h2>Women’s Hiking Sandals</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for your next pair of women’s hiking sandals.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sole</strong> – What you definitely don’t want in a hiking sandal is the kind of sole that you would find on a traditional sandal. Remember that you’re going to be hiking, and that you want to have a good, rugged <!--more-->grip on the trail beneath your feet.</li>
	<li><strong>Straps</strong> – Similar to the point above, you don’t want something that looks like a traditional sandal. The straps on your hiking sandal should do a good job of securing your foot in place, so you don’t have to worry about your foot slipping and sliding around, or worse, coming out of the sandal while you’re hiking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Hiking Sandals</h2>
Only the very best women’s hiking sandals.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/chaco-z-2-unaweep-sandal-womens-cha0040\">Chaco Z/2 Unaweep</a> - At first glance these don't look like much of a hiking sandal, but a few standout features, like a <strong>vibram sole</strong> for excellent grip, help to set these women's hiking sandals apart. The <strong>strap system is fairly minimal</strong>, but they will keep the sandals secure on your feet. And the minimal amount of upper material means that your feet get <strong>plenty of ventilation</strong>. A great hiking sandal if you want something simple.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798168/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-womens\">Vibram FiveFinges Sprints</a> - Not quite a hiking sandal, but they fulfill much the same purpose, by allowing your feet plenty of open air to breath. The<strong> individual toes combined with the very thin sole means you get a real feel for the ground</strong> and what you're walking on. They also <strong>dry extremely quickly</strong>, meaning that they will do water just as well as a sandal would. And finally, the strap across instep ensures that they wont go anywhere. <strong>Not a hiking shoe for everyone, but definitely one to consider.</strong></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-newport-h2-sandal-womens\">Keen Newport H2</a> - If you're looking for something that is more a combination of shoe and sandal, the Newport H2 is a good choice. The <strong>upper portion of the shoe resembles a shoe</strong> with large chunks removed. Even the rudimentary lacing system is similar to what you would find on a shoe. That, combined with a <strong>good sole and toe guard</strong> make these a good choice for those looking for ventilation without too much exposure.</li>

But hot food is a great way to end a long day on the trail, and <strong>backpacking pots</strong> are an important part of the equipment necessary to getting that hot meal. But there are many different options available, when it comes to backpacking pots, and you have a few decisions to make before you buy a backpacking pot.
<h2>Backpacking Pots</h2>
A few things to look at more closely when you are shopping for backpacking pots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a few different choices available when it comes to the material of your backpacking pot. Titanium is definitely the best, as it weighs very little and is also fairly durable, but it also costs the most. Aluminum and stainless steel are both cheaper, with their own positives and negatives.</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – This is an obvious one, but you definitely don’t want to overlook it. You need a pot that is big enough to cook food for you, and anyone that you’ve brought with you. With this in mind, it’s often a<!--more--> good idea to get a set of cooking pots, so that you have the right size for several different group sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Pots</h2>
A few of the best backpacking pots on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset</a> - If you need more than one pot, this set from Snow Peak is a great choice. It comes with <strong>two different pots with two different lids. The lids both double as frying pans</strong>, as well, making it a versatile set of cookware. Each pan and pot comes with a <strong>folding handle</strong>, and because it's titanium, the each piece is about as lightweight as you will find, though also not cheap.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-alpine-2-stainless-steel-pot-set\">MSR Alpine 2 Stainless Steel Pot Set</a> - If you'd prefer something <strong>strong, durable and relatively cheap</strong>, and aren't so concerned about weight, stainless steel is an ideal material. This is a set of <strong>two pots, and one lid that fits both</strong>. You also get a <strong>pot grabber</strong> that will work with the lid or either pot. Just remember that because this is stainless steel it weighs quite a bit more than the more expensive titanium options.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-non-stick-pot-w-handle\">Evernew Titanium Non-Stick Pot</a> - If you're going solo and only need one pot, then a single titanium pot is a great choice, though this backpacking pot <strong>comes in 7 different sizes</strong>, so there's something for everyone. What's different about this pot is the <strong>non-stick coating, which is fairly common on aluminum pots but not so much on titanium</strong>. Non-stick is especially great for cleaning up after you've done your cooking.</li>

Some materials, like silk, are great because they just feel amazing to sleep against. Others, like fleece, are warm but also extremely bulky and heavy, and not very practical for most campers and backpackers. <strong>Thermal sleeping bag liners</strong>, more often referred to as thermolite sleeping bag liners, have one big thing going for them, which is a lot of warmth without a lot of weight, making them ideal for backpackers and campers looking to save on weight and bulk.
<h2>Thermal Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
What features you should be watching for when you are shopping for a thermal sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Degrees Added</strong> – When buying a thermal sleeping bag liner you have to give serious thought to just how many degrees you want added to your sleeping bag. Thermal sleeping bag liners can add a surprisingly large amount of warmth, and keep in mind that there are other materials that will add warmth too, though usually not as much as thermolite.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – You want to make sure to get a sleeping bag liner that is the same shape as the sleeping bag it <!--more-->will be used in. A rectangular sleeping bag liner, for instance, will be too large for a mummy shaped sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thermal Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
There aren't too many thermal sleeping bag liners out there, but these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/766028/cocoon-thermal-liner-mummy\">Cocoon Thermal Liner</a> - First, a good thermal sleeping bag liner from Cocoon, who make quite a few different liners. It's made with <strong>CoolMax fabric, a kind of polyester</strong>, which helps to wick away moisture well. It also adds quite a bit of warmth, something like <strong>10 to 12 degrees, and weighs 15.4 ounces, or 436 grams</strong>, which is kind of heavy, relative to how much warmth you get. It's also <strong>mummy shaped</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Liner</a> - Another sleeping bag liner, this time made of <strong>thermolite fabric, which is a hollow core fabric</strong> more or less designed to add warmth as efficiently as possible. This particular liner adds about <strong>15 degrees of warmth, and weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, which as you can see is a much better warmth to weight ratio than the Cocoon liner above. It's also a mummy shape.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/reactor-extreme-thermolite-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme Thermolite Liner</a> - Another thermolite liner from Sea to Summit, this one intended for extreme weather. This one adds a very <strong>impressive 25 degrees of warmth</strong> to a sleeping bag, which will easily transform a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag. It <strong>weighs 14 ounces, or 399 grams</strong>, which is about as lightweight as you're going to get without buying a whole new sleeping bag with a lower temperature rating.</li>

Features to be aware of when you are reviewing various backpacking flashlights.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Brightness</strong> – One of the more important variables when it comes to a backpacking flashlight is how bright it can get. You may not want to illuminate the whole forest, after all, but you will likely want to at least be able to see what’s in front of you without having to point the flashlight right in that direction.</li>
	<li><strong>Color</strong> – The color of the light is another thing to consider. Many backpacking flashlights are red, or come with an <!--more-->optional red cover. The reason for this is that red light does not spoil your night vision, meaning that when you turn a red tinted flashlight off you will be able to see much better than you otherwise would.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Flashlight</h2>
A few of the better backpacking flashlights that you have to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/632461/photon-micro-light-ii-led-light\">Photon Micro Light II LED</a> - Most things that you need a flashlight for when backpacking, like finding a piece of gear at the bottom of your bag or not tripping over anything on your way to the bathroom at night require very little power. The Micro gives you a grand total of <strong>1.5 meters of illumination</strong>. But it's tiny, at <strong>.17 ounces, or 5 grams</strong>, and depending on the color (red is available) it <strong>will last for 120 hours</strong>, which makes it the perfect choice for lightweight backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-amp-series-flashlight\">Princeton Tec Amp Series Flashlight</a> - The Tec Amp is more of a <strong>traditional, handheld flashlight</strong>. It comes in <strong>three different sizes, the medium giving out 50 lumens of light for 160 hours and weighing 206 grams</strong>. It comes with a handy lanyard, to make sure you don't lose it, and is water resistant too, never a bad feature to have in a flashlight. If you want something handheld for backpacking, this is an ideal choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tactikka-xp-adapt-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka XP Adapt Headlamp</a> - Flashlights can be good, but often when backpacking you need both hands free and the area in front of you illuminated, such as when trying to get a stove started early in the morning or late at night, in which case you need a headlamp. The Tactikka XP is a great choice. It has <strong>three power modes</strong>, and <strong>several colored lenses</strong> that will help preserve night vision. With the batteries included the whole thing <strong>weighs 4.2 ounces, or 120 grams</strong>.</li>

For camping, hiking, backpacking and other outdoor pursuits, there are a couple of things to consider. One is battery life, another is the weight of the LED headlamp itself. And of course you have to think hard about just how powerful a headlamp you will need, and what kind of power settings will best suit your purposes.
<h2>Best LED Headlamp</h2>
What you should expect to find on the best LED headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lens Color</strong> – Many headlamps are either tinted red or will have a removable lens that goes over the LEDs that is tinted red. The reason for this is that red light does not spoil night vision. When you’re in the outdoors having night vision can be important, and so that little red lens can be an important addition to your headlamp.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – Another important variable when it comes to LED headlamps is battery life. Many headlamps will have low power modes that can last for a hundred hours or more. Some <!--more-->very bright LED headlamps will only last a few hours. Be aware of the difference, and plan according to what your needs are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best LED Headlamp Reviews</h2>
A few of the very best LED headlamps to help you see in the dark.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm Headlamp</a> - First up, a very solid LED headlamp from Black Diamond. It just has one strap for around your head, no over the top strap. But at <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong> it's not so heavy that you really need that extra strap. It has a <strong>max output of 100 lumens</strong>, and will last for a very impressive total of <strong>200 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>. It also has a <strong>red LED option</strong>, to preserve night vision. A great headlamp with all the best features.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus Headlamp</a> - Another headlamp without an over the top strap, this one better suited to lightweight backpackers and campers, with a very impressive <strong>weight of 2.4 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>. It's not especially powerful, but will go for <strong>150 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>, which is nothing to frown at. It doesn't have any actual red LEDs, but it does have a <strong>red lens for preserving night vision</strong>. Another very good LED headlamp, this one ideal for lightweight backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/icon-3-watt-led-headlamp\">Black Diamond Icon LED Headlamp</a> - <strong>Winner of the Best in Gear award from the climbing magazine Rock and Ice</strong>, the Icon is a great LED headlamp. It's the heaviest on the list, at <strong>4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>, but it has a top strap to help handle that extra weight. It will put out <strong>100 lumens on the high power setting, and will go for 165 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>. It also has  a medium power setting in between those two extremes.</li>

Tents and bivy sacks are both viable options, but so is a hammock. A hammock requires a few things, like trees, or tree-like objects to set up with, but most hiking and camping spots have trees, and make excellent hammock spots. A good <strong>hiking hammock</strong> provides you with just as much protection from the weather as something like a tent, without the bulk and large footprint.
<h2>Hiking Hammock</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a new hiking hammock.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Package</strong> – You can get a hammock, but there is a lot of equipment that you will likely need to make your hammock usable. A suspension system, for instance, is required so that you can hang your hammock. You will likely also need a tarp to go over your hammock. If you don’t have this extra equipment, consider getting a package that contains everything you need.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Proof</strong> – Strongly consider getting a bug proof hammock, that will keep mosquitoes and other pests away from you at night. Bug netting adds very little weight, and <!--more-->can be a real life saver when bugs are persistent and you want to escape them at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Hammock</h2>
A few of the very best hiking hammocks to choose from, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hammock-bliss-no-see-um-no-more-hammock.html\">Hammock Bliss No-See-Um Hammock</a> - If you just need a hammock, then this particular model from Hammock Bliss is a good choice. It's<strong> just the hammock and 100 inches of cord for hanging</strong>, and doesn't come with a tarp, but what it does have built in is a <strong>no-see-um net</strong>, as the name suggests. It will also <strong>hold a total of 350 pounds, and weighs a total of 28 ounces, which is 793 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/skeeter-beeter-ul-hammock\">Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter UL Hammock</a> - This is another hammock, <strong>without a tarp, but with a suspension system</strong> so that you can hang it right away. Like the one above it uses a <strong>no-see-um net enclosure</strong> to protect you from mosquitoes and just abut everything else. This hammock will only <strong>hold 250 pounds</strong>, but does also weigh less than the one above, at just <strong>20 ounces, or 567 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight Hammock</a> - Finally, if what you want is the whole package, the Explorer is a fantastic choice. The hammock comes with a <strong>no-see-um netting enclosure, and you also get both a suspension system and a tarp</strong>, so that you're protected for whatever weather might come your way. It will <strong>hold up to 250 pounds, and it weighs 2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>, but keep in mind that you're getting a tarp too, which the other two above do not come with.</li>

You wont get far in the outdoors without a good water bottle, but at the same time, many outdoor enthusiasts just grab whatever water bottle they have lying around the house. And while there’s certainly nothing wrong with this strategy, there are actually some fairly innovative water bottles for hiking out there, that will help you save on weight and bulk, both of which are important to many hikers, campers and backpackers.
<h2>Water Bottles for Hiking</h2>
Things you should be considering when picking out a water bottle for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – There aren’t many variables when it comes to water bottles for hiking with, but capacity is definitely one of them. Water bottles come in all different kinds of sizes, and there are even water reservoirs that can hold 6 liters of water, for those long stretches in the heat when you don’t have access to any fresh water.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – BPA is largely a thing of the past, but there was a time when many people avoided plastic water bottles for health reasons. If you’re at all concerned<!--more--> about the potential chemicals in the plastics used for water bottles, stainless steel is a viable, if heavier, option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Bottles for Hiking</h2>
A few of the better water bottles for hiking that you will find on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-bottle-12-40-oz\">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel Bottles</a> - If you prefer metal over plastic, Klean Kanteen has a whole range of them to pick from, in <strong>stainless steel, ranging in capacity from 12 ounces to 40 ounces. The weights range from 4 ounces, which is 113 grams, all the way up to 11 ounces, which is 311 grams</strong>. So compared to the water bottles below it's not the lightest option, but it's about the only choice you have if you want to avoid plastic.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-cas0448.html\">Platypus Platy Plus Bottle</a> - You would think it would be difficult to really innovate on the concept of the water bottle, but that's exactly what Platypus have done. This bottle is made of a <strong>flexible plastic that can be rolled up when not in use</strong>, something that may be very useful for a backpack stuffed full. They wont be solid when full of water, and they'll be a little easier to break than your average water bottle, but they do have an upside, which is weight. The bottle comes in <strong>two different sizes, a 1 liter and a 2 liter, and they weigh .8 ounces, or 22 grams, and 1 ounce, or 28 grams, respectively</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/402049/nalgene-wide-mouth-loop-top-round-bottle-32-fl-oz\">Nalgene Wide-Mouth Loop-Top</a> - No list of water bottles for hiking would be complete without a mention of Nalgene. This is the classic <strong>32 ounce</strong> version, which is made of a hard but lightweight and extremely tough plastic. The wide mouth top makes filling easy, and many water filter manufacturers actually make attachments with the wide mouth of the Nalgene in mind. Beyond that it <strong>weighs 3.5 ounces, or 99 grams</strong>, which is not as lightweight as the Platypus, but much lighter than the stainless steel bottles.</li>

But when water quality is relatively good and all you have to worry about is the stuff in your water that you cant see with the naked eye, <strong>camping water purifiers</strong> are an ideal solution. Water purifiers are often a lighter option than filters, depending on what kind you get, and do just as good of a job at making your water drinkable.
<h2>Camping Water Purifiers</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for camping water purifiers.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Drinkable Timeframe</strong> – The one real drawback of many water purifiers is that they can take quite a while to make your water drinkable. In particular, this is a drawback of chemical purifiers, which can sometimes take hours to neutralize everything that might make you sick in the water. When you’re thirsty, this time can matter.</li>
	<li><strong>Purification Method</strong> – There are a few different ways to purifier your water that really don’t have very much in common. Chemicals are extremely lightweight, for example, but can take a long <!--more-->time to work. Something like UV light, however, works quickly, but tends to burn through batteries relatively quickly. Just know that you have a few different options.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Water Purifiers</h2>
A few of the best camping water purifiers, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti.html\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - First up, a <strong>UV light water purifier</strong>. UV light a great purifier for a couple of reasons, the most important being that it works extremely quickly. At a rate of <strong>8 minutes per gallon</strong>, you can get through quite a lot of water in a short amount of time. The drawback of UV light, however, is that the batteries don't last all that long. After about 50 liters you have to replace them. But the unit <strong>weighs just 3.6 ounces, which is 102</strong>, a very respectable weight for a lot of purified water.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">Katadyn Micropur Tablets</a> - If what you want above all else is to save on weight, chemicals are the best way to get your water purified. These tablets from Katadyn weigh a grand total of just <strong>.9 ounces or 25 grams for a total of 30 tablets, each of which will purify 1 liter of water</strong>. The drawback with these tablets is that they <strong>take 4 hours to work</strong>, and sometimes you're thirsty now.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/671111/msr-sweetwater-water-purifier-system\">MSR SweetWater Purifier System</a> - The SweetWater is a <strong>combination of filter and purifier</strong>. It's the kind of thing you want when you would really rather not be drinking from whatever water source you find yourself drinking from. It uses chlorine to purify the water,  but basically it works just like a regular pump water filter would. It <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, or 320 grams</strong>, so it's a little heavier than the other two options, but then it also does a much more thorough job.</li>

Some of the more advanced backpacking GPS units will tell you where you are and a lot more too, including information about your surroundings like altimeter and barometer readings. Some will even tune in to NOAA weather reports, making them an indispensible piece of equipment to have in the outdoors.
<h2>Backpacking GPS</h2>
Features to look at when buying a new backpacking GPS.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – Most backpacking GPS units have a fairly similar battery life, typically in the 15 to 20 hour range. But still, that five hours of difference is not nothing, and so you should definitely take the battery life of a backpacking GPS unit in to consideration before buying.</li>
	<li><strong>Screen</strong> – Backpacking GPS units run the gamut of screen quality, from pixelated black and white screens all the<!--more--> way up to high resolution color screens. There’s nothing wrong with the black and white, low resolution screen, but the higher resolution color can reveal details about the terrain that you likely will not get on a lower end model.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking GPS</h2>
Some of the better backpacking GPS units out there, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/garmin-gps/oregon-450-gps-unit\">Garmin GPS Oregon 450</a> - GPS units are very useful for backpacking, but they're also useful for a number of other things. The <strong>Oregon 450 has a number of profiles for a number of different uses, including recreation, marine, automotive, geocaching and fitness</strong>. So depending on what you're doing, you switch the profile and the GPS switches to accommodate that activity. A few features that backpackers may find particularly useful are a <strong>digital compass and altimeter</strong>. The Oregon 450 <strong>weighs 6.8 ounces, which is 192 grams and the battery will last 15 hours</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-etrex-vista-h.html\">Garmin eTrex Vista H</a> - On the low tech side of things is something like the eTrex. All it has is a <strong>black and white, low resolution screen</strong>. It does, however, have a <strong>barometric altimeter and compass</strong>, which are both useful and fairly standard features to find on a GPS unit. The <strong>battery lasts for 18 hours, and it weighs 5.3 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>. It's a fairly basic unit, and the price reflects that.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/825518/garmin-rino-650-gps2-way-radio\">Garmin Rino 650 GPS</a> - The Rino 650 is a great piece of technology to take backpacking. The <strong>screen is full color and high resolution</strong>, and the feature set is long, and includes basics like an <strong>altimeter and compass</strong>, as well as more advanced features like the ability to <strong>pick up weather report radio broadcasts</strong> and even download satellite imagery with a subscription. The <strong>battery only lasts for 14 hours but it's rechargeable</strong>, and the whole thing <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, or 320 grams</strong>.</li>

You have a few different options when it comes to materials for something like a camping cup, but metal is always a good option. But there are a few different kinds of metal available that you will find <strong>metal camping cups</strong> in, and each has positives and negatives associated with it. Titanium is the best, but is also the most expensive metal, and if you don’t want to spend a lot, there are a few other options available.
<h2>Metal Camping Cup</h2>
What to be looking for when you're looking to get a new metal camping cup.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – You’ve decided on metal for your camping cup, but there are actually a few different kinds of metal that you will find camping cookware in. Titanium is the best choice, being both strong and lightweight, but it’s also expensive, and if you’re not looking to spend much, stainless steel and aluminum are two other options.</li>
	<li><strong>Double Walled</strong> – Metal camping cups heat up quickly when you put something hot in them like coffee or tea. A handle is a good way to prevent yourself <!--more-->from being burned, and a double walled construction helps too. A double walled camping cup also helps to insulate your hot beverage and keep it hot longer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Metal Camping Cup</h2>
Some of the very best metal camping cups that you will find on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">Snow Peak Titanium Double-Wall Cup</a> - If you foresee yourself drinking a lot of hot beverages while camping then you might want to seriously consider a double walled cup. Titanium is a great option because it's lightweight, so even though you're doubling up on the material, this still only w<strong>eighs 4.2 ounces, or 119 grams</strong>. And it <strong>holds 16 fluid ounces</strong>, so plenty of room for a lot of liquid, and the <strong>handle folds down for easy storage</strong>. One thing to note is that you cant use a double walled cup as a make-shift cooking pot.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/aluminum-mug\">Esbit Aluminum Mug</a> - There aren't many aluminum cups on the market, but this one from Esbit is probably one of better ones. It <strong>holds 12 fluid ounces, and weighs 2.8 ounces, or 79 grams</strong>. The one real failing here is that the <strong>handle doesn't fold down</strong>, and juts out, which means you'll have to get a little more creative to pack it without wasting space.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-single-wall-cup-600.html\">Snow Peak Titanium Single Wall Cup</a> - If you would prefer a single walled cup, this is likely your best choice. It <strong>holds an impressive 21 ounces of fluid</strong>, which is more than enough for just about everyone, and <strong>weighs 2.8 ounces, or 79 grams</strong>, which is the same as the much smaller aluminum Esbit cup above. The <strong>handle also folds down</strong>, which makes it easy to store when you're not using it. If you want the best, this is it.</li>

But even with something as basic as <strong>enamel camping plates</strong>, you have many different options that can result in drastically different products. Size, for instance, is a big one, as is something like high edges, which can be an important addition to a camping plate when you’re eating large meals off of your lap in the dark. A camping plate is no good, after all, if all of the food ends up on the ground or in your lap.
<h2>Enamel Camping Plates</h2>
A few things to think about when shopping for new enamel camping plates.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – There aren’t many variables and features when it comes to a plate, especially when you’ve already decided on a material, but one is the size of the plate itself. With camping plates it’s usually best to go big, as meals can be quite big, and you are rarely lucky enough to be eating on a level surface.</li>
	<li><strong>Sides</strong> – Related to size, you should also be on the lookout for a camping plate with high sides. As alluded to, you<!--more--> don’t always have the luxury of eating off of a level surface when you’re camping. Often you’re eating out of your lap, and if you want to keep your food on your plate and not on the ground or your lap, high sides on your plate helps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Enamel Camping Plates</h2>
There aren't too many enamel camping plates out there to choose from, but these are a few of the best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401033/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-soup-plate\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Soup Plate</a> - A good all around enamel camping plate. It's more of a combination between bowl and plate, with <strong>.75 inch high sides</strong>. The plate is actually a <strong>stainless steel interior that has an enamel coating</strong> on the outside. This is great for strength and durability, but not so much for weight. At <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, there are quite a few lighter options in materials like titanium.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401163/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-plate\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Plate</a> - The <strong>same basic plate as the one above, but without the .75 inch deep sides</strong>. It also weighs less, at just <strong>11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>, which is still quite heavy when compared to other materials like titanium. The plate also has a<strong> diameter of 10.4 inches</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/coleman-12-piece-dining-set.html\">Coleman 12-Piece Enamelware Dining Set</a> - If you plan to go camping or backpacking with more than one person, as most people do, it's likely cheaper to get a whole set, rather than just individual plates. This set comes with <strong>four enamel camping plates, bowls and mugs</strong>, for a total of 12 pieces. No word on the weight or size of individual items, but these seem to be pure enamel, rather than coated stainless steel like the GSI plates above, so they're bound to be significantly lighter.</li>

This is for your safety and also for the bears. Bears that become habituated to getting food from campers are bears that are far more likely to have to be put down one day. Hanging food is one good option, and a <strong>bear proof canister</strong> is another. Many national parks actually require that you use a bear proof canister when camping within the park, which makes a bear proof canister a good investment if you’re the kind of person that goes camping a lot.
<h2>Bear Proof Canister</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for a new bear proof canister.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – A bear proof canister is meant to keep what is a very large, powerful animal away from something that it wants quite badly. The point is that bear canisters are often quite heavy, because it’s not easy to make something bear proof, and while there aren’t many bear canisters to choose from, there is quite a weight difference between many of them.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Some bear canisters are bigger than others, and depending on how many people are going to be using the canister, along with how<!--more--> many days you plan to be using the bear canister, the size of your bear proof canister could vary quite a bit. So for that reason it’s best to do a quick calculation and find the bear canister that’s the right size for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Proof Canister</h2>
A few of the better bear proof canisters that you'll find out there on the market, though there aren't too many to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/624081/garcia-bear-resistant-container\">Garcia Bear Proof Canister</a> - If what you're looking for is to save on weight, this canister is definitely a contender. It <strong>weighs 2.75 pounds, which is 1.24 kilograms</strong>, and for that you get <strong>10 liters of storage capacity, which is about 6 days of food</strong>, depending on how much you plan on eating.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - This is the <strong>biggest bear proof canister on the list, at 11.7 liters</strong>, but it's also the <strong>heaviest, at 4.4 pounds, which is 1.92 kilograms</strong>. It's enough room for a good <strong>weeks worth of food</strong>. The one feature that this bear canister has going for it is that it's <strong>bright yellow</strong>. Bears will sometimes drag your bear canister out of camp and in to the woods before they give up on it, and so in the morning you have to go looking for it. Bright yellow is an easy color to spot.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister.html\">Bear Vault BV500</a> - The BV500 is the <strong>best overall bear proof canister</strong> on the market. It's both <strong>lightweight, at 2.56 pounds, which is 1.16 kilograms</strong>, and also quite <strong>large, at 11.5 liters</strong>. It also has a nice, big opening so you can easily get food in and out. Best of all, however, <strong>it's clear, so rather than digging through every time you want a granola bar you can spot the granola bar inside</strong> and then grab it, making your life a whole lot easier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>National Parks Approval</h2>
One of the main reasons that people buy bear proof canisters is that they're required in many national parks where bears are found. When buying a bear proof canister for use in a national park, just be sure to check that the bear proof canister is approved for use there. As of this writing all the above canisters are approved, but that can change quickly if it's found that one of them is not functioning as intended, and bears are getting in."

You probably wont ever need them, but if you do one day need to pull them out, you’ll be extremely glad that you bothered to pack them. And when deciding on what survival essentials to bring camping with you, <strong>camping survival knives</strong> are an excellent idea. A knife is a versatile tool that can be used in any number of different ways when you’re in the outdoors. Many survival knives also come with things like flints and whistles built in to them, to further enhance the usability of the knife.
<h2>Camping Survival Knives</h2>
Features to look for when you are reviewing camping survival knives.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – Your basic knife is just something sharp, and while just that is an extremely useful tool that has any number of applications, a good survival knife usually comes with a few more bells and whistles. One popular example is a flint of some kind, that can be used, in conjunction with the knife, to strike a spark and start a fire.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed Blade</strong> – A folding knife will certainly be better than nothing when you find yourself in a survival situation, but a fixed blade knife is better than a<!--more--> folding blade knife. There are a lot of things, like using the knife to pry, or using the butt to smash something, that you are better off doing with a fixed blade knife, as you’ll be less likely to break it than you would a folding knife.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Survival Knives</h2>
Some of the very best camping survival knives out there on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816234/gerber-bear-grylls-ultimate-knife\">Gerber Gear Grylls Ultimate Knife</a> - You may not be convinced by the Bear Grylls endorsement, but Gerber is a well known and well respected name when it comes to knives, and they make a quality product. It's a <strong>fixed blade knife with a 4.8 inch blade</strong>. The <strong>sheath has a diamond sharpener built in, and a ferrocerium striker</strong> that can be used in conjunction with the knife to create fire. It's also <strong>partially serrated</strong>, to increase your cutting options, and has a <strong>whistle attached via a lanyard</strong> to the handle. As far as extra features go, it's hard to beat this knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/skeletool-cx\">Leatherman Skeletool CX</a> - A multi-tool is definitely something to consider when looking for a knife to use as a survival item. This particular one has a <strong>knife, pliers, wire cutters and a few other features</strong> that you may find useful when you find yourself in a survival situation. It also <strong>won the 2008 National Geographic Adventure Magazine Best of Adventure Gear award</strong>, so you know it's a quality piece of equipment.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-big-rock-camp-knife.html\">Gerber Big Rock Camp Knife</a> - If all you're looking for is a knife that you can depend on when you find yourself in a survival situation, the Big Rock is a great choice. It's a <strong>solid, fixed blade knife with a 4.5 inch blade</strong>. There's a hole on the butt of the handle where you could attach a lanyard with some other small piece of survival equipment, but beyond that it's just a dependable knife. It also comes in<strong> two versions, one with a section of blade that is serrated</strong>, which would be a good feature to have in a survival situation.</li>

It opens up a whole new world, and kids love to play in the snow. <strong>Snowshoes for kids</strong> are, naturally, smaller than the adult version. Snowshoes work on the idea of spreading your weight out over a larger area, so that not as much pressured is being put on any one section of snow, so that you don’t sink in. Since kids weigh less, their snowshoes are smaller, which also helps with their smaller legs and feet.
<h2>Snowshoes for Kids</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for snowshoes for kids.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Recommended Weight</strong> – One of the more important variables when it comes to snowshoes is the recommended weight. Snowshoes work by displacing weight over a larger area, and if the weight is too much, the snowshoe just becomes a large, novelty shoe. So it’s important to get a snowshoe with a weight range suitable for your child.</li>
	<li><strong>Boys and Girls</strong> – Snowshoes are fairly unisex, and children’s snowshoes even more so, but there are boys and girls <!--more-->snowshoes. Some of it comes down to aesthetics, but there are a few differences, like size, that do sometimes distinguish to two. As related above recommended weight matters, and girls snowshoes, for example, will usually be smaller, with a smaller recommended weight range.</li>
</ul>

Some of the best snowshoes for kids that you can choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/776452/msr-denali-tyker-snowshoes-kids\">MSR Denali Tyker Snowshoes</a> - The Tykers are a great snowshoe <strong>for kids being introduced to snowshoeing</strong>. They will fit <strong>children's shoe sizes of 7.5 to 13.5</strong>, and are recommended for kids <strong>up to 80 pounds</strong>. They're <strong>unisex</strong>, and come in a gender neutral red, so good for boys or girls. They have a few good features for kids, including a tab and hole binding system that is very easy to use, even with gloves on. They <strong>weigh 1.9 pounds, which is 878 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/tubbs-flex-jr.-snowshoe-kids.html\">Tubbs Flex Jr. Snowshoes</a> - Another pair of snowshoes for kids that work well as an <strong>introduction to snowshoeing</strong>. Like the Tykers  these are a completely plastic frame, and are meant for <strong>weights of between 40 and 90 pounds</strong>. The bindings are a ratchet style, which is easy to use with gloves on. Finally, the snowshoes <strong>weigh 2 pounds, which is 907 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/glacier-youth-snowshoes-unisex\">Tubbs Glacier Youth Snowshoes</a> - These are snowshoes more intended as a step up from the introductory level and a slightly older age group. The recommended <strong>weight is 80 to 150 pounds</strong>, and they have a <strong>nylon deck and aluminum frame</strong>, rather than the more basic plastic of the other two listed above. These also have slightly better crampons, for improved grip and better off trail travel, and are <strong>unisex. The pair weighs 3 pounds, or 1.36 kilograms</strong>.</li>

The most common use of gaiters, after all, is to keep moisture from getting down the tops of your boots in to the interior, where it makes your feet uncomfortable. Gore Tex does this well, and it lets your feet breathe too, which is always a bonus. <strong>Gore Tex gaiters</strong> are also amply suited to keep debris out of the tops of your boots, another thing that gaiters are often used for. Gore Tex wont hold up so well against snakes, one more thing that gaiters are used for, but then that’s probably not what you’re going to be using them for anyway.
<h2>Gore Tex Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for Gore Tex gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Gaiter come in a wide variety of heights ranging from the ankles all the way up to the upper calf. And while there is nothing wrong with an ankle gaiter, the aim of Gore Tex gaiters<!--more--> is likely to keep water out, in which case a higher pair of gaiters, that reach up to somewhere on the calf, will be the best way of keeping your feet dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Replaceable Strap</strong> – One of the areas that gets warn out fast on gaiters is the strap that goes underneath the boot. This strap is replaceable on most gaiters, and is also usually quite durable, but even so, it pays to make sure that the strap is replaceable, because if and when it wears out, you don’t want to have to buy a whole new pair of gaiters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gore Tex Gaiters</h2>
There aren't many Gore Tex gaiters out there, but these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/645763/black-diamond-gtx-frontpoint-gaiters\">Black Diamond GTX FrontPoint Gaiters</a> - These are a slightly shorter pair of Gore Tex Gaiters, reaching up to just the <strong>mid calf</strong>. The upper portion is <strong>Gore Tex lined nylon, while the bottom is ballistic nylon</strong>, to minimize the chance of tears and rips from abrasions. The tops also have a drawcord, so that it's easy to get a good seal around your leg. They're <strong>unisex, and weigh 8.9 ounces, or 252 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens.html\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - These are likely the <strong>most popular gaiters of any material</strong> on the market. The <strong>tops are a very durable Gore Tex, while the bottoms are 1000d cordura</strong>, to ensure that they remain durable despite the occasional abrasion. They go all the way up to the<strong> upper calf</strong>, and use a buckle system to get a good seal against your leg. These are the mens, there's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens.html\">women's version</a>, and these <strong>weigh 10.2 ounces, or 289 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/apex-gaiter\">Black Diamond Apex Gaiters</a> - Another pair of <strong>upper calf length</strong> gaiters, this time from Black Diamond. These have <strong>tough Gore Tex uppers and even tougher bottoms</strong> to ensure that they aren't damaged by a few bumps and scrapes. Like the Crocodiles, these also use a buckle and strap to ensure a good fit around the top of your calf. They <strong>weigh 8.1 ounces, which is 229 grams</strong>.</li>

When the sun is out, most people don’t relish the idea of sticking their foot in to a tight, enclosed space where it will just sweat. Much better to expose your feet to the air and let some real ventilation happen. <strong>Hiking sandals for men</strong> and women are ideal for those sunny days, and while they’re not as well suited for other seasons, you will be thankful you picked up a pair when the heat really hits.
<h2>Hiking Sandals for Men</h2>
Features to try and find when reviewing hiking sandals.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sole</strong> – One of the important areas to look at one hiking sandals is the sole. Yes, you’re wearing sandals, but you’re also hiking, and just like with a pair of hiking shoes, you need a good, stable grip on what’s under your feet, and the first contact that you have with the ground is the sole of your hiking sandals.</li>
	<li><strong>Straps</strong> – You also need to make sure that your feet stay on the sandals, and for that you need a good, secure system <!--more-->of straps to keep your foot in place. Some straps can be fairly minimal, but still get the job done. As long as your feet wont be coming up or sliding around, you shouldn’t have any problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Sandals for Men</h2>
Some of the best hiking sandals for men currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/748162/keen-arroyo-ii-sandals-mens\">Keen Arroyo II Sandals</a> - The Arroyo is more like <strong>a shoe that has had large chunks removed</strong> for ventilation purposes. It has the same lacing system that you would find on a pair of hiking shoes, though the <strong>one pull lacing system</strong> is quick and easy to use. It has the same sole that you would expect to find on a pair hiking shoes too, including a toe bumper. The only thing that puts it in the same category as sandals are the chunks of the upper that have been removed for ventilation. <strong>If you're looking for a shoe, sandal hybrid these are ideal</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/chaco-z-2-unaweep-sandal-mens.html\">Chaco Z/2 Unaweep Sandals</a> - At the other end of the spectrum from the Arroyos are the Unaweeps. They're <strong>very minimalist</strong>, and though the <strong>sole is made by Vibram</strong> it's not especially developed. The upper is also just a few straps, though they are well positioned to keep the sandals firmly on your feet. So if you would prefer <strong>something closer to a real sandal and don't mind your feet being more exposed</strong>, the Unaweeps are a great choice, minimal, but lacking nothing important.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798240/vibram-fivefingers-kso-multisport-shoes-mens\">Vibram FiveFingers KSO Multisport</a> - Though these aren't technically sandals, they serve much the same purpose, by keeping your feet well ventilated and allowing you to get in the water if you so desire. The <strong>sole is very minimal at just 2 millimeters thick</strong>, but keep in mind that theses are made by Vibram, who are renowned for making an excellent, functional sole. The <strong>individual toes</strong> and the thin sole definitely give your feet a workout, but they do grow on you. If you're looking for a minimalist hiking sandal and a conversation starter, these are great.</li>

It’s such a popular insulator because it has a better warmth to weight ratio than just about any other material in its class. It allows you to stay warm without adding much weight, which is ideal for backpackers, hikers and campers. <strong>Down jackets for women</strong> and men also pack down extremely small, another feature that backpacker, hikers and campers will definitely appreciate. The only thing it doesn’t do well is get wet, but with a few precautions you can avoid that.
<h2>Down Jackets for Women</h2>
Things to look at when you're considering buying a down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – One of the more important things to look at when buying a down jacket is the quality of the down. Down quality varies quite a bit, from the lower end of 600+ fill down up to the higher end, of 900+ fill down. Higher quality down will provide more warmth for less weight than low quality down, a trade off that backpackers, hikers and campers in particular should pay attention to.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Another thing to look out for on down jackets is a waterproof, or at least water resistant exterior. Remember that you should never be getting down <!--more-->wet, and unless you want to have to pull out a rain shell every time it starts sprinkling, a waterproof or water resistant outer is a good idea on a down jacket.</li>
</ul>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-women-s\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> - First up, the <strong>2011 winner of the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. This is a fantastic down jacket by a couple of different metrics. First, it uses the <strong>high quality 800+ fill down</strong>. One thing that it has that you don't find on many down jackets is <strong>a hood</strong>. Hoods are great for regulating body temperature, and a useful feature for backpackers and campers. It also has a <strong>DWR treatment</strong> to help keep water out. If you're looking for a down jacket to take camping or backpacking, it will be hard to do better than this.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787088/patagonia-down-sweater-womens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - For something a little more suited to <strong>around the town as much as the trail</strong>, there is the Down Sweater from Patagonia. There's no hood, but the <strong>800+ fill down</strong> will definitely help to keep you warm. Beyond that it has a <strong>water repellent finish</strong>, which helps to keep the down dry and you warm.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens.html\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you're looking for a down jacket to <strong>keep you warm in the worst weather</strong>, you want a Canada Goose jacket. Despite the name this jacket is actually made with <strong>duck down, not goose</strong>. It's a big and thick jacket, and has things like fleece lined pockets, a <strong>water resistant finish and a fur lined hood</strong> to keep you warm when it's seriously cold out. Canada Goose jackets are not cheap, but for cold weather they're the best.</li>

It does an excellent job of keeping you warm, but admittedly, down does the job better. It also does a great job of cutting the wind. It’s also naturally water resistant, and will keep you dry through a few spring showers. So women’s and <strong>men’s fleece jackets</strong> are the ideal piece of gear for a wide variety of situations, which makes a fleece jacket a must have piece for just about anyone who spends a considerable amount of time in the outdoors.
<h2>Men’s Fleece Jackets</h2>
Features to look for when buying a new men's fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – For campers, hikers and backpackers especially, a hood is a very useful thing to have on a fleece jacket. You lose a lot of heat out of your head, after all, and a hood helps with that. It also helps keep your neck warm, another area that is often sensitive to the cold.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – Fleece comes in a wide variety of thicknesses and densities. Thick, dense fleece, for instance, will <!--more-->keep you very warm and will break the wind well. Thin, porous fleece, on the other hand, will be much more breathable, and perhaps a better choice if you’re active, but will not, for example, be much protection against the wind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Fleece Jackets</h2>
These are some of the better men's fleece jackets out there right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/afterburner-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Afterburner Jacket</a> - First up, a simple enough looking fleece jacket with some stand out features. It actually comes built with a layer of <strong>Gore Windstopper</strong>, which is made by the same people who do Gore-Tex, and which helps block out both wind and water, making this a great jacket to take along when you're not sure what the weather's going to do. <strong>Velcro cuffs and zippered hand pockets</strong> round out the features for this rather good men's fleece jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/770813/patagonia-synchilla-snap-t-fleece-top-mens\">Patagonia Synchilla Snap-T Fleece</a> - This is a <strong>fairly basic, value focused fleece jacket</strong> from Patagonia. It's definitely light on features, the biggest one being the price itself, which is a fair bit lower than the other two jackets on this list. There are a couple of buttons on the collar to give you some ventilation options, and a <strong>buttoned breast pocket</strong>, but other than that this is just a basic fleece jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens.html\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - The R1 is a fantastic fleece jacket ideal <strong>for those who like to be active in the outdoors</strong>. It <strong>has a hood</strong>, for starters, which is a great feature to have. You can put it up when you stop and things get cold, and then down when you start moving again. It also has a <strong>fairly tight fit, to help hold in body heat, and zippered breast pocket along with thumb holes in the sleeves</strong>. The fleece fabric itself even has little lines cut in to it to help with ventilation. This is a fleece jacket where the details were thought long and hard about, and a great buy for those who like to stay active.</li>

A <strong>packable rain jacket</strong> is definitely a good thing to have though, especially if you’re a camper, hiker or backpacker. If you’re taking a rain jacket along on the off chance that you might get wet, the last thing you want is a big, bulky piece of equipment. You want something that you can stuff away and forget about, until you really need it.
<h2>Packable Rain Jacket</h2>
Things to look for when you're buying a new packable rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Storage Pocket</strong> – Many of the more packable rain jackets will fold up in to a pocket that is built in to the jacket itself. And while this is by no means a necessary feature to have on your jacket, it is a convenient feature to have, especially if you are looking to be able to quickly pack your rain jacket up in to a small package and slip it in to your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Pit Zips</strong> – Even with a small, lightweight, packable rain jacket, it is important to retain the ability to stay well <!--more-->ventilated. And while there are many ways of doing this, pit zips, which are zippers underneath the arm pits, are still one of the best ways to do it. Rain jackets can get stuffy, after all, and the last thing you want to do is start sweating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Packable Rain Jacket</h2>
A few of the better packable rain jackets to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762779/outdoor-research-foray-rain-jacket-mens\">Outdoor Research Foray Rain Jacket</a> - First, a great little jacket from Outdoor Research. It uses <strong>Paclite, which is the lightweight, minimalist version of Gore-Tex</strong>, and it has <strong>pit zips</strong>, as well as a full length front zipper, to give you plenty of ventilation options. Beyond that it's lacking on features, which does help to cut down on bulk and weight, though it does have an <strong>inner pocket that doubles as the jackets stuff sack</strong>, for packing. It <strong>weighs 16 ounces, or 453 grams</strong>. The <strong>women's version</strong> is called the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762754/outdoor-research-aspire-jacket-womens\">Aspire</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046.html\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> - Another <strong>Gore-Tex Paclite jacket</strong>, this time from Marmot. It has <strong>pit zips and a front zipper</strong> to keep you well ventilated, though no inner pocket to stuff the jacket in to, which is where it really differs from the Foray above. The two jackets are an identical weight, however, this one also being <strong>16 ounces, or 453 grams</strong>. So if you don't want that inner pocket to stuff the jacket in to, this is a better choice. Here's the <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - Another rain jacket from Marmot, this one really designed with a small and packable in mind. It uses a <strong>waterproof coated nylon</strong> for waterproofing, and has the <strong>requisite pit zips and full length zipper</strong> for ventilation. What it has that the other two don't is, first, <strong>reinforced areas on the shoulders and hips</strong>, which prevent a backpack from rubbing and damaging the jacket. It also weighs significantly less, at just <strong>9 ounces, or 247 grams</strong>, making it a great option for when you want to save on both bulk and weight.</li>

Women’s and <strong>men’s hiking pants</strong>, the right hiking pants, can do quite a lot for you. The right hiking pants will breath well, and if they do get wet, either from your sweat or a little rain, they dry quickly. A good amount of pockets is important, and a few zippered pockets is even better. Regardless of what season it is, the right pair of hiking pants will keep you comfortable all day long.
<h2>Men’s Hiking Pants</h2>
Things to be watching for when shopping for men's hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nylon</strong> – There are a few different fabrics that you can choose from when buying a pair of hiking pants, buy nylon is the most popular, and the best by most standards. It is tear resistant first of all, but more importantly, it dries very quickly, so whether it gets wet from sweat or rain, you can count on it to be dry in a short amount of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Convertible</strong> – Another feature to consider when it comes to men’s hiking pants is the ability to convert in to hiking <!--more-->shorts. Many hiking pants have a zipper around the knee that allow you to remove the bottom portion of the pants, quickly turning them in to a pair of shorts for when the weather improves and you start getting hot in pants.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784059/rei-adventures-pants-mens-30-inseam\">REI Adventure Pants</a> - First, a very popular pair of hiking pants from REI. These <strong>aren't convertible</strong>, they're just a straight pair of hiking pants. They are, however, <strong>made of nylon</strong>, which will dry very quickly when wet, and they have plenty of zippered pocket space to store your essentials in while on the trail. They have a <strong>UPF 50+ rating</strong> too, so that you're well protected from the sun. These are the <strong>30 inch inseams</strong>, which seem to be the most popular, and there are also <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784056/rei-adventures-pants-mens-28-inseam\">28 inch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784060/rei-adventures-pants-mens-32-inseam\">32 inch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784061/rei-adventures-pants-mens-34-inseam\">34 inch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784062/rei-adventures-pants-mens-36-inseam\">36 inch</a> inseam options available.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-paramount-peak-convertible-pant-mens.html\">The North Face Paramount Peak Convertible Pants</a> - Another pair of men's hiking pants, these ones <strong>convertible</strong>, as the name suggests. Beyond that they're <strong>DWR coated nylon</strong>, so not only will the pants dry quickly when wet, the DWR makes them water resistant, so these are an ideal option for wet conditions. They also have a <strong>UPF 30 rating</strong>, for sun protection, and come in a variety of sizes. An excellent option with some great features.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.railriders.com/men-eco-mesh-pant-with-insect-shield-p-837.html\">Rail Riders Eco-Mesh Pants</a> - One more pair of men's hiking pants, these with something a little different. These aren't convertible, but they do have a zipper running down the outside of either leg. <strong>Lowering the zipper exposes mesh, which provides plenty of ventilation</strong> to overheated legs. They're also <strong>nylon, to dry quickly</strong>, and have a few zippered pockets for stashing important stuff. One more thing that really stands out about these is that they have a <strong>bug repellent coating</strong>, making them a great option for backpacking and camping in bug heavy conditions.</li>

An <strong>insulated sleeping pad</strong> will go a long ways towards giving you a nice, warm night of sleep. It’s an especially important piece of gear to have in the colder months of the year, when you really cant afford to have all that heat that you lose out of the bottom of your body just seep away in to the environment and not be reflected back at you.
<h2>Insulated Sleeping Pad</h2>
Things to consider when shopping for an insulated sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – When it comes to insulation you have a few different options, even with sleeping pads. There is down, of course, which is lightweight and very warm, relative to its weight. But there is foam too, which has the added bonus of working better than down when wet.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – When looking for a warm sleeping pad the one thing that you really need to pay attention to is the R-value of the sleeping pad. A high R-value <!--more-->of 8, for instance, means the sleeping pad will reflect a lot of your body heat, whereas a lower R-value, closer to 0 means most of that body heat will escape.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Insulated Sleeping Pad</h2>
A few of the better insulated sleeping pads to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778152/rei-camp-bed-35-self-inflating-pad\">REI Camp Bed 3.5</a> - If you're looking for an insulated sleeping pad <strong>for base camp or car camping</strong>, then Camp Bed is an ideal choice. No one's ever going to call it light, at <strong>80 ounces or 2.27 kilograms, but at 3.5 inches thick and an R-value of 7,</strong> it will definitely be comfortable. It uses a combination of <strong>foam insulation and inflation</strong>, and is a good choice, pricewise, if you're not concerned with weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hinman-sleeping-pad\">Big Agnes Hinman Sleeping Pad</a> - The Hinman is another <strong>good choice for the value conscious</strong>. It's <strong>R-value isn't especially high, at 5.8</strong> for the regular size, but it doesn't weigh a huge amount either, at <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>, and is a good blend of price and features. The insulation comes from a <strong>combination of inflation and foam insulation</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad.html\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - If you want the best, the DownMat 9 is likely it. It's the warmest sleeping pad on this list, with an <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, and also the lightest sleeping pad on the list, with an impressive <strong>weight of 36 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms.</strong> It achieves this impressive weight, in part, by using <strong>700 fill down, rather than foam, as the insulation</strong>. It's also inflatable, and 3.5 inches thick, giving you more than enough comfort. Besides being the lightest and warmest on this list, it's also the most expensive. Quality does tend to cost more.</li>

The <strong>best hiking jacket</strong> is the one that does it all. It will keep you dry when you find yourself in a spring shower, and it will breath well, so that you don’t get overheated while pounding out miles. The best rain jackets also cut the wind down, so that you don’t get cold in a strong breeze. While you could own several jackets for each of these roles, just one, solid hiking jacket is best.
<h2>Best Hiking Jacket</h2>
Things to try and find on a good hiking jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – When shopping for a hiking jacket you need to decide if you are going to want something waterproof or not. This will likely depend quite a bit on where you live and what seasons you enjoy hiking in. If there is a good chance of getting wet on your average hike, then having a waterproof, or at least water resistant hiking jacket is a good idea.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is another feature to definitely consider when picking out a hiking jacket. You need to stay warm in <!--more-->the outdoors, and since your head is one of the areas where you lose the most body heat, the ability to trap that heat in gives you a wide range of control over your body temperature. Use the hood when you’re cold, and slide it off when you’re hot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Jacket Reviews</h2>
Some of the very best hiking jackets you could hope to buy.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799081/the-north-face-apex-bionic-jacket-mens\">The North Face Apex Bionic Jacket</a> - First up a good, basic soft shell jacket from The North Face that would do very well for hiking. It's <strong>outer finish is both wind and water resistant</strong>, so that you're protected from the elements.

And no hood, though it does have a high collar and full length zipper, which gives you some ventilation options. Definitely a good, basic hiking jacket. There's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799348/the-north-face-apex-bionic-jacket-womens\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens.html\">Patagonia R1 Hoody</a> - This is a fleece jacket, though it's certainly not your average fleece jacket. It's <strong>form fitting, first, to keep body warmth close</strong>, and there are tiny lines cut in to the interior of the fleece, which helps with ventilation. It also comes with <strong>a hood and a 3/4 length zipper</strong>, to add to your ventilation options. There's just one pocket, on the breast, to store a few things in.

You sweat, are exposed to a wide variety of temperatures, and maybe even some ugly weather, like rain or a wind storm. At the same time, you’re hoping that the sun will shine, and sometimes it even works out like that. You need <strong>camping shirts</strong> that can handle all of that, and hopefully just one shirt that can do the job. As long as you’re will to look past the cotton shirts in your closet and invest in something that will last, camping shirts can handle just about anything you throw at them.
<h2>Camping Shirts</h2>
Features to consider when you're buying a new camping shirt.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Whatever material you decide to get a camping shirt in, you should definitely decide to leave the cotton shirts at home. Wool is a good option, though not the scratchy sweater kind. Wool regulates temperature very well, and is a natural antimicrobial. Nylon is another good choice, because of its ability to dry quickly.</li>
	<li><strong>Collar and Sleeves</strong> – While a simple t-shirt has a certain appeal, options like long sleeves and a collar give you a few more options. When it gets cold, for instance, you<!--more--> can put the sleeves down, and when the sun comes out, to give another example, you and your neck will be thankful that you have collars to help protect your skin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Shirts</h2>

And while you may have to worry about a bit of a sunburn on your exposed legs, you definitely wont have to worry about overheating.
<h2>Hiking Shorts for Men</h2>
What to look for when you're in the market for a new pair of hiking shorts.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When it comes to hiking shorts you have a few different choices of material, but the best, and one of the most common is definitely nylon. Nylon has a couple things going for it, the most immediate being that dries extremely quickly, which is never a bad thing to have in outdoor clothing. It’s also tear resistant, another excellent feature for outdoor clothing.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets</strong> – While just about every self respecting pair of hiking shorts will come with pockets, it really helps to have <!--more-->a few beyond the basic two for your hands. Zippered pockets, for instance, are great for keeping a few essentials safely tucked away, and cargo pockets are quite useful when you need that extra space.</li>
</ul>

But a <strong>camping umbrella</strong> does an equally good job, and while it might not be suitable for many situations like a windstorm, to name one obvious one, an umbrella has a lot of advantages over the traditional rain jacket, such as the ample amount of ventilation it provides. No one ever got overheated from wearing an umbrella, for instance, a problem that many people who wear rain jackets experience if they’re not careful to prevents themselves from becoming overworked.
<h2>Camping Umbrella</h2>
Features to try and find when you're shopping for camping umbrellas.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – The size of your camping umbrella, or more accurately the diameter of the umbrella when it’s open can be rather important. You don’t want a very small umbrella, because you need some amount of protection from the weather. But at the same time, an umbrella that is overly large will easily catch the wind, another situation that you want to avoid.</li>
	<li><strong>Compactness</strong> – What you definitely do not want to do is bring a big umbrella from home. When camping it helps to have gear that is compact when you’re not<!--more--> using it, so that it’s not taking up a great deal of room in your backpack. An umbrella that is compact can fit in to a pocket, which makes it easily accessible, so that you don’t have to take your backpack off to get at it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Umbrella</h2>
Some of the very best camping umbrellas for sun, rain or both.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-dome-trekking-umbrella\">GoLite Dome Trekking Umbrella</a> - For those that would prefer a nice, big camping umbrella to shelter under, there is the GoLite Dome. With a <strong>diameter of 45 inches</strong> it's bigger than either of the other two umbrellas below. But size does tend to weigh more, and at <strong>11 ounces, which is 311 grams</strong>, this is also the heaviest camping umbrella on this list. Still, a great umbrella for use while camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/792725/rei-flyweight-siliconized-nylon-manual-umbrella\">REI Flyweight Siliconized Nylon Umbrella</a> - The Flyweight is a good middle-of-the-road camping umbrella. It's a good size, with a <strong>diameter of 36 inches</strong>, and doesn't weight too much either, at <strong>7.1 ounces, which is 201 grams</strong>. It's also nice and small when packed up, and could easily fit in to a jacket pocket, so that you don't have to go searching for it when you do end up needing it. The <strong>carrying case even has a little carabiner on it</strong> for attaching to your backpack, if you don't have any available pockets.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-trekking-umbrella\">Mont Bell U.L. Trekking Umbrella</a> - If you'd prefer something small and lightweight, this umbrella from Mont Bell is both the lightest and smallest on the list, at <strong>32 inches of diameter and 5.8 ounces, which is 164 grams</strong>. 32 inches isn't large by any means, but it is big enough to cover you and a backpack from sun or rain. And being so small it does, of course, pack up in to a nice, small package for easy carrying.</li>

Men’s and <strong>women’s trekking poles</strong> are actually fairly similar, and many pairs are actually unisex. But there are many other variables that you have to be aware of when it comes to buying trekking poles that have nothing to do with gender. But as long as you know what you’re doing, there’s no reason you cant find the perfect pair of trekking poles for you.
<h2>Women’s Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for women's trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are two main choices that you have when it comes to trekking poles, and those are aluminum and carbon fiber. Carbon fiber is lighter, but also more expensive, whereas aluminum is cheaper and heavier, and also a little more durable and forgiving.</li>
	<li><strong>Length</strong> – Most trekking poles are adjustable, so that you can buy a pair and fine tune the length to your exact fit. But if you choose to buy fixed length trekking poles, you <!--more-->can save a lot of weight. Of course you have to be sure you’re buying the right length.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Trekking Poles</h2>
Some of the best women's trekking poles that you will find out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> - These are actually a <strong>fixed length, unisex trekking pole</strong>, so you have a number of size options when you order, which makes them an ideal choice if you're a woman looking for a specific fit. They're also <strong>carbon fiber</strong>, and that combined with the fixed length makes these extremely lightweight, at just <strong>9.5 ounces, or 270 grams</strong>. Despite being fixed length they do fold down, just like tent poles do. Finally, the <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you can be assured they're high quality.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/812378/rei-traverse-powerlock-womens-trekking-poles-pair\">REI Traverse Powerlock Women's Trekking Poles</a> - A <strong>woman specific pair of aluminum trekking poles</strong> from REI. What separates them from the men's version is a <strong>shorter length and smaller grip</strong>. They come in three sections, so that you can easily adjust the size to your specific needs, and they <strong>telescope down to just 24.8 inches</strong>, for easy packing. Finally they weigh <strong>1 pound 1.5 ounces, which is 496 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/trail-trekking-poles-1\">Black Diamond Trail Trekking Poles</a> - This is another pair of <strong>unisex trekking poles</strong> from Black Diamond that come in a compact size, which is shorter, with smaller grips, and ideal for women. They're <strong>aluminum, and have three telescoping sections</strong>, so that they pack easily when not in use. There's also material to grip below the handle, so that you can choke up for steep descents for more control. Finally, they <strong>weigh 18.6 ounces, or 528 grams</strong>.</li>

These <strong>4 season sleeping pads</strong> tend to have a few innovative features that make them quite a bit warmer than your average sleeping pad. These extra features do tend to make them a bit heavier than other sleeping pads, but when it comes to staying warm in winter, you really have to put your comfort over the weight of your gear, within reason of course.
<h2>4 Season Sleeping Pads</h2>
Features to look for when reviewing 4 season sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – The main thing that you need to pay attention to when buying a 4 season sleeping pad is its R-value. What’s important to now is that a high R-value, of 7 or 8, for instance, means that the sleeping pad will reflect a lot of body heat, and an R-value of 1 or 2, for example, will reflect little or no body heat.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Shape also matters quite a bit when it comes to 4 season sleeping pads. It’s great if you can stay centered on a mummy<!--more--> sleeping pad, but if you find yourself with body parts hanging off of the sleeping pad then those parts of your body aren’t getting the benefit of the sleeping pad. So if you’re a restless sleeper you want to seriously consider rectangular sleeping pads.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 4 Season Sleeping Pads</h2>
Some of the better 4 season sleeping pads, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810372/therm-a-rest-trail-pro-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Trail Pro</a> - With an <strong>R-value of 4.8</strong> this is a good sleeping pad for milder winter conditions. It's an <strong>inflatable sleeping pad with foam built in</strong> to the top, which is where the increase in warmth comes from. It's also <strong>2 inches thick</strong>, and has a <strong>slight tapered shape</strong> from the hips down to the toes. It weighs a grand total of <strong>2 pounds, which is 910 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/two-track-pad-2-in\">Big Agnes Two Track Pad</a> - With a slightly higher <strong>R-value of 6.5</strong> the Two Track is a sleeping pad best suited to winter conditions. Like the Trail Pro it's a <strong>combination of inflatable sleeping pad and foam</strong> for the higher R-value. Unlike the Trail Pro, however, it comes in two different shapes, <strong>a mummy and a rectangular</strong>, so that you can choose whichever suites your sleeping style best. The rectangular version weighs <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - If you're heading somewhere cold and need a warm winter sleeping pad the DownMat is ideal. It has an impressive <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, and an even more impressive weight of just <strong>2 pounds 2.6 ounces, or 980 grams</strong>. It pulls that impressive weight to warmth ratio off by using <strong>700+ fill down, rather than foam</strong>, as the method of insulation. It's also <strong>rectangular, and a total of 3.5 inches thick</strong>, making it an even more comfortable choice for sleeping in the outdoors.</li>

Not that many people end up going solo backpacking or camping, after all, and while it can be useful to have a solo tent, just in case you’re the odd one out when it comes to putting together enough tents for a group, a 2 person tent is ideal because it fits 2 people just as well as it fits one. So you can go with two, but if you do need a 1 person tent, your 2 person tent will be ideal, if a bit roomy and slightly heavier than it really needs to be.
<h2>2 Person Tent</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a 2 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Floor Size</strong> – Pay attention to the square feet of the floor size of different 2 person tents, because what one manufacturer deems to be enough room for 2 people is not necessarily what another manufacturer would call enough room for 2 people. And of course some people <!--more-->are bigger than other, necessitating the need for less, or more room inside.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – If you’re the person in the group that gets stuck carrying the tent, you had better hope it’s a lightweight tent. Even within 2 person tents there is a huge variety in the weights of various models, and your back and knees will thank you if you invest in a lightweight 2 person tent. Of course if you’re not the one who has to carry the tent it doesn’t matter quite so much.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 2 Person Tent</h2>
Some of the better 2 person tents currently found on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 Tent</a> - When it comes to 2 person dome tents, it's hard to do better than the Fly Creek line from Big Agnes. It <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and is a favorite of backpackers and campers everywhere. First and foremost it is lightweight, at <strong>just 2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong>. And while it's not exactly huge at <strong>28 square feet of floor space</strong>, it is definitely enough room for 2. If you want lightweight and freestanding, this is the ideal tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/squall2.html\">Tarptent Squall 2</a> - If what you really want to do is save weight, the Squall 2 may be a better fit for you. It's a <strong>single wall tent</strong> from a fairly small tent manufacturer that caters more to the lightweight backpacking community. You can <strong>use trekking poles as the tent supports</strong>, though there are also poles available, if you don't use trekking poles. Since it's a single wall design it has plenty of ventilation, and at <strong>30 square feet of floor space</strong> it's a good size for 2 people. What really stands out, however, is the weight, which is just <strong>2 pounds 1.1 ounces, or 940 grams</strong>, which is slightly lighter than the Fly Creek. The price is also significantly less than the Fly Creek.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-i-tent-standard-2-person-4-season\">Black Diamond I-Tent Standard</a> - If you want a tent that you can use year round, you need a <strong>four season tent</strong>. It's lightweight for a four season tent, at <strong>4 pounds 11 ounces, or 2.12 kilograms</strong>, which is due in part to the fact that it's a single wall design. It's also not particularly roomy, at <strong>27.3 square feet of floor space</strong>, but then that's not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to four season tents. And because it's a <strong>single wall design</strong> it has plenty of ventilation options. If you want lightweight and capable of winter camping, this is a great choice.</li>

But there are in fact many excellent <strong>winter bivy sacks</strong> on the market, and a winter bivy sack can and will do an excellent job of protecting you from the worst weather that you will experience in winter conditions. It may get a little cramped inside that bivy sack for some of those longer storms, but what you save on weight and bulk in your backpack makes it worth it.
<h2>Winter Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a winter bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pole</strong> – Poles tend to be one of the things that separate bivy sacks from tents, but when it comes to winter bivy sacks, it can be a lot more comfortable with a pole in your bivy sack. At the very least it will keep the bivy sack off your face and give you a little breathing when you’re curled up inside.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Three season bivy sacks are often waterproof on just the top of the sack, or else use a fabric, like DWR <!--more-->coated nylon, that will perhaps keep you dry in a few showers, but certainly not in a winter deluge. So do yourself a favour and get a bivy sack that uses a higher quality waterproof material.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Winter Bivy Sack</h2>
Some of the very best winter bivy sacks to keep you warm at night.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ascent-bivi\">Rab Ascent Bivi</a> - If you would prefer a lightweight winter bivy sack then the Ascent might be just right for you. It uses <strong>eVent for the top</strong>, which is a waterproof, breathable fabric similar to Gore Tex, but lighter, and a <strong>waterproof floor</strong> to keep the weather outside of your bivy sack, where it belongs. There are <strong>no poles or any support structure</strong>, and just a zipper and optional no-see-um netting to keep the weather at bay, but the trade-off for that is that this bivy sacks weighs an impressive <strong>1 pound 5 ounces, or 600 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747832/outdoor-research-alpine-bivy\">Outdoor Research Alpine Bivy</a> - If you would prefer a winter bivy sack with some sort of support structure to give you a little breathing room at night, Outdoor Research has an excellent option in the Alpine. The <strong>top of the bivy sack is 3-ply Gore Tex</strong>, which will keep you dry and also breath. The <strong>bottom is a more durable coated nylon</strong>, to keep water off of the bottom of your sleeping bag. There's a <strong>single hooped pole over the face</strong>, and the opening has no-see-um netting, so that you can get a little ventilation if the weather is cooperating. All those features add up, however, and this bivy sack <strong>weighs 2 pounds, or 910 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-bipod-bivy-bag\">Black Diamond Bipod Bivy</a> - The Bipod has a design very similar to the Alpine above, with <strong>one hooped pole over the face area</strong>, and no-see-um netting over the face opening, for ventilation options. It doesn't use Gore Tex, however, but instead a fairly similar fabric, called <strong>ToddTex</strong>, which is a fabric developed by Black Diamond. It also weighs slightly less than the Alpine, at <strong>1 pound 13 ounces, which is 822 grams</strong>.</li>

Snowshoeing is fun, after all, but part of the fun is taking them in to fresh, deep snow that hasn’t been trampled down yet. Sales are a good way to find <strong>cheap snowshoes</strong>, but if you’re not willing to wait for a good sale to come around, there are a few things you can look out for if you want a cheap pair of snowshoes to take with you.
<h2>Cheap Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when what you want is cheap snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – One of the variables that tends to make snowshoes more expensive is weight. If you want lightweight snowshoes, that typically means more expensive materials, which makes the snowshoes more expensive. So heavier snowshoes will tend to cost less, though they will leave you a little more tired at the end of the day.</li>
	<li><strong>Plastic</strong> – The traditional snowshoe is an aluminum frame, and then a deck, or surface, made <!--more-->of a very tough nylon. There are, however, some pairs of snowshoes out there where the whole thing is plastic. And because they’re made from plastic they tend to be a little cheaper than the traditional design.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - The Evo snowshoes are a fantastic example of using <strong>plastic</strong>, rather than the traditional aluminum and nylon, to create a snowshoe that is inexpensive without sacrificing performance.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-9-series-frs-snowshoe\">Atlas 9 Series FRS Snowshoes</a> - Another pair of cheaper snowshoes, these with the more traditional <strong>aluminum frame and nylon deck</strong>. These come in <strong>two different lengths</strong>, the 25 inch size having a max weight of 200 pounds and the 30 inch versions having a max weight of 250 pounds.

To help keep the snow out of the tops of your boots or shoes, <strong>gaiters for snowshoeing</strong> are a great investment. They great a good seal around your boots, which sloughs off any snow that might otherwise go down your boots, which helps your feet to stay dry when you’re out snowshoeing.
<h2>Gaiters for Snowshoeing</h2>
Features you will likely want on gaiters for snowshoeing.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Length</strong> – Gaiters come in a few different lengths, from ankle gaiters all the way up to the gaiters that end just below your knee. And while ankle gaiters will be better than no gaiters, the upper calf gaiters will keep a lot more snow out of your boots than the ankle gaiters will.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Depending on how dry the snow you are snowshoeing in is, waterproofing may not be much of a<!--more--> concern. But snow has a habit of sticking to boots and gaiters too, where your body heat melts it. So unless you want that water leaking through your gaiters, it’s a good idea to invest in waterproof gaiters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gaiters for Snowshoeing</h2>
Some of the better gaiters to take snowshoeing.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769562/mountain-hardwear-ascent-stretch-air-permeable-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Ascent Stretch Air Permeable Gaiters</a> - The uppers and lowers of these gaiters are constructed with very durable and waterproof taslan and packcloth, which are variety of nylon. They're <strong>16 inches high, which reaches to about the mid calf</strong> on the average person. A solid pair of gaiters with <strong>an attractive price</strong>, as compared to the other two below.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - Probably the <strong>most popular pair of gaiters on the market</strong> in just about any category. These are a combination of <strong>Gore Tex upper</strong>, which will keep you dry and also ventilated, and <strong>very tough cordura bottoms</strong>, to resist the wear and tear that you often experience on boots. These are another <strong>mid-calf gaiter</strong>, with a height of 16 inches. There's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Extreme Gaiters</a> - Something a little different from manufacturer Rab are the Latok gaiters. They're <strong>waterproof, but they use eVent for the uppers</strong>, a fabric similar to Gore Tex, but lighter. The ankle and boot portion are a more durable cordura, and beyond that they're much the same as any other pair of gaiters on this list. So another choice, and a good one if you're not a fan or Gore Tex, or are a fan of eVent.</li>

Which, if you’re a backpacker, hiker or camper, should be an important metric when considering what kind of jacket to take with you. The only real problem with using down as an insulating material is that it does not do so well in wet conditions. There are ways around that, which the <strong>best down jackets</strong> may use of, but it’s something that you definitely have to keep in mind when buying and wearing down jackets.
<h2>Best Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – There is a wide range of down qualities, which are indicated by the fill number. 700 fill down, for instance, is not nearly as good as 900 fill down. The 900 fill down will provide the same amount of warmth that the 700 fill down does, but with less down, and thus, less weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – The one big weakness of down is water, but the best down jackets prevent, or at least mitigate <!--more-->this problem, by having a waterproof, usually water repellent exterior. That way, things like rain showers and snow flurries get shrugged off, and the down stays dry, and warm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Jacket Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the better down jackets on the market, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Best Down Jackets for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> - This is a down jacket designed with backpackers and campers in mind. It uses very <strong>high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which both makes it extremely lightweight, at <strong>5.7 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>, and also extremely compact when packed up, so that it fits very well in a backpack. And at that light weight it also manages to have a <strong>water repellent finish</strong> on the outer nylon, so that the down is protected from moisture. Definitely one of the best down jackets around.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/770806/patagonia-down-sweater-mens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - The Down Sweater from Patagonia is similar to the Ex Light from Mont Bell in design, with a basic front zip, high collar, elasticized cuffs and <strong>water resistant finish, but also two zippered pockets</strong> for your hands, which the Ex Light lacks. But this jackets only uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, which is high quality, but not 900+ fill like the Ex Light. It also weighs considerable more, at <strong>11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>, making it a less attractive option for backpackers and campers.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Down Jackets for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-womens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> - Very similar to the Ex Light for men above, but with a woman's fit. It lacks most extras, including pockets, but it makes up for that in weight, which is a very light <strong>4.7 ounces, or 133 grams</strong>. Part of how it gets so low in terms of weight is that it uses <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is the highest quality you will find on most commercial products. That high quality down means it will also pack down extremely small, so an ideal choice for backpackers and campers. It also has a <strong>water repellent finish</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787088/patagonia-down-sweater-womens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - Another down jacket, this one very similar in design to the Ex Light, the only major difference that's immediately obvious being that it has two zippered hand pockets. There are a few other differences that you don't see, however, including the <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and the weight, which is considerably more, at <strong>11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>. And it has a <strong>water repellent finish</strong>, to protect the down from moisture.</li>

To help prevent such a scenario from ever happening, <strong>alpine gaiters</strong> are a must. They wont stop you from stepping in to the snow bank, but they will at least make it so that the snow stays outside of your boot. And when it’s your turn to blow trail, gaiters will really shine for keeping snow at bay.
<h2>Alpine Gaiters</h2>
What to try and find on your next pair of alpine gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Gaiters come in the ankle variety, which just go up to the top of the ankle, all the way up to the upper calf kind, that end just below the knee. The height of your gaiters will depend a lot on what conditions you find yourself in, but for large amounts of snow it’s best to get the kind that go up at least to the mid calf, if not the top.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – It should go without saying, but an alpine environment can be a wet place. The snow may be dry, but it will stick to your gaiters where your body heat will melt it. If you don’t want that freshly melted water leaking through your gaiters in to your boots, it’s a good idea to invest in some waterproof gaiters.</li>

Some of the better alpine gaiters available to you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827256/the-north-face-gore-tex-gaiters\">The North Face Gore-Tex Gaiters</a> - First, a great, heavy duty pair of gaiters that would be right at home in any alpine environment. The <strong>uppers are Gore Tex</strong>, to keep your feet dry but not suffocating, and the <strong>bottom sections are tough, durable cordura nylon</strong>, to withstand all the abuse that boots suffer. They're also <strong>unisex, and a mid calf length</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - These gaiters have been around for years, and the reason for that is that they're <strong>extremely popular</strong>. The <strong>upper portion is Gore Tex</strong>, to keep you dry and breathing well, and the <strong>bottom is very tough cordura nylon</strong>, to withstand the abrasion and other abuse that boots suffer. The bottom enclosure is wide enough for a mountaineering boot, but could also handle a smaller, regular boot as well. They're a<strong> mid calf length</strong>, and there's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Extreme Gaiters</a> - If you want to stay dry but aren't a fan of Gore Tex, eVent is a fantastic alternative. The <strong>upper is eVent</strong>, while the <strong>lower portion is cordura</strong>, for durability. Their sized to fit a larger mountaineering boot, and they're <strong>unisex</strong>. Another very good alpine gaiter option, especially as an alternative to Gore Tex.</li>

And that really is important. You can prevent your feet from being exposed to outside moisture fairly easily, but the trick is to also prevent your feet from sweating, and creating that dreaded moisture inside the boot.
<h2>Gore Tex Hiking Boots</h2>
What you want to see when buying Gore Tex hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Leather Outers</strong> – Gore Tex is a fantastic method of keeping your feet dry, but Gore Tex is also very susceptible to damage from wear and tear on the outside of your boots. There are many excellent synthetic options that will protect the outside of your boots, but leather does an excellent job of it, and even better, leather is also fairly waterproof itself, if you take care of it.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – It’s important to know that in terms of energy expenditure, every pound on your feet is equal to about 5 pounds<!--more--> on your back. So wearing big, heavy boots is a bad idea if you don’t want to be falling over at the end of the day. It’s better to invest in a pair of lightweight Gore Tex boots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gore Tex Hiking Boots</h2>
A few of the better pairs of Gore Tex boots on the market, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Gore Tex Hiking Boots</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693828/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-mens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - When it comes to hiking boots in just about any category, the TPS 520s from Asolo are one of, if not the most popular boot on the market. They use a <strong>full grain leather outer</strong>, which both helps to waterproof and has a great, classic look. Inside you get a <strong>Gore Tex liner</strong>, to stop any water that makes it past the leather. And on the bottom a <strong>sturdy Vibram sole</strong> so that you never lose your footing. Being a big, burly hiking boot is not conducive to lightweight design, and at <strong>3 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.73 kilograms</strong>, you will be well aware that you've been wearing boots all day long at the end of a long day of hiking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-mens\">Scarpa Kailash GTX Boots</a> - At the lighter end of the scale are the Kailash boots from Scarpa. They <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and have been a popular choice ever since. They use a <strong>suede outer shell</strong> to help save on weight while still providing protection, and a <strong>Gore Tex liner</strong> to keep water out. Even the sole is called the Vibram Hi-Trail Lite sole, so you can see where these boots are focused. With a weight of just <strong>1 pound 6 ounces, or 623 grams</strong>, they're just a fraction of the weight of the Asolos.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Gore Tex Hiking Boots</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693986/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-womens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - The same basic boot as the Asolo above in the men's boots, but with a woman's cut. They're a combination of <strong>full grain leather outer and a Gore Tex liner</strong>, which gives you some redundancy when trying to keep water out. The <strong>sole is Vibram</strong>, and all you have to do is take one look at the sole and the boot to know that these are durable boots that will last years and years. But durability usually means heavy, and at <strong>3 pounds 5 ounces, or 1.5 kilograms</strong>, these are definitely not a lightweight pair of boots.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-womens\">Scarpa Kailash GTX Boots</a> - Like the Kailash above in the men's section these are the <strong>2008 winner of the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. They use a <strong>lightweight suede outer material, combined with a Gore Tex liner</strong>, to to keep water out and protect from use and abuse at the same time. They also use a lightweight Vibram sole, but what stands out about these is the weight, which is a very impressive <strong>1 pound 3 ounces, or 538 grams</strong>. If you don't want to feel like you've been dragging bricks around on your feet all day, these are a great pair of Gore Tex hiking boots.</li>

The main advantage of a shoe, of course, is that they tend to weigh less than boots. Boots, being larger and bulkier, tend to weigh quite a bit, and every pound on your foot is equal to about five pounds on your back, so those heavy boots are a real drag on your energy.
<h2>Winter Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for winter hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – The most important thing that you want to find on your winter hiking shoes is waterproof of some sort. There are a few companies out there that have their own waterproofing methods and technologies, but a dependable and fairly common option is a Gore Tex liner that will both keep your feet dry and allow them to breath a little.</li>
	<li><strong>Quality</strong> – Shoes are often a little less durable than those bigger and better boots. Which is fine in summer conditions, but in winter, the last thing that you <!--more-->want is a pair of shoes that are coming apart. For that reason, it’s a good idea to look for a quality pair of winter hiking shoes, so that they don’t start falling apart one you.</li>

There’s no reason you cant suffice on cold food when you’re in the outdoors, but a hot meal is so much more satisfying. After a long day of trudging along a trail, a cold meal just does not come close to something hot. There’s the extra work of cooking, of course, but most people would agree that it’s worth it, and the first thing you need for that is a good hiking stove.
<h2>Hiking Stove</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for hiking stoves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Source</strong> – There are a number of different fuel sources available to you when picking out a hiking stove. Liquid fuels and canisters are the two obvious choices, but there are also others, like alcohol and even wood, that are certainly viable options for those that know how to use them effectively.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Stoves are one piece of hiking gear for which there is a great deal of variety in the weights available. You<!--more--> can find many hiking stoves that use the same fuel but are a fraction of the weight of other stoves, and when you have to carry that stove around, that extra weight matters.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/660163/msr-pocket-rocket-backpacking-stove\">MSR Pocket Rocket</a> - When it comes to <strong>canister stoves</strong>, you wont find many smaller or lighter than the Pocket Rocket. It weighs a very slim <strong>3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, and is an incredibly popular choice with backpackers, campers and hikers who prefer to use canister stoves. It will burn for approximately 26 minutes with a 100 gram canister, and <strong>boils water in just under 4 minutes</strong>. A great choice for canister stoves.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-simmerlite-stove\">MSR SimmerLite Stove</a> - If you prefer refillable liquid fuels to canisters, then the SimmerLite is an excellent choice. It works with <strong>white gas</strong>, and will go for 122 minutes, approximately, on 20 ounces of fuel. It will also <strong>boil water in about 3 minutes</strong>, so you can get to eating as quickly as possible. It also <strong>weighs just 8.5 ounces, or 240 grams</strong>, making it one of, if not the lightest liquid fuels stove out there.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-hexagon-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - If you're camping somewhere with large amounts of wood then there's no reason to go dragging fire fuel with you. The Hexagon is actually a<strong> wood stove</strong>, designed for campers, backpackers and hikers. It's a hexagon of titanium that folds down to a small package when not in use. It's also tapered, so that the bottom of your pot, which sits on top of the Hexagon, is the concentration point for the generated heat. It also <strong>weighs a very respectable 4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>, making it an excellent option for taking in to the outdoors.</li>

And there definitely are a few things that you need to be aware of when buying snowshoes. A good pair of snowshoes that are suited to you and the conditions you’re in will perform well, while poorly chosen snowshoes will leave you floundering in the snow or laying in the snow, with the snowshoes pointed skywards.
<h2>Buying Snowshoes</h2>
What to be aware of when you're buying snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – One of the more important things to know about snowshoes is that they have a maximum weight. If you weigh too much for the snowshoes they wont be able to distribute your weight over a wide enough space, and you will end up sinking in to the snow, instead of floating on top.</li>
	<li><strong>Intended Use</strong> – Snowshoes are designed with a few different uses in mind. There are snowshoes designed <!--more-->for running in, for instance, and then there are also snowshoes intended for a leisurely stroll over established trails. There are also snowshoes intended for going off the beaten path with a heavy backpack on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the better snowshoes to consider, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - If what you want is a good <strong>all around snowshoe for hiking and venturing off the trail on reasonable terrain</strong>, the Evos are a great snowshoe. They're an <strong>all plastic</strong> model, rather than an aluminum frame and nylon deck. Plastic has a few advantages, one being that it's usually lighter, and at <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong> they're some of the lighter snowshoes on the market. Plastic is also cheaper, and these are also one of the cheaper pairs of snowshoes you will find. The <strong>maximum recommended load is 180 pounds</strong>, but there are <strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a></strong> that will boost that up to 250 pounds.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lighning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - If you'd prefer to <strong>get off the beaten trail and hike mountains, carry a backpack and have a real adventure</strong>, something like the Ascents is what you need. They're a combination of <strong>aluminum frame and nylon deck</strong>, and the entire rim of the frame has crampons built in, so that even if only part of the snowshoe is in contact with the snow, you still have traction, which is <strong>ideal for steep, uneven terrain</strong>. They come in three different lengths, and a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">women's version</a></strong> as well. The medium men's <strong>weighs 3 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.78 kilograms</strong>, and will <strong>carry up to 220 pounds</strong>. There are also <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">optional tails</a></strong> that will add a a considerable amount of capacity to that total.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - If you just want to<strong> stick to the beaten trails, or if you want to go running in your snowshoes</strong>, then you need something like the Races, from Atlas. They weigh an extremely slim <strong>2 pound 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams</strong>, and they get down to that weight by using a minimal amount of crampons and a superior aluminum for the frame. They're also specifically designed to not interfere with a running gait, so a good choice for covering lots of ground. They will take <strong>a load of up to 190 pounds</strong>.</li>

But in winter you have things like rain and snow to worry about, and even a good pair of winter hiking boots wont stop that moisture from coming down the tops of your boots. Which is why <strong>winter gaiters</strong> are such a great thing to have. The good ones will keep that moisture out, and you dry, without trapping moisture inside your boots.
<h2>Winter Gaiters</h2>
Features to look for when buying your next pair of winter gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – It’s important to know what kind of length you want from your gaiters. There are plenty of ankle gaiters, for instance, that would reach to maybe the bottom of the calf. But when you’re ploughing through snow banks, those are likely to be insufficient, and you would be better served with winter gaiters that go up to the mid calf or higher.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Rain is wet, of course, and snow will stick to your gaiters and melt there. For either scenario, you<!--more--> need a pair of gaiters that are waterproof when you’re out in winter conditions. Gore Tex is a good choice, but there are other materials too, like eVent, that will keep your feet and legs dry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Winter Gaiters</h2>
Some of the best winter gaiters on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827256/the-north-face-gore-tex-gaiters\">The North Face Gore-Tex Gaiters</a> - First up a very durable pair of gaiters that can take a bit of abuse and keep going. The <strong>upper portion is Gore-Tex</strong>, as the name implies, to keep you dry without suffocating your legs and feet. The bottom portion is made with very durable cordura nylon. They <strong>reach up to the mid calf</strong>, and use a strap and buckle system to form a tight seal with your leg. A <strong>well built, durable pair of gaiters</strong> for winter conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-expedition-crocodile-gaiter\">Outdoor Research Expedition Crocodile Gaiters</a> - These are very similar in design to the North Face gaiters above. They use <strong>Gore-Tex for the top section</strong>, to provide waterproofing, and then <strong>cordura nylon on the bottom</strong>, where gaiters tend to take a bit more abuse from things like boots rubbing together. They're also a <strong>mid-calf length</strong>, and use a very similar hook and strap system to secure themselves in place.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Extreme Gaiters</a> - The Latok gaiters from Rab are something a little different. They're another <strong>mid-calf length gaiter</strong>, but these use <strong>eVent, instead of Gore-Tex, to provide waterproofing</strong> on the top section. eVent, for those that don't know, is a great waterproof material very similar to Gore-Tex, though it typically costs less. The <strong>bottom of these is also cordura nylon</strong>, though the top is a drawcord, rather than strap and buckle like the other two above.</li>

One of the more important items to have at your disposal are <strong>cold weather sleeping bags</strong>. They have a lower minimum temperature, ideally close to the average temperature for the area and season you plan to go backpacking or camping in. That way, you stay warm, even in cold weather.
<h2>Cold Weather Sleeping Bags</h2>
Features to be aware of when shopping for cold weather sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation Type</strong> – When it comes to cold weather camping you always have to worry about the wet conditions that so often accompany the colder months of the year. Down is a fantastic insulation, but its one weakness is that it performs very poorly when wet. If you can keep down dry then it’s the best choice, but if not, synthetic insulation is the next best thing.</li>
	<li><strong>Minimum Temperature</strong> – The last thing you want to have to go through when backpacking or camping is a night <!--more-->spent shivering inside a sleeping bag that isn’t warm enough for the conditions you are in. There are things you can do to add warmth, like a sleeping bag liner or extra clothing worn to bed, but nothing beats a sleeping bag with a proper temperature rating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cold Weather Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the better cold weather sleeping bags, at a few different temperature points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-expedition-1200-sleeping-bag-40-degree-down.html\">Rab Expedition 1200 Sleeping Bag</a> - The Expedition 1200 is the <strong>lightest sleeping bag at the -40 temperature mark, at 70.5 ounces, or 2 kilograms</strong>, and a fantastic sleeping bag for when things get really, truly cold. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, and plenty of it, along with a <strong>draft collar, a drawcord around the face</strong> and a few other features to keep you warm. It's a fairly tight fit inside the bag, but there is enough room for most people to wear a few extra layers, should the temperature get even lower.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down EXP</a> - With a <strong>minimum temperature of -20</strong>, this is a fantastic sleeping bag for very cold conditions. The bag uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong> and a big, thick draft collar, among other things, to help keep all the warm air inside the sleeping bag. The <strong>outside of the bag is also water repellent</strong>, so that you don't have to worry about the down inside getting wet. Mont Bell also employs a <strong>diagonal cut on their sleeping bags</strong>, which helps them to coil around you, adding even more warmth. The bag <strong>weighs 3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, making it one of the lighter sleeping bags at the -20 temperature mark.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - The Phantom is one of the lighter sleeping bags at the very popular <strong>0 degree minimum temperature. It uses 800+ fill down</strong> for insulation, and has all the usual features, like a <strong>draft collar and zipper insulation tube</strong>, that you would expect on a cold weather sleeping bag. And at <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms</strong>, it's lighter than many other, much colder sleeping bags.</li>

Most sleeping pads use foam to provide that extra warmth, but a few use down instead. Down has a few advantages, the most obvious being that it tends to weigh quite a bit less than foam, while still providing the same amount of warmth. As with any down product, however, you want to be sure not to get the down in your <strong>down sleeping pad</strong> wet, or it wont do nearly as good a job of keeping you dry.
<h2>Down Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look for when shopping for down sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – The warmth of a sleeping pad is delineated with an R-value. A high R-value, of 8 or 9, for instance, is extremely warm, while a lower R-value, of 2 or 3, is quite cold, and wont provide much warmth. So buy a sleeping pad with an R-value that is high if you plan to be camping or backpacking in cold conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Another feature that you have to pay close attention to when buying a sleeping pad is the shape of the pad itself. Mummy<!--more--> shaped pads are great for those who don’t move around much when they sleep, but if you’re the kind of person that tosses and turns, a rectangular sleeping pad may be a better fit for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Sleeping Pad</h2>
There aren't too many of them, but here are some of the best down sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - When it comes to down sleeping pads there is nothing better than the DownMat 9. It has a very impressive <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, which will keep you warm down to a very impressive -36, and it uses <strong>700+ fill down</strong> to achieve that. It's also rectangular, so plenty of room to roll around at night, and comes with a built in pump for proper inflating. And at <strong>3.5 inches thick</strong>, it will be a very comfortable night of rest. The whole package <strong>weighs 34.6 ounces, which is 980 grams</strong>. It also comes in a deluxe version, which is both wider and longer than the full size version, for a nice, roomy sleep.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780362/exped-downmat-7-air-pad-with-pump\">Exped DownMat 7</a> - The DownMat 7 is the <strong>lighter, colder version of the DownMat 9 above</strong>. This version uses the same 700+ fill down, but only has an <strong>R-value of 5.9</strong>, which will keep you warm down to -11. This version also only has a <strong>thickness of 2.8 inches</strong>, but is the same rectangular length with built in pump that the 9 is. This version comes in three sizes, a regular, a shorter version ideal for women and shorter men, as well as the extra large and wide version that the 9 comes in. The regular size<strong> weighs  32 ounces, or 880 grams</strong>.</li>

There are snowshoes designed with runners in mind, that are small and light enough that it wont feel like you’re wearing something big and bulky on your feet. And of course they will also do the job of keeping you floating on top of the snow.
<h2>Snowshoes for Running</h2>
Features you want to see on snowshoes for running.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – When it comes to running in a pair of snowshoes the last thing you want is something big and bulky strapped to your feet. Heavy snowshoes will sap your energy, and bulky snowshoes will make it difficult to maintain a proper gait.</li>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – Another important thing to look for when shopping for snowshoes for running is the maximum<!--more--> recommended weight of the snowshoes. Running snowshoes tend to be smaller, which means they also wont take as much weight. So make sure that you’re within the recommended maximum weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoes for Running</h2>
A few of the best snowshoes for running.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - If you're looking for the best, these are them. At just <strong>2 pounds, or 907 grams, the lightest snowshoes on this list</strong>. They get there by using a superior aluminum for the frame, and a Nytex for the deck. They have just toe and heel crampons, and <strong>Atlas' spring loaded suspension system</strong>, which helps the snowshoes to not interfere with your natural gait when running. They will take a <strong>maximum load of 190 pounds</strong>. A really fantastic pair of snowshoes for running.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/rnr-22-snowshoes\">Kahtoola Rnr 22 Snowshoes</a> - Another pair of fairly simple running snowshoes, this time from Kahtoola. They're a combination of <strong>aluminum frame and nylon deck</strong>, and are small, with an <strong>elevated front</strong> to make sure you don't trip over your own feet while running. At <strong>2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.27 kilograms</strong> they're lighter than most other snowshoes, but still significantly heavier than the Atlas Races.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805232/atlas-run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - These are a <strong>heavier, but cheaper version of the Atlas Race snowshoes above</strong>. They have the same basic design, with toe and heel crampons, aluminum frame and nylon deck, but the aluminum is a lower quality, which saves money but adds weight. But at <strong>2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.21 kilograms</strong> they're still lighter than the Kahtoola snowshoes above, and have a few features, like <strong>Atlas' spring loaded suspension system</strong>, that runners will definitely appreciate. So a good choice of running snowshoe for the budget conscious.</li>

When it’s dry it has one of the best warmth to weight ratios around, but when down gets wet it clumps, which makes it all but useless for keeping you warm. So a <strong>waterproof down jacket</strong> is a great idea. Most down jackets are water repellent, rather than waterproof, meaning that they will survive a few showers without getting wet, but not a real down pour.
<h2>Waterproof Down Jacket</h2>
Features to look for when buying a new waterproof down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fill Quality</strong> – Down varies quite a bit in quality, based on the fill number. 700 fill down, for instance, provides less loft, and therefore less warmth, than the same amount of 900 fill down does. So whatever kind of down jacket you’re buying, you want to pay attention to the fill number, especially if weight is important to you.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof or Water Repellent</strong> – There are a lot of water repellent down jackets out there, but not as many <!--more-->waterproof down jackets. Part of the reason for this is that down needs to breath, because the warmth it provides comes from loft, and if the exterior of the down is airtight, the loft of the garment is compromised, in much the same way vacuum packing something shrinks it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Down Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best waterproof down jackets, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Waterproof Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> - If you're happy with <strong>water resistant</strong>, and you're buying with camping, hiking or backpacking mind then the Ex Light jacket from Mont Bell is a fantastic choice. It uses very <strong>high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which means it will <strong>pack down very small, perfect for stuffing in to a backpack</strong>. It also means this jacket is extremely lightweight, and at <strong>5.7 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>, you wont find many lighter.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/817524/the-north-face-mcmurdo-down-parka-mens\">The North Face McMurdo Down Parka</a> - If you need a down jacket that <strong>really is waterproof</strong>, then the McMurdo from North Face is a good choice. The <strong>down is lower quality 550+ fill</strong>, but there's plenty of it, and features like a <strong>fur lined hood and plenty of pocket room</strong> help to make up for it. A solid down jacket if what you need is waterproof.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Waterproof Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-womens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> - The same jacket as the Mont Bell in the men's section above, but with a more feminine cut. It uses <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is very high quality, but is only <strong>water resistant, not waterproof</strong>. But the high quality down and low profile means that this jackets <strong>packs down very small, which is ideal for campers, hikers and backpackers</strong>. It also weighs just <strong>4.7 ounces, or 133 grams</strong>, which is also ideal for campers, hikers and backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/817907/the-north-face-greenland-down-jacket-womens\">The North Face Greenland Down Jacket</a> - <strong>If water resistant isn't going to cut it and you need waterproof</strong>, the Greenland is a good choice from North Face. The <strong>down is only 550+ fill</strong>, so this jacket is never going to be thought of as lightweight or compact, but it does have a <strong>good hood with a fur liner, and a couple of pockets</strong> for your hands, both features which the Ex Light from Mont Bell lacks.</li>

They’re typically worn underneath another outer layer, and keep your legs nice and toasty warm, while also wicking moisture away from the skin, which wool is great at doing.
<h2>Wool Hiking Pants</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for wool hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – When selecting a pair of wool hiking pants it’s important to get a thickness appropriate for the weather that you’re likely to find yourself in. You don’t want to get big, thick wool pants when you needed thin ones, because taking off that inner layer of pants can be a trying process.</li>
	<li><strong>Tight</strong> – The tighter your wool hiking pants are, the warmer they will be. A layer that is right against your skin will<!--more--> hold your body heat right against the skin, whereas something with a little more breathing room will allow for a lot more air circulation, and thus a lot more room for heat to dissipate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Wool Hiking Pants</h2>
Some of the very best wool hiking pant options, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Wool Hiking Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-merino-bottom-mens\">Stoic Merino Bottoms</a> - If all you need is a <strong>lightweight pair of wool hiking pants</strong>, then this option from Stoic is ideal. They're a <strong>blend of high quality merino wool and spandex</strong>, for a close fitting, stretchy fit. They will wick moisture well, and of course wool is a natural anti-microbial, so it doesn't absorb much in the way of smells. A great wool hiking pant option if you like to stay active.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/723971/smartwool-midweight-long-underwear-bottoms-wool-mens\">SmartWool Midweight Long Underwear</a> - If you're looking for something a little warmer, then <strong>a midweight option</strong>, like these from SmartWool, is a better fit. They're 100% wool, and being a little thicker, they will add more warmth, but will still wick moisture away, and will resist odors, just like any other wool product.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Wool Hiking Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-merino-bottom-womens\">Stoic Merino Bottoms</a> - The same basic design as the Stoic product above in the men's section, but with a more feminine cut. These are <strong>a lightweight option, a blend of spandex and wool</strong>, so ideal for those that like to stay active, and need something that will add a bit of warmth but still breathe well. And of course they come with one of the main advantages of wool, which is that it's a natural anti-microbial, and absorbs very little in the way of odors.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785385/smartwool-midweight-long-underwear-bottoms-wool-womens\">SmartWool Midweight Long Underwear</a> - If you want <strong>more warmth and less breathability</strong>, then a midweight wool hiking pant is what you want. These are 100% wool, and being thicker than the Stoic option, will add more warmth, so a better option for those cold days. But they're still wool, and will wick moisture and absorb only a limited amount of odor, just like any other wool product.</li>

You just have to remember, when buying <strong>winter down jackets</strong>, that down does not perform very well when it gets wet. So you definitely don’t want to get down wet. Winter conditions can be good in this regard, however, as snow often gets you a lot less wet than rain does. So when the temperature is really low, down actually becomes a better choice.
<h2>Winter Down Jackets</h2>
What you want to find on a good winter down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – You should definitely get a winter down jacket that is waterproof, or at least water resistant. Snow wont be too much of a problem, as far as getting wet is concerned, but rain is a real worry, and the last thing you want in winter is an insulating that suddenly does not work.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> - With a winter jacket the quality of the down may not be quite as important, just as long as there is plenty of it. But for campers, backpackers and hikers, down quality is a good indicator <!--more-->of a few things, the most important being how much the jacket will weigh and how compact it will be. You don't want a winter down jacket that takes up half of your backpack.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Men's Winter Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> - If you're a backpacker, camper or hiker then you will appreciate something like the Ultralight Down Hoodie from Patagonia. It's <strong>thin, with a low profile, but features a hood and two hand pockets</strong>, along with chest pocket, making it a good blend of features and minimalism. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and a <strong>water repellent outer shell</strong>, and the average weight is a very respectable <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>. A winter down jacket that will keep you warm but also stuff in to a backpack without taking up too much room.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If your main concern with a winter down jacket is staying warm, then Canada Goose is the company you want. Despite the name they actually use <strong>duck down</strong> in their jackets, and lots of it. Features like a <strong>snow skirt, fleece lined pockets and a thick, fur lined hood</strong> all help to keep you very warm, even in cold conditions. And the <strong>outer shell is water resistant</strong>, to keep all that down dry. This is a winter down jacket to stay warm in.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Winter Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> - Similar to the Patagonia jacket from above, in the men's section, but with a woman's cut. This one is the same light weight of <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>. You get a <strong>hood, two hand pockets and one chest pocket</strong>, but beyond that this jacket is lacking in features. But that's kind of the point, because the low profile, lack of features and 800+ fill down, along with the water repellent finish, make this an <strong>ideal choice for backpackers, campers and hikers</strong> looking for something to stuff in to a backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - For staying warm regardless of what the temperature is, Canada Goose is the company that most people go to. This particular jacket comes with a <strong>fur lined hood, fleece lined pockets and a water resistant exterior</strong>, features that are all focused on keeping you warm inside. If you were going to the arctic, this is the jacket you would, and in fact many who head to the arctic do take this jacket.</li>

For instance, there are some differences between <strong>snowshoes for men</strong> and women. Snowshoes are fairly unisex, it’s true, but there are a few things about them that can really ruin your snowshoeing experience if you misinterpret. So for the sake of your future snowshoeing experiences, pay attention to what you need in a pair of snowshoes.
<h2>Snowshoes for Men</h2>
What to think about when buying a new pair of snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – Each pair of snowshoes has a maximum recommended weight. Snowshoes work by displacing your weight over a greater area, so that you don’t sink in to the snow. But if the area of the snowshoe is too small for your weight, you will end up sinking, and then the snowshoes wont be of much use to you.</li>
	<li><strong>Intended Use</strong> – Snowshoes actually come in a few different varieties, and the kind of snowshoe you get <!--more-->will depend on what you intend to use them for. For instance, there are running snowshoes that are great for running in, or even walking on established trails in, but would be a poor choice if you decided to throw on a backpack and head off the trail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoes for Men</h2>
Some of the very best snowshoes for men that you have to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - First up, a great pair of <strong>all around hiking snowshoes</strong> from MSR. <strong>They're plastic</strong>, rather than the traditional aluminum frame with nylon deck. But plastic is cheaper, and also quite lightweight. At <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong> these are some of the lighter snowshoes on the market. They will only <strong>hold up to 180 pounds</strong>, but there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a> that can be attached to increase that to 250 pounds.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - If you had <strong>backcountry travel</strong> in mind then something like the Lightning Ascent snowshoes might be more your speed. They have what MSR calls a <strong>360 degree traction system</strong>, where the outer frame of the snowshoes has crampons cut in to the bottom of it, so that you always have a bit of traction. They also have a <strong>heel lift bar, to give you a bit of a boost</strong> and to reduce leg fatigue. The <strong>maximum weight of the medium is 220 pounds</strong>, but there are <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">attachable tails</a> to improve that, if you wanted to carry a heavy backpack, for instance.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - For running, a specific kind of <strong>running snowshoes</strong> are required, and these are the best of them. At <strong>2 pounds 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams</strong> they're some of the lightest snowshoes on the market. They have <strong>just toe and heel crampons</strong>, to give you enough traction to get by without adding unnecessary weight. And runners will definitely appreciate Atlas' <strong>spring loaded suspension technology</strong>, which helps you keep a natural gait, instead of trying to change your gait to accommodate snowshoes.</li>

It can be warm or breathable, depending on what kind of fleece it is, and fleece also does a good job of shedding small amounts of water, so that it’s a definite option even when the weather is a little questionable. If you’re looking for just one jacket for camping, backpacking or hiking, men’s and <strong>women’s fleece jackets</strong> are a great option that will do it all.
<h2>Women’s Fleece Jackets</h2>
Options available to you when buying a new fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If you like to stay active, and want a fleece jacket that can keep up, then you should definitely consider getting a fleece jacket with a hood. A hood allows you a great deal of control over your body temperature, because so much body heat escapes from the head, and keeping that warmth in, and reflecting it, can make you a lot warmer.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – Fleece is a fairly unique fabric, in that it comes in both a wide variety of thicknesses and <!--more-->densities. A thick, dense fleece jacket will be extremely warm and windproof, while a thin, less dense fleece jacket will be much more breathable. Consider what you want before you start your research.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Fleece Jackets</h2>
Some of the better fleece jackets for women that are currently available.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Woman Fleece</a> - The Monkey lives up to its name with <strong>thick, plush fabric</strong> that does an okay job of representing fur. It's thick, but not dense, so you stay warm but it also breathes very well. It doesn't come with a hood, but does have <strong>two zippered hand pockets, plus a zippered chest pocket</strong>. A great fleece jacket for staying warm in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799347/the-north-face-windwall-2-fleece-jacket-womens\">The North Face WindWall 2 Fleece</a> - The WindWall is a great all around option. It's <strong>relatively thick</strong>, to keep you warm, and as the name suggests it's dense enough to eliminate just about all wind chill. And the <strong>hood makes it easy to stay warm</strong> when you get really cold, and then cool off when you're feeling toasty warm again. It also comes with two zippered hand pockets and a zippered chest pocket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flashpoint-hoody-women-s\">Marmot Flashpoint Hoody</a> - The Flashpoint has a design similar to that of the WindWall above, but uses a <strong>thinner weight of fleece</strong>, so not as much warmth, and a bit more breathable. But it has <strong>two zippered hand pockets on either side, a zippered chest pocket and a hood</strong>, so that you have plenty of options to stay as warm as possible. So a good fleece jacket for relatively mild conditions.</li>

There’s nothing wrong with enjoying a little rain in the summer time, it can even be a welcome relief if it’s been a particularly hot and sweaty day. But in colder temperatures the last thing you want to be is wet. And men’s and <strong>women’s rain jackets</strong> will do the job of keeping you dry. Just remember that not all rain jackets are made equal, and some will keep you dry longer than others.
<h2>Women’s Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a new rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – One of the more important things to pay attention to when buying a rain jacket is the material. A DWR coated nylon rain jacket will keep you dry, up to a point, but a material like 3-ply Gore-Tex, or eVent, will keep you dry a lot longer.</li>
	<li><strong>Venting</strong> – An important feature to have on any rain jacket is ventilation. Keeping rain out is important, but your jacket needs to allow sweat and other built up moisture to<!--more--> escape. Pit zips, which are zippered ventilation under the arm pits, are a particularly useful and common form of ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the better women's rain jackets available to hikers, backpackers and campers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803344/arcteryx-theta-ar-jacket-womens\">Arc'Teryx Theta AR Jacket</a> - If you're looking for a <strong>good, quality Gore Tex jacket</strong> to keep you dry all day long in the pouring rain, then the Theta AR is an excellent option. It uses the <strong>high quality Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric</strong>, which is both waterproof and breathable. Features like <strong>extra length, pit zips, articulated elbows and fully seam sealed zippers</strong> are what make this one of the very best women's rain jackets on the market.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - If you would prefer something <strong>lightweight and compact for backpacking, hiking and camping</strong>, the Super Mica is an excellent option. It's a unisex jacket, and uses Marmot's proprietary waterproof, breathable membrain to keep you dry. It has the basics, like pit zips, and a few features that backpackers and hikers will really enjoy, like <strong>reinforced patches on the hips and shoulders where backpack straps will rub</strong>. A great choice for those that like to enjoy the outdoors with a backpack on.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Tarp-Poncho</a> - Another rain jacket option for backpackers, campers and hikers is a poncho. It <strong>keeps both you and your backpack dry</strong>, and you wont ever have to worry about a lack of ventilation when wearing a poncho. It's probably not what you want to wear around town, but on the trail it's an excellent choice. This particular poncho is great because it also <strong>doubles as a tarp to shelter under</strong>, ideal for lightweight backpackers looking to save weight, or those who want to take along an emergency shelter.</li>

Winter weather can, after all, be dangerous if you’re not prepared. The combination of cold and wet is a bad one, and while you should definitely enjoy yourself while winter hiking, you should also be prepared, with gear like a <strong>winter hiking jacket</strong>.
<h2>Winter Hiking Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a new winter hiking jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – When it comes to hiking in the winter you might want something more than just a shell. Insulated jackets are great because they keep you warm, but just be sure to take in to account your increased body heat from the actual hiking. Once you start hiking, even a cold day can be quite pleasant, and not at all cold as it first seemed.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – When winter hiking it’s important to have a waterproof hiking jacket. If it’s too cold for rain, and you <!--more-->just have to worry about snow then a merely water resistant hiking jacket will do the job well enough. Just be sure that you know the limitations of the fabric that you are buying.</li>

<h3><strong>Men's Winter Hiking Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>

It's the kind of thing that will keep you dry through hours and hours of snow or rain, and will insulate well enough to keep you warm.

Finally, <strong>pit zips will keep you well ventilated</strong> for those warmer winter hiking days. A well made and high quality winter hiking jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/norrna-falketind-gore-tex-pro-shell-jacket-mens\">Norrona Falketind Gore-Tex Pro Shell Jacket</a> - The Falketind is another <strong>Gore Tex 3L Pro jacket, but with a lower price point</strong>.

</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Winter Hiking Jacket</strong></h3>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779570/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> - Arc'teryx makes a number of high quality Gore Tex jackets, and the Alpha SV is one of the better ones. It uses the very <strong>high quality Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric</strong>, which is both waterproof and breathable. It also has a number of great construction details, like a <strong>slightly long length, articulated elbows and fully waterproof zippers</strong>, which help to separate it from the competition. And <strong>pit zips</strong>, along with exposed pockets will help you to ventilate the jacket when you get too warm.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/norrna-falketind-gore-tex-pro-shell-jacket-womens\">Norrona Falketind Gore-Tex Pro Shell Jacket</a> - If you want the <strong>high quality Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric, but don't want to pay the higher prices</strong> that Arc'teryx jackets usually command then the Falketind jacket from Norrona might be a good choice. It has the same basic construction as the Alpha SV, such as <strong>pit zips and articulated elbows</strong>, but has a few things that backpackers and hikers will appreciate. <strong>Reinforced shoulders and waist, for instance, along with chest pockets angled to be more accessible while wearing a backpack</strong> are both things that make this a winter hiking jacket ideally suited to those that wear a backpack while outdoors.</li>

Even simple things, like working the zipper on your jacket or tying laces that have come undone becomes extremely difficult when your fingers become stiff and clumsy. And apart from that, having freezing cold and maybe even wet fingers is just not much fun. It’s better to get a good pair of <strong>winter hiking gloves</strong> and avoid having cold, wet fingers.
<h2>Winter Hiking Gloves</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for winter hiking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – It’s a good idea to have waterproof, or at least water resistant winter hiking gloves. Things like rain and snow can saturate gloves quickly, and will make it that much more difficult to keep your hands and fingers warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a few different options available when it comes to the fabric of winter hiking gloves. Fleece is a good material, for instance, but then wool is another option <!--more-->that has a lot of points in its favour. Whatever your preference is, there are plenty of options available.</li>

Some of the better winter hiking gloves, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Winter Hiking Gloves</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-mens\">Outdoor Research Gripper Gloves</a> - These are a great choice for a winter hiking glove. They're a <strong>thin fleece glove, but include Gore Windstopper laminate</strong>, which helps to cut down dramatically on windchill. The combination of the Windstopper and the fleece also helps to <strong>shed quite a bit of water, though these are not waterproof</strong>. The palms, along with the pointer finger and middle finger are also reinforced, to weather use and abuse without damage to the fleece. A great all around choice for winter conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/819093/outdoor-research-ambit-gloves\">Outdoor Research Ambit Gloves</a> - If you would prefer something waterproof then the Ambit gloves, also from Outdoor Research, are a good choice. They're in the <strong>style of a snowboard or ski glove, with a gauntlet drawcord</strong> which integrates with your layers to make sure you don't get cold. The <strong>exterior is waterproof</strong>, and the palms and fingers are reinforced with leather, which makes them especially durable.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Winter Hiking Gloves</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-womens\">Outdoor Research Gripper Gloves</a> - These are a <strong>thinner fleece glove, but with a Gore Windstopper laminate layer</strong>, which both adds warmth and will keep windchill out. Fleece can be counted on to shed a small amount of water, and the Gore Windstopper will shed a bit more, making these gloves <strong>water resistant, though not waterproof</strong>. But if you want something that will keep your hands warm and relatively dry, these are a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/819093/outdoor-research-ambit-gloves\">Outdoor Research Ambit Gloves</a> - The <strong>style of a snowboard or ski glove, but perfectly suitable for winter hiking</strong>, especially when the temperature dips down low.

A good choice of winter hiking glove for when it gets really cold.</li>

In particular, you need a <strong>sub zero sleeping bag</strong>. Cold temperatures can be dangerous if you’re not prepared, and sub zero sleeping bags are one of the more important items needed to ensure that you stay safe. Of course you should also have other items, like a good sleeping pad, to compliment your sleeping bag.
<h2>Sub Zero Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when buying a sub zero sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Whenever you’re camping or backpacking near a lot of moisture, whether that be rain or snow, it’s worth investing in a water resistant sleeping bag. Down does very poorly as an insulator when wet, and synthetic insulation does better, but still not 100%. So it’s important to keep your sleeping bag insulation dry if you expect to stay warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – When you get in to the sub zero temperatures you need to squeeze every degree of <!--more-->warmth from your sleeping that you can, and a rectangular sleeping bag is never going to be as warm as a mummy shaped sleeping bag, just because there is less space to heat inside a mummy sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sub Zero Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best sub zero sleeping bags for cold conditions.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-expedition-800-sleeping-bag-9-degree-down\">Rab Expedition 800</a> - With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of -9</strong>, this is a great sub zero sleeping bag for that range of temperatures just below the 0 mark. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is high quality, and a <strong>waterproof, breathable exterior</strong> to keep the down dry. It has a <strong>tight alpine mummy cut</strong>, but does have enough room for you to wear a few extra layers to bed, so add a few degrees of warmth if the temperature dips down unexpectedly. And at <strong>3 pounds 6 ounces, or 1.54 kilograms</strong> it's solid, lightweight option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger</a> - This sleeping bag from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell is <strong>good down to -20</strong>, and weighs just <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, which is less, you'll notice, than the already lightweight Rab sleeping bag above. The exterior of this sleeping bag is <strong>only water resistant</strong>, however, and the down is a slightly lower quality <strong>800+ fill</strong>. Still, an excellent option if you're looking to save on weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795904/marmot-cwm-eq-40-sleeping-bag\">Marmot CWM EQ</a> - For those really, truly cold conditions, the CWM, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of -40</strong> is the sleeping bag you want. The <strong>exterior is waterproof</strong>, and the down is a decently high quality of<strong> 800+ fill</strong>. Thoughtful features like a reinforced footbox, to handle a water bottle kept warm for morning, help to separate this sleeping bag from the rest. And the impressive weight of just <strong>4 pounds 10 ounces, or 2.09 kilograms</strong> certainly doesn't hurt.</li>

But there are in fact several <strong>types of snowshoes</strong>, each with certain strengths and weaknesses, that are best suited for certain conditions. Big, durable snowshoes that are intended for trekking through the mountains with a backpack on, for instance, would not be the snowshoes that you would want to go running in.
<h2>Types of Snowshoes</h2>
The three broad categories that just about all snowshoes fit in to.
<h3><strong>Running Snowshoes</strong></h3>
With running snowshoes the goal is usually <strong>as lightweight a snowshoe as possible</strong>. Most runners don't go running in heavy boots or shoes, and most runners would also not go running in heavy <!--more-->snowshoes. Snowshoes also have a tendency to flop around, which can be a serious hamper when you're trying to maintain a good gait. So it's best to get running snowshoes that address this issue in some way.
<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race snowshoes</a> are a great example of a running snowshoe. At <strong>2 pounds 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams, you wont find any lighter running snowshoes</strong> on the market. They go so far as to use a superior grade of aluminum to save a few ounces. Atlas also has a <strong>spring loaded suspension system</strong> that helps make the snowshoes compatible with a runners gait. So a great choice if you want to go running with snowshoes on. Atlas also makes <strong>a cheaper, and slightly heavier option</strong> called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run snowshoes</a>, also ideal for runners.</p>

<h3><strong>Backcountry Snowshoes</strong></h3>
Backcountry snowshoes represent the other end of the spectrum from the running snowshoes. They're <strong>bigger, to accommodate a heavy backpack, and usually have more and better crampons</strong>, so that you don't lose traction when you're on steep, uneven terrain. Backcountry snowshoes also often have a <strong>heel lift bar</strong>, which helps relieve a little of the leg fatigue that can result from walking in snowshoes for long periods of time.

The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-12-series-snowshoe\">Atlas 12 Series</a> snowshoes are a great example of a backcountry snowshoe. They come in a <strong>variety of different lengths, all the way up to the 35 inch length, which will carry an impressive load of 300+ pounds</strong>, which enough capacity for the average person plus a heavy backpack. A <strong>heel lift bar and some solid crampons</strong> help round out the package. The Atlas 12 series snowshoes also use higher quality aluminum for the frame, and weigh an <strong>average of 4 pounds 5 ounces, or 1.95 kilograms</strong>. MSR makes another excellent backcountry snowshoe, called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascents</a>.
<h3><strong>Hiking Snowshoes</strong></h3>
If you're just interested in some recreational snowshoeing then a general hiking snowshoe is ideal. These snowshoes occupy the middle ground between running snowshoes and backcountry snowshoes. They're usually <strong>relatively lightweight, and have crampons sufficient for trails and maybe a few forays in to uncharted territory</strong>. They often lack more advanced features, however, like heel lift bars.

When it comes to general hiking snowshoes, the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 snowshoes</a> are an excellent choice. They're <strong>plastic, rather than an aluminum</strong> frame and nylon deck. Plastic has two benefits, one being that it's cheaper, and the other being that it weighs less. At just <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, these are one of the lighter pairs of snowshoes on the market in the hiking category. They also have some fairly good crampons, making them well suited to getting off the beaten trails. They will only <strong>carry a maximum of 180 pounds, but there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a></strong> that will extend that to 250 pounds."

But there are a lot of good reasons to get a waterproof pair of hiking pants, one of them being that all the water that is shed by your waterproof jacket has a habit of dripping down on to your pants, and getting them wet too. With a pair of waterproof hiking pants, however, that water will keep travelling down to the ground, rather than soaking in.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Pants</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for waterproof hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Whenever you use waterproof gear, whether it’s a jacket or a pair of pants, it’s best to have some ventilation. Waterproof materials tend to hold moisture like sweat in, rather than allowing it to escape, and you can end up wet from all that moisture that has nowhere else to go. Breathable fabrics, and even zippers along the inside of the thigh are both great ways to ventilate your legs.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Be warned that not all materials that get called waterproof are created equal. Gore-Tex, for example, is a dependably waterproof material that <!--more-->will keep you dry for a long amount of time. eVent is another, if lesser known material that does a good job of keeping you dry all day long.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Pants</h2>
A few of the very best waterproof hiking pant options, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Waterproof Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pants</a> - If you want a <strong>good pair of waterproof hiking pants but don't want to spend a whole lot</strong>, the Torrentshell pants are a good compromise. They're <strong>nylon, with an H2No barrier and a DWR finish</strong>, so they will keep water out, but these are probably not the pants you would want to be caught in a rain storm all day long in. Still, the price is right, and the <strong>benefit of nylon is that these will at least breath well</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763785/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SL Pants</a> - If you want something that's <strong>truly waterproof</strong>, then the Alpha SL pants are ideal. They use the <strong>most breathable version of Gore Tex, called Paclite</strong>, so you will stay dry but not end up with sweaty legs. And as with all Arc'teryx products you get some great small touches, like waterproof zippers, which help to make these a great pair of waterproof hiking pants.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Waterproof Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-womens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pants</a> - These are made of <strong>nylon, with an H2No barrier and a DWR finish</strong>. So they will keep you dry, up to a point. These are probably not the pants you want to be caught in a day long rain storm in. The <strong>benefit of nylon, however, is that it breathes very well</strong>, so chances are you will not, at least, get wet from sweating too much. And since these are only nylon the price is definitely right.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763470/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-womens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SL Pants</a> - If you want quality, and you want to stay dry no matter what the weather is doing, Gore Tex is a great choice. These pants <strong>use Paclite Gore Tex</strong>, which is a particularly <strong>breathable version of the waterproof fabric</strong>, which is an ideal combination for avoiding sweaty legs while working hard.</li>

Backpacking does present a few unique challenges, however, that you will need to account for when picking out a jacket. Unlike most other outdoor activities you can spend quite a few days backpacking, for instance, and you need a <strong>backpacking jacket</strong> that will not stop functioning well after just one day of rain, for example.
<h2>Backpacking Jacket</h2>
What to look for when buying a backpacking jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reinforced</strong> – If you spend enough time wearing a backpack over top of a backpacking jacket you will likely begin to notice the jacket taking a little damage in the shoulders and the waist, which are the two areas where backpack straps tend to rub. Many jackets come with these areas reinforced, to prevent this damage.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Backpacking is hard work, and you will end up sweating even without a stuffy jacket on. Which<!--more--> is why it is important to get a backpacking jacket with plenty of ventilation. Pit zips are one of the most effective areas to have ventilation, though there are other options, like ponchos, that offer more than enough ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Jacket</h2>
Some of the better jacket options to take backpacking with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - If you want something that is waterproof and will keep you dry, the Super Mica is an ideal choice. It uses <strong>Marmot's proprietary waterproof / breathable membrain fabric</strong>, which is a lightweight and compact option, making this a great option for stuffing in to a backpack. <strong>Reinforced patches on the shoulders and waist</strong> will prevent backpack straps from rubbing, and damaging the jacket, and <strong>high hand pockets are positioned to be accessible even when your backpack waist belt is done up</strong>. And finally, pit zips offer plenty of ventilation if you start overheating. A really great rain jacket option for backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803365/arcteryx-epsilon-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Epsilon  SV Hoodie Jacket</a> - <strong>Soft shell jackets</strong> make ideal backpacking jackets because they're good at just about everything. The polyester exterior will help to <strong>cut wind and shed a limited amount of rain or snow, but will also breath well</strong>. You also get a hood, with a drawcord that you can secure down when the temperature starts dipping. And finally, <strong>2 zippered hand pockets, plus a few more for storing small gear</strong> items make this a versatile option for taking backpacking. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/772278/arcteryx-epsilon-sv-hoodie-jacket-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Tarp-Poncho</a> - A poncho isn't the kind of thing you would wear around town when it starts raining, but <strong>on the backpacking trail a poncho is an excellent option</strong>. It keeps both you and your backpack dry, and provides you with far more ventilation than any other jacket could. And you don't need to take your backpack off to get it on, in fact you probably wouldn't even need to stop walking, as long as it was stored somewhere handy. This poncho from Sea to Summit uses the <strong>excellent silicon coated nylon to keep you dry, and even doubles as a tarp, for either lightweight backpacking or as an emergency shelter</strong>. A fantastic, if somewhat unusual backpacking jacket option.</li>

Socks are great, after all, but your shoes are the first and most important line of defense when it comes to keeping the outside world away from your feet.
<h2>Winter Hiking Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're looking to buy winter hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fitted</strong> – As with any pair o hiking socks that you’re going to be spending a considerable amount of time in, it’s best to get fitted socks. With a basic tube sock there’s always the potential of the fabric folding or creasing while you’re wearing them, which leads to hot spots, blisters and a whole wide range of associated foot problems.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a couple of different materials that you can find hiking socks in, but most people would agree<!--more--> that wool is by far the best choice. It breathes very well, and wicks moisture away from the skin better than most materials. Wool is also a natural anti-microbial, so your socks wont smell bad after a long day of hiking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Winter Hiking Socks</h2>
A few of the best winter hiking sock options for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Winter Hiking Socks</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/604590/smartwool-expedition-trekking-socks\">SmartWool Expedition Hiking Socks</a> - These are a<strong> blend of wool, nylon and spandex</strong>, for a fit that is stretchy, and gives you all the benefits of wool, plus a little nylon. As the name suggests these socks meant for expeditions, and are a serious pair of hiking socks. They're <strong>thick, and they're padded on the sole and the instep</strong>, to give you some padding and also protect against the pressure that mountaineering boots can sometimes put on the top of the foot. A serious winter hiking sock for serious hikers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-mens-tko0055\">Teko Merino Midweight Hiking Socks</a> - For something a little less aggressive there is the midweight Teko sock. they're a <strong>combination of organic merino wool and recycled polyester</strong>, and will wick moisture, breath well and keep your feet happy. They're midweight, so they will definitely be warm, especially if you're staying active, and features like <strong>seamless toes, padded heels and ventilation bands</strong> on the top of the sock will keep you comfortable through a wide range of temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Winter Hiking Socks</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/604590/smartwool-expedition-trekking-socks\">SmartWool Expedition Hiking Socks</a> - For serious cold you need a good, thick sock, and the Expedition from SmartWool is that kind of sock. It's made with a <strong>blend of mostly wool, with a bit of nylon and a tiny bit of spandex</strong>, which makes for a stretchy, quality fit. And since these are expedition socks, they have a few features, like <strong>padded soles and some extra padding on the top of the sock as well</strong>, to protect your feet from heavy duty boots. If you need warm, these are the right winter hiking socks for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-womens-tko0006\">Teko Merino Midweight Hiking Socks</a> - If you're not heading in to frigid temperatures, and just want a <strong>sock for general hiking in the winter</strong> a midweight option like these from Teko are likely a better choice. They will be plenty warm, but they also come with <strong>thinner areas on the top of the sock, for ventilation, and only padding in a few key areas</strong>, rather than throughout. And they're a combination of mostly <strong>organic merino wool, which is the good stuff, and recycled polyester</strong>, which makes for a great fit and feel. For most people, these are the ideal winter hiking socks.</li>

If find yourself having to hike in the rain a lot, then what you need is a <strong>hiking rain jacket</strong>. Staying dry and warm, after all, is important, and getting soaked by the rain can be frustrating when it’s warm out, and dangerous when the temperature is down low. It should go without saying, of course, that any hiking rain jacket you get should be waterproof, in one way or another.
<h2>Hiking Rain Jacket</h2>
What you should be looking at when shopping for hiking rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are many jacket materials that get touted as being waterproof, but will start leaking water through after an hour or two. Materials like 3-ply Gore-Tex have a well deserved reputation of being reliably waterproof, and others, like eVent, are an excellent choice, though not as well known.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Whenever you’re working hard you’re generating your own moisture, in the form of sweat. And <!--more-->keeping outside moisture out is great, but a jacket needs to allow for moisture you generate to escape as well. Pit zips, which are ventilation zippers under the arm pits, are a great way to let that moisture and heat escape.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - If you're going to be carrying a backpack for any significant amount of time then it's a good idea to get a rain jacket that's <strong>reinforced in the shoulders and the waist</strong>, where backpack straps will rub, and eventually damage a rain jacket. The Super Mica has that. It also uses <strong>Marmot's proprietary waterproof, breathable membrain fabric</strong>. Pit zips help with ventilation, but other than that there's not much to this jacket, which is kind of the point. It's <strong>small, lightweight and perfect for stuffing in to a backpack</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754256/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> - At the other end of the spectrum is something like the Alpha SV. It uses the <strong>high quality Gore Tex 3L Pro</strong>, which will definitely keep you dry without suffocating you. But what stands out about this jacket are the little things. Arc'teryx puts a lot of thought in to their jackets, and things like a <strong>helmet compatible hood, articulated elbows and laminated, rather than sewn hem and waist drawcord</strong>, along with as few seams as possible, are what make this such an excellent hiking rain jacket. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779570/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist</a> - If you want something in between lightweight and feature rich, the Minimalist is a good compromise. It uses Gore Tex for the outer shell, but the <strong>lightweight, breathable Paclite Gore Tex</strong>. It also has a few thoughtful features, like high hand pockets that are accessible even when you're wearing a backpack hip belt. But it doesn't have much beyond the basics. <strong>A good, all around hiking rain jacket</strong>. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">women's version</a>.</li>

Those small, lightweight snowshoes that you go running in, or walking along nicely packed trails wont cut it in the mountains, what you will need is a good pair of <strong>mountaineering snowshoes</strong>. The steep, uneven terrain that you find in the mountains necessitates a specific kind of snowshoe. If you don’t have that snowshoe, you may find yourself sinking in to the snow a lot, or else on your back a lot.
<h2>Mountaineering Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for mountaineering snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – One thing that you definitely need to pay attention to when buying mountaineering snowshoes is the maximum recommended weight. You need to account for your weight, and you also need to account for the backpack that you will likely be carrying. Getting a pair of snowshoes with attachable tails might be a good idea.</li>
	<li><strong>Crampons</strong> – The other thing that your mountaineering snowshoes should definitely have is a good <!--more-->set of crampons. You might not always have a good, solid contact with uneven ground, and you need to be sure that whatever portion of your snowshoes that does make contact with the ground can give you the grip you need to stay on your feet.</li>
</ul>

Some of the better mountaineering snowshoes to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805328/msr-evo-ascent-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo Ascent Snowshoes</a> - First up, a great pair of what are actually plastic snowshoes, not the traditional aluminum frame and nylon deck combo. Plastic is good in two ways, the first being that it's typically cheaper. Plastic snowshoes also weigh less, on average. The Evo Ascents <strong>weigh 4 pounds 1 ounce or 1.84 kilograms, but only have a maximum weight of 180 pounds</strong>, though there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a> that will improve that to 250 pounds. They also have plenty of crampons, for traction, and a <strong>heel lift bar for going up without leg fatigue</strong>. A very solid, lightweight mountaineering snowshoe.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - Something different from MSR, the Lightning Ascent snowshoes are another great option for mountaineering. They're made with a <strong>aluminum frame that has crampons on the underside, so that you get traction all along the outer rim of the snowshoe</strong>. They come with a heel lift bar, and in three different sizes, the <strong>largest carrying a maximum of 280 pounds</strong> and weighing <strong>4 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.01 kilograms</strong>. There are also <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">attachable tails</a> available to boost that maximum weight capacity, and a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 Series Snowshoes</a> - Finally, a fairly traditional looking snowshoe from Atlas. These have a <strong>high quality aluminum frame and nylon deck, and the standard heel and toe crampons with heel lift bar</strong> for going up steep slopes. They come in <strong>three different sizes, the largest of which carries a very impressive 300+ pounds</strong>. The largest size also weighs <strong>4 pounds 10 ounces or 2.09 kilograms</strong>, making them the heaviest snowshoes on the list. Still, a great choice if you like that classic snowshoe look for a mountaineering snowshoe. They also come in a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">women's version</a>.</li>

And that really is the logic for something like a hiking pillow. You can reduce your backpacking or hiking gear to just the main essentials, but if you’re not at least comfortable in the outdoors you’re not likely to have much fun. If you’re not at least getting a good night of sleep, then you’re definitely not going to be having much fun.
<h2>Hiking Pillow</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a hiking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bulk</strong> – What you definitely don’t want to do is bring along a big, bulky pillow that is going to take up a large amount of room in your backpack. It’s much better to bring along a smaller, lighter<!--more--> pillow that will provide that essential amount of comfort, but will not sprawl across the whole tent either.</li>
	<li><strong>Inflate or Foam</strong> – There are actually many high quality inflatable hiking pillows that, just like a sleeping pad, will provide you with a lot of comfort but will also deflate and pack up nice and small when you’re not using them. There are also some great foam pillows, if you prefer a foam sleeping head rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Pillow</h2>
Some of the very best hiking pillows to keep your head comfy at night.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719843/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - If you want a straight <strong>compressible foam pillow</strong>, Therm-A-Rest is the go to option. This particular pillow <strong>compresses in to its own case</strong>, which makes it easy to pack up in the morning. And it comes is a <strong>small, medium or large</strong>, depending on how much pillow you want. The <strong>medium weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - If your focus is saving on weight and bulk then an <strong>inflatable pillow</strong> is definitely your best option, and Mont Bell makes an excellent. First and foremost, the whole pillow <strong>weighs just 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>, so you'll hardly know it's even in your backpack. The top of the pillow isn't padded or anything, but that does help with bulk, and you can always throw a sweater on top of it for a little extra comfort.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-cloudrest-down-pillow\">Western Mountaineering Cloudrest Pillow</a> - The Cloudrest is actually<strong> a down pillow</strong>. By itself it's not of much use, because it doesn't offer much in the way of support. <strong>What it is useful for is a nice, padded layer on top of a few bulkier items</strong>, like a jacket or  a sweater. The good thing about down is that it weighs very little and compresses down very small. This particular pillow comes in just one size, which weighs <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>.</li>

But a <strong>hooded down jacket</strong> is a great piece of gear to have. Your head is one area of the body where you lose a large amount of heat, and so a hood can keep a lot of body heat from escaping. And when you’re too hot, you can put the hood down and allow a lot of body heat to escape, which allows you to cool down.
<h2>Hooded Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hooded down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – It’s often a good idea to get a down jacket that is water resistant, so that if you get a bit of rain you don’t have to immediately go digging for a rain jacket. Down, for those that don’t know, loses most of its insulating power when wet, and you definitely don’t want the down inside your down jacket to get wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – This is an especially important one for hikers, campers and backpackers. Higher quality down, like 900+ fill down, will <!--more-->give you the same amount of warmth that 700+ fill down would, but for less weight. The 900+ fill down will also pack down smaller, for stuffing in to your backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hooded Down Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best hooded down jackets to choose from, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Hooded Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> - If you want <strong>something to stuff in to a backpack</strong>, this ultralight option from Patagonia is perfect. It uses high quality <strong>800+ fill down</strong> for warmth, and a DWR, or <strong>durable water repellent finish</strong>, to protect that down from the moisture of the outside world. It's form fitting, with a low profile, and two hand pockets, plus one chest pocket, but not much else. But at just <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, minimalism is definitely the point.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you need something to keep you warm in just about any conditions, Canada Goose is an excellent choice. Despite the name this jacket actually uses duck down, not goose down, but the difference is negligable, and this will still keep you very warm. Features like <strong>fleece lined pockets, a fur lined hood water resistant exterior</strong> and a snow skirt all help to keep you warm and dry. This jacket has been the <strong>choice of the National Science Foundation at Antarctica's McMurdo Station research facility for the past 20 years</strong>, and with good reason.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Hooded Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> - Similar to the Patagonia jacket above with the same name, but with a woman's cut. It uses a combination of <strong>800+ fill down and a water repellent finish</strong> to keep you warm and to keep the down dry. It has a low profile, and not much in the way of features, besides two hand pockets and one chest pocket. But that's kind of the point, because at <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, it lives up to the ultralight name.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - This is a hooded down jacket for when you really, really need to stay warm. Features like a <strong>snow skirt, fleece lined pockets and a fur lined hood</strong> will all keep you very warm. It actually uses duck down, despite the company name, but you wont notice any difference in terms of quality or warmth. And a <strong>water resistant outer shell</strong> will keep all that down dry, so you never stop being warm. A high quality jacket for when you really need to stay warm.</li>

Even people with especially wide feet should have little trouble finding a pair of snowshoes that fits their extra wide shoes or boots. But one thing that you do need to get right when buying a pair of snowshoes is getting a size big enough to accommodate your weight. Depending on how much you weigh, you will want to pay attention to <strong>sizing snowshoes</strong> to fit your weight.
<h2>Sizing Snowshoes</h2>
What you need to know for properly sizing snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Your Weight</strong> – First, you need to establish how much you weigh, which you should hopefully have a good idea of. Snowshoes allow you to walk across the snow by spreading your weight over a large enough space that the snow can support it. But if there’s too much weight over too small an area, the snow wont hold it, and you’ll sink.</li>
	<li><strong>Extra Weight</strong> – You also need to think about any extra weight that you will be carrying. If you’re heading<!--more--> in to the backcountry, for instance, you will likely be taking along a backpack, and so you will need to add the weight of the backpack to your weight, and ­­will need to take that larger amount of weight in to account when buying a pair of snowshoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoes</h2>
A few of the better snowshoes across a range of maximum weights.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - The MSR Evos are a great snowshoe to have for a little recreational snowshoeing. They will <strong>hold up to 180 pounds</strong>, which is likely enough for most people, and for those who need a little more capacity, you can get <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a>, which <strong>will boost that capacity up to 250 pounds</strong>. What's great about the Evos, however, has nothing to do with sizing. They're a <strong>plastic snowshoe</strong>, plastic being both cheaper than the aluminum and nylon snowshoes, and also lighter. At just <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, these are a respectably lightweight pair of snowshoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - The Lightning Ascents are more of a serious snowshoe, perfectly capable of heading off the beaten trail and in to the mountains. They come in <strong>three different sizes, the small, medium and large having a maximum weight of 180 pounds, 22o pounds and 280 pounds, respectively</strong>. Like the Evos above, you can also get <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">optional tails</a> for the Lightning Ascents, which will <strong>add 50 or 60 pounds of capacity</strong>. So a great snowshoe with a few different sizes to choose from if you plan to head in to the backcountry. They also come in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - The Atlas Run snowshoes have a <strong>maximum weight of 190 pounds</strong>, but the main reason they're on here is that these aren't recreational snowshoes or backcountry snowshoes, <strong>they're running snowshoes</strong>. So with these, the maximum weight isn't the most important thing, it's the design of the snowshoes, which makes them suitable for running in. When running, you're likely going to be sticking to fairly established trails, where a big part of the reason you're wearing snowshoes is for traction, more than not sinking in to banks of snow. So something else to consider when shopping for snowshoes.</li>

But with snowshoes, there aren’t too many choices. There are a few plastic snowshoes out there, but most of them are <strong>aluminum snowshoes</strong> with a nylon frame. Aluminum provides the strength and flexibility that you need from snowshoes, without the chance of breaking, which a material like carbon fiber would be more prone to.
<h2>Aluminum Snowshoes</h2>
Things you want to pay attention to when buying aluminum snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Aluminum Type</strong> – So you’ve chosen aluminum, but there are actually a few different kinds of aluminum available. Higher quality aluminums are lighter, which is never a bad thing when you’re strapping things to your feet, but they’re also more expensive.</li>
	<li><strong>Intended Use</strong> – Deciding what material you want your snowshoes made out of is one thing, but there are actually <!--more-->a few different kinds of snowshoes. Snowshoes made for running in, for instance, are quite a bit different than snowshoes intended for backcountry travel with a backpack on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Aluminum Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the very best aluminum snowshoes on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - First, a great pair of aluminum backcountry snowshoes from MSR. They use a <strong>high quality, aircraft grade aluminum</strong>, to give you both strength and as little weight as possible. They come in <strong>three different sizes, the largest with a maximum weight capacity of 280 pounds</strong>, and <strong>weighing 4 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.01 kilograms</strong>. There's also an <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">optional tail</a> that will improve that maximum weight, and a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">women's version</a>. So lots of options in a high quality aluminum snowshoe.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/822407/tubbs-wilderness-25-snowshoes\">Tubbs Wilderness Snowshoes</a> - Another aluminum snowshoe, this one from Tubbs. It's a fairly average <strong>hiking snowshoe</strong>, and uses the standard quality aluminum for the frame. It uses the <strong>basic combination of toe and heel crampons</strong>, which are carbon steel, and will hold a <strong>maximum of 200 pounds</strong>, though there is a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/822498/tubbs-wilderness-30-snowshoes\">larger men's size</a> that will hold more, as well as a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/822501/tubbs-wilderness-21-snowshoes-womens\">21 inch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/822502/tubbs-wilderness-25-snowshoes-womens\">25 inch</a> women's version. So a good, durable hiking snowshoe.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - If you want to run in your snowshoes, then these are a fantastic pair of running snowshoes. They <strong>weigh just 2 punds 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams</strong>, and part of what helps them weigh so little is a superior quality of aluminum that weighs less without sacrificing strength. The <strong>maximum weight for these is 190 pounds</strong>, and they have just the minimum for crampons, so they're good for running or some light hiking. But if you want running snowshoes, there aren't any better.</li>

Synthetic filled jackets can be great, especially when things get wet outside, but <strong>down filled jackets</strong> have a couple of things going for them that synthetic jackets just don’t. For instance, you had a down jacket and a synthetic jacket, both of which provided the same amount of warmth, the down jacket would weigh less. It would also compress down better than the synthetic jacket.
<h2>Down Filled Jackets</h2>
Things to be aware of when buying a new down filled jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fill Number</strong> - The fill number refers to the quality of the down. A 900+ fill down jacket, for instance, is using higher quality down than a 700+ fill down jacket is. The 700+ fill down jacket is good, but the 900+ fill down jacket will be lighter and more compressible, assuming everything else is equal.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is a fairly standard feature on most kinds of jackets, but less so on down jackets. This is <!--more-->in part because it’s not a good idea to get a down jacket wet, and a big part of the reason for a hood on a jacket is for when it rains. But a hood can also provide warmth, which is something down is especially good at doing.</li>
</ul>

Some of the better down filled jackets, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Down Filled Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you're looking for something for around town, or perhaps a little activity in the coldest of conditions, then Canada Goose is a good choice. The company actually <strong>uses duck down, not goose down</strong>, but there's plenty of it stuffed in to this jacket, to give it maximum warmth. In fact this jacket has been the <strong>first choice at the National Science Foundation at Antarctica's McMurdo Station research facility for the last 20 years</strong>. So what it does really well is keep you warm, and features like <strong>fleece lined pockets and a fur lined hood</strong> help to do that. It's not cheap, but high quality jackets never are.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Parka</a> - If you had <strong>something lighter and smaller</strong> in mind, for backpacking or hiking perhaps, then this jacket from Patagonia is another excellent choice. It uses very <strong>good quality 800+ fill down</strong>, and includes a few essential extras, like a <strong>hood, two zippered hand pockets, a zippered chest pocket</strong> and a water repellent exterior. But beyond that there's not much, which helps this jacket to weigh an impressive <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, which is perfect for stuffing in to a backpack.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - First, a <strong>warm, well built jacket from Canada Goose</strong>. If you plan to be out in really cold temperatures you need something like this jacket. Features like <strong>fleece lined pockets, a water resistant exterior and a fur lined hood</strong> are what make this jacket such an excellent choice for cold temperatures.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Parka</a> - If you're not interested in surviving arctic temperatures and want something better suited to backpacking, hiking or just a colder day around town, then this option from Patagonia is ideal.

Those that expect to be getting rained on will want a certain kind of fleece jacket, and those that want a fleece jacket for something to stay warm in while being active outside will need an entirely different kind of fleece jacket if they expect the best performance possible.
<h2>Best Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood can be an extremely useful feature to have on just about any jacket. A fleece hood wont do much to keep your head dry, but it will at least do a lot to keep your head warm. So a hood can be a good option if you’re looking for a fleece jacket that will perform in a wide variety of temperatures.</li>
	<li><strong>Windproof</strong> – Many fleece jackets come with a hardened outer surface. The point of this is that the hardened <!--more-->surface cuts down quite a bit on wind chill, without compromising the fleece’s ability to breath, which can be a handy thing to have if you expect to be out in the wind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Fleece Jacket Reviews</h2>

<h3><strong>Best Fleece Jacket for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - When it comes to fleece jackets for those that like to stay active in the outdoors there are few better than the R1 Hoodie.  It has a <strong>half length zipper and a hood</strong>, as the name suggests. And while it doesn't have any hand pockets, it does have one zippered chest pocket and thumb holes on the end of either sleeve. It uses <strong>lightweight 100 weight fleece, and is hardened on the outside</strong>, to resist wind, but has grids cut in to the fleece on inside, to provide a nice <strong>balance of wind resistance and breathability</strong> which people who like to stay active ill appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785468/mountain-hardwear-monkey-man-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Fleece Jacket</a> - Another fleece jacket, this one using the <strong>much thicker 300 weight fleece</strong>. The outside isn't hardened, for wind protection, but the jacket is designed to be kind of furry, which gives it a thickness that is hard for wind to penetrate, and that keeps you nice and warm inside. <strong>One zippered chest pocket and two zippered hand pockets</strong> round out the features for this jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Fleece Jacket for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-shadow-hooded-fleece-jacket-womens\">Rab Shadow Hooded Fleece Jacket</a> - If you like to stay active, then the Rab Shadow is a great choice. It uses the <strong>thinner 100 weight fleece, but has a hardened outer surface</strong>, which makes it a solid combination of breathable and wind resistant. It has <strong>a hood, and two zippered hand pockets that are raised up</strong>, so that they're fully accessible when wearing a backpack with the hip belt done up. A fantastic fleece jacket to stay active in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Woman Fleece Jacket</a> - If you're more concerned about staying warm, this fleece jacket uses the <strong>much thicker 300 weight fleece</strong>.

Hiking in the summer, when you don’t need a jacket, is fun, but there are three other seasons in the year, most of which require that you have a hiking jacket to really enjoy. <strong>Hiking jackets for men</strong> and women come in a variety of different shapes and sizes, with all kinds of different features, but the most versatile kind of jacket to take hiking is likely going to be a soft shell jacket.
<h2>Hiking Jackets for Men</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hiking jackets for men.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – It can be good, depending on where you live and what time of the year you’re going hiking, to have a waterproof hiking jacket. A jacket usually means it’s cold outside, and you definitely do not want to be cold and wet. Even a water resistant jacket is a great deal better than nothing.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – When it comes to jackets, many have hoods, though there are some without. If it’s cold out, or if you <!--more-->expect to be getting wet, a hiking jacket with a hood can make a lot of sense, both to trap body heat escaping from your head and to protect your head from getting wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Jackets for Men</h2>
Some of the very best hiking jackets for men, in a few different varities.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - The R1 is <strong>more sweater than jacket</strong>, but it definitely gets the job done, and is a great piece of gear for hiking in. The <strong>zipper is half length, and there's a hood</strong>, for a maximum range of temperatures. The outside of the fleece is hardened, to make it wind resistant, but it also uses the <strong>thinner 100 weight fleece</strong>, and has a grid cut in to the fleece on the inside, so you get a nice mix of breathability and warmth. And features like a zippered chest pocket and thumb holes in the sleeves don't hurt either.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/788626/arcteryx-gamma-mx-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Gamma MX Jacket</a> - A <strong>soft shell jacket</strong> often makes for an ideal hiking jacket. This particular jacket from Arc'teryx has a <strong>durable water repellent finish</strong>, to shrug off light amounts of rain with ease. It's also <strong>great in a windstorm, and breathes well</strong>, and has plenty of pocket space. It's the <strong>kind of jacket that doesn't do any one thing extremely well, but does everything fairly well</strong>. A perfect hiking jacket if you want something versatile.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - If you're looking for something waterproof, on the other hand, the Super Mica is a fantastic choice for hiking, especially if you like to carry a backpack. The <strong>shoulders and waist both have reinforced patches</strong>, so that your backpack straps wont damage the jacket with too much rubbing. It's also <strong>waterproof, but uses Marmot's waterproof membrain, which is lightweight and folds down well</strong>, so that you can stuff this in to a backpack and take up a minimal amount of room doing it. And features like <strong>pit zips and extra high pockets</strong>, for easy access when your hip belt is done up, are just a few more things that hikers and backpackers will appreciate.</li>

But down jackets can also be expensive. There are plenty of sales, of course, but if you really want to save money on your down jacket, it can help to know what you need to look for when you’re doing your research. There is definitely such a thing as a good cheap down jacket, you just have to know what to look for when buying <strong>cheap down jackets</strong>, to make sure that you don’t end up getting something of poor quality.
<h2>Cheap Down Jackets</h2>
Some things to look for when shopping for cheap down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Generally, higher quality down will raise the price of the jacket. 900+ fill down will be more expensive than 700+ fill down. The benefit of that higher quality down is that it will weigh less, relative to the warmth you get, and will compress better. But if you’re not too concerned about those things, there’s nothing wrong with getting the lower quality down.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is a useful thing to have on a down jacket, as it keeps warmth in. On the other hand, a down jacket is a poor choice when it<!--more--> starts raining, which is precisely the situation that a hood is often useful for. So getting a down jacket can be a smart move, as long as you can find something else to wear on your head for warmth, and not getting a hood will generally also save you some money.</li>

<h3><strong>Men's Cheap Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/771737/marmot-zeus-down-jacket-mens\">Marmot Zeus Down Jacket</a> - The Zeus uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, which is certainly a respectable quality of down, and a <strong>water resistant finish</strong> on the exterior as well, which is important to keep the down dry. It also has two zippered hand pockets for keeping your fingers warm. What it doesn't have is a hood or a zippered chest pocket, which you will find on many other jackets. Still, a very good, basic down jacket with a respectable price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Jacket</a> - Mont Bell is well known for making excellent down products, and have a whole range of down jackets, this being one of the cheaper ones. It's much the same jacket as the Zeus above, with <strong>800+ fill down, a DWR finish and two zippered hand pockets, with no chest pocket or hood</strong>. This is several ounces lighter than the Zeus, however, which is something to think about. The parka version of this jacket, which is the same thing but with a hood, also won a Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award in 2011, so a good, quality down jacket with a lower price.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Cheap Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/802466/marmot-venus-down-jacket-womens\">Marmot Venus Down Jacket</a> - A good, basic down jacket from Marmot with a respectable price. You do get <strong>two zippered pockets for your hands, as well as 800+ fill down and a water resistant finish</strong> on the outside, to keep the down dry. What you don't get is a  hood or a zippered chest pocket, which many down jackets often come with. So a good, if basic cheap down jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-jacket-womens\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Jacket</a> - This jacket from Mont Bell has basically the same design as the Venus above. <strong>Two zippered hand pockets, 800+ fill down and a water resistant finish</strong>, but no hood and no zippered chest pocket. This jacket does, however, weigh less, which might be of interest to backpackers and hikers.</li>

If you know a bit about fleece jackets, and a little about what you want your fleece jacket to do, then you can likely find a cheap fleece jacket that’s just right for you.
<h2>Cheap Fleece Jackets</h2>
Some things to look at when trying to find cheap fleece jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is a useful feature to have on a fleece jacket, particularly if you want your fleece jacket to have a wide range of applicability when it comes to temperatures. A hood will hold a lot of body heat in, and keep you warm. But then so will a good winter hat, and if you already have one, or are planning to get one, a hood on your fleece jacket might be unnecessary.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Many fleece jackets come with an outer surface that has been put through a process that hardens it, so that the jacket will better stand <!--more-->up to wind chill. But if you’re not planning on being out in the wind, or if you have another wind jacket of some sort that you can layer, then there’s no sense in paying for this feature that you wont need.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814743/rei-woodland-fleece-jacket-mens\">REI Woodland Fleece Jacket</a> - The Woodland is a decent fleece jacket at a very respectable price. The REI brand is a great brand to go to when you want cheaper outdoor gear. It uses <strong>200 weight fleece</strong>, which is the second heaviest, and a good choice for staying warm. It has a <strong>full front zip and two zippered hand pockets</strong>. What it doesn't have is a hood or a hardened outer surface, so perhaps not the best choice for outings in the wind. Still, you cant beat the price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-tka-100-texture-cap-rock-full-zip-jacket-mens\">The North Face TKA 100 Texture Cap Rock Jacket</a> - This is a <strong>thinner, 100 weight fleece</strong> that has more of a technical, fitted look to it. It's a <strong>full zip, and gives you two zippered hand pockets</strong> as well as a zippered chest pocket, which is ideal for storing a few essentials that you don't want to lose. So a thinner option, but also more breathable, and better suited to staying active outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Cheap Fleece Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/826371/rei-woodland-jacket-womens\">REI Woodland Fleece Jacket</a> - You're not likely find many fleece jackets with a price lower than this one. For your money you get a <strong>200 weight fleece jacket, 200 weight being the second heaviest weight</strong>, and so a fairly warm option. Which is good, because the outside of this jacket isn't hardened, and wont do quite as good a job of blocking the wind as another, hardened jacket would. But it's a<strong> full zip jacket with two zippered hand pockets and no hood</strong>. A solid choice for around town and maybe some more active outdoor pursuits as well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-tka-100-microvelour-glacier-zip-fleece-pullover-womens\">The North Face TKA 100 Microvelour Glacier Pullover</a> - This is a <strong>lighter, 100 weight fleece jacket</strong>. The lower weight means it <strong>will breath better, but it's not windproof</strong>, and will let the wind chill in, being a thinner option. Still, it's a good fleece jacket to stay active in at the cheaper price point. There's no hood and also no pockets, so a fairly basic option, but definitely a cheap fleece jacket.</li>

Many people ignore soft shell jackets because they’re not especially good for any one thing. But that is precisely the strength of a good men’s or <strong>women’s soft shell jacket</strong>. A soft shell jacket isn’t excellent at any one thing, but it’s good at a whole bunch of things. The best soft shell jacket will keep you dry in wet conditions, warm when it’s windy, and will breath when you get sweaty.
<h2>Women’s Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
What to try and find when buying a new women's soft shell jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is by no means a necessary feature to have on a soft shell jacket, but it can be a really useful feature to have. The most important thing a hood will do for you is come in handy when things get really cold, and just a jacket is not going to cut it.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – It’s not a soft shell jacket’s job to keep you completely dry with any kind of waterproofing, but <!--more-->many soft shell jackets are at least water resistant, so that you stay reasonably dry through a few showers or flurries, provided they don’t last too long.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best women's soft shell jackets, with a range of features.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/756509/arcteryx-hyllus-hoodie-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hoodie Jacket</a> - This is far from the cheapest soft shell jacket out there, but it does what it does very well. It <strong>won the 2008 Outside Magazine Gear of the Year award</strong>, and with good reason. <strong>It's insulated</strong>, for one, to provide a good amount of warmth. It's also <strong>water resistant</strong>, and comes with two raised hand pockets, for easy access while wearing a backpack hip belt, as well as a convenient arm pocket for a few small essentials. The feature list is rounded out with a well built hood to add a bit of warmth when things get really cold. If you would prefer an insulated soft shell jacket, this is a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-apex-bionic-softshell-jacket-womens\">The North Face Apex Bionic Soft Shell Jacket</a> - If you just want a basic soft shell jacket then the Apex Bionic is it. There's <strong>no hood, and just the standard 2 hand zip pockets with 1 zippered chest pocket</strong>. It's not particularly thick, but will keep you warm and insulated from wind chill. The <strong>water resistant exterior</strong> will also keep you protected from a bit of moisture. A solid choice for a good all around soft shell jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/aurora-pull-on-jacket-women-s\">Rab Aurora Pull-On Jacket</a> - One the more technical side of thing is something like the Aurora. It <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and with good reason. It's <strong>not water resistant, in fact it has a UPF rating of 50</strong>, for protection from the sun on those cold, clear days. The hood fits close, and would go well under a helmet. The fabric is <strong>thin and lightweight, and definitely breathable</strong>, though it retains a little wind protection as well. So a great choice for those cold, sunny days. The price is also very low too, much better than either of the other two jackets above.</li>

Every pound of weight on your feet is equal to approximately 5 pounds of weight on your back, in terms of energy expended. So it makes sense to try and find <strong>lightweight snowshoes</strong>, so that you’re not adding too much additional weight to what are likely already heavy winter boots or winter shoes.
<h2>Lightweight Snowshoes</h2>
What you want to consider when looking for lightweight snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Intended Use</strong> – The weight of your snowshoes will have a lot to do with what the snowshoes are intended for. If you intend on running in snowshoes, or sticking to established trails, then there are some great lightweight snowshoe options available.</li>
	<li><strong>Your Weight</strong> – The bigger you are, the bigger your snowshoes have to be. More weight means that the<!--more--> weight has to be distributed over a larger area, and so the snowshoes have to be larger, and this typically means that all other things being equal, the snowshoes also weigh more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the better lightweight snowshoes for a few different uses.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - If you just want the lightest possible snowshoes, then the Atlas Races are likely them. They use <strong>superior aluminum and a minimalist design to get down to a weight of just 2 pounds 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams</strong>, which is impressive for a pair of snowshoes. They're meant to be <strong>running snowshoes</strong>, but could be used on a trail for casual hiking without too many problems. They come in just one size, however, and have a <strong>maximum weight of 190 pounds</strong>, so if you're over that, you wouldn't want to use these for anything more than packed or groomed trails. Atlas also makes a slightly heavier, though quite a bit cheaper model called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Runs</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - When it comes to just general hiking, plastic is, on average, lighter than the more traditional aluminum frame and nylon deck design. These particular snowshoes weigh a <strong>very slim 3 pounds 7 ounces, which is 1.55 kilograms</strong>. They're 22 inches long, as the name suggests, and will <strong>only hold up to 180 pounds</strong>. There are some <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-denali-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6in\">attachable tails</a>, however, which will improve that to 250 pounds</strong>. So a good, basic lightweight hiking snowshoe that is also surprisingly cheap.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-evo-ascent-snowshoe\">MSR Evo Ascent Snowshoes</a> - These are the <strong>same basic design as the Evo 22s above, but with improved crampons and the addition of a heel lift bar</strong>, which makes them much better suited to backcountry travel. Like the Evo 22s, these will only <strong>support up to 180 pounds</strong>, but the same <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-denali-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6in\">attachable tails</a> will work with these as well, and will boost the maximum weight capacity up to 250 pounds. And since they're plastic they don't weigh too much, at just <strong>4 pounds, or 1.81 kilograms</strong>. And the price, when compared to other backcountry snowshoes, is very good, so definitely an excellent pair of lightweight snowshoes.</li>

There are, in fact, many excellent <strong>lightweight hiking boots</strong> that will offer all of the protection and durability of boots, but will weigh a fraction of the amount of most boots. The benefit of that, of course, is that you will only end up using a fraction of the energy that you would have otherwise used for swinging your feet around.
<h2>Lightweight Hiking Boots</h2>
What to consider when looking for lightweight hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Leather</strong> – If you want lightweight hiking boots then it’s a good idea to avoid those boots with leather exteriors. Leather is very durable, and gives a boot a great, classic look, but leather is also very heavy, and boots with full leather exteriors are rarely, if ever lightweight hiking boots.</li>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – If you want a lightweight hiking boot then it pays to get a boot with as little material on<!--more--> it as possible, and one definite area where you could cut is the top of the boot. A mid –height boot will provide you with plenty of ankle support, but wont weigh as much the taller, full ankle variety of boot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Hiking Boots</h2>
Some of the better lightweight hiking boot choices, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Lightweight Hiking Boots</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-mens\">Scarpa Kailish GTX Boots</a> - If you want quality, lightweight hiking boots you wont do much better than these. They <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and with good reason. At just <strong>1 pound 6 ounces, or 623 grams</strong> it will seem as if you're not even wearing boots. They use a <strong>lightweight Vibram sole and a Gore Tex liner</strong>, combined with suede outer, to keep your feet both dry and comfortable over a long day of hiking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780681/salomon-quest-4d-gtx-hiking-boots-mens\">Salomon Quest 4D GTX Hiking Boots</a> - These are a full height hiking boot from Salomon, whereas the Kailish boots above are a mid-length. Because of that they do weigh quite a bit more, at <strong>2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.27 kilograms</strong>. But if that extra ankle support is important to you, it's difficult not to take on a bit of extra weight. But other than that they're similarly designed, with a <strong>Gore Tex liner and a mostly suede upper</strong> to offer some durability.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Lightweight Hiking Boots</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-womens\">Scarpa Kailish GTX Boots</a> - The <strong>winner of the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, these are a seriously lightweight pair of hiking boots. <strong>1 pound 3 ounces, or 538 grams</strong> is hard to beat, though these are a mid-height, rather than full height boot. They use a <strong>lightweight Vibram sole, in combination with a Gore Tex liner</strong> and a suede exterior for an all around good fit that will keep your feet dry. If you want lightweight, these is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/806620/salomon-quest-4d-gtx-hiking-boots-womens\">Salomon Quest 4D GTX Hiking Boots</a> - Not as lightweight as the Kailish boots above, at <strong>2 pounds 9.5 ounces, or 1.17 kilograms</strong>, these are a full height boot that will give you ample ankle support. Other than that they're fairly similar to the Kailish boots. They keep your feet dry with a <strong>combination of Gore Tex liner and an upper that is mostly suede</strong>, with some mesh mixed in for breathability. A good choice if you want a lightweight, full height hiking boot.</li>

A rectangular sleeping bag liner, after all, would be a poor, likely uncomfortable fit for a mummy shaped sleeping bag. Instead, you would want a <strong>mummy sleeping bag liner</strong>. Of course the shape of the sleeping bag liner is only the first thing that you need to decide on, if you are expecting to get a good night of sleep in your sleeping bag liner.
<h2>Mummy Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Things you want to keep an eye on when reviewing mummy sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Warmth</strong> – Some sleeping bag liners add very little in terms of warmth, and are designed more to keep the interior of the sleeping bag liner clean and maybe have something more comfortable to sleep against. Other sleeping bag liners are designed to add quite a bit of warmth, and turn a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Related to the point above, there are a few different materials to choose from when it <!--more-->comes to buying a mummy sleeping bag liner. Some are ideal for providing warmth, while others do a better job of giving you a nice, clean, comfortable sleep for the night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mummy Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Some of the better sleeping bag liners designed for mummy sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/cocoon-egyptian-cotton-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Egyptian Cotton Mummy Liner</a> - Cotton is a good, if somewhat heavy choice if your goal is to keep your sleeping bag clean. The one real benefit of cotton is that most people are very used to sleeping against cotton, and it makes for a comfortable sleep. And you cant go wrong with Egyptian cotton. This particular liner <strong>weighs 7.2 ounces, or 209 grams, and will add approximately 7 degrees of warmth</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/705534/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-mummy-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Liner</a> - If you want to stay warm more than anything else, thermolite is the ideal material. This particular thermolite mummy liner will <strong>add an impressive 15 degrees of warmth, and weighs an even more impressive 8.1 ounces, or 230 grams</strong>. A fantastic warmth to weight ratio.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/premium-silk-travel-liner\">Sea to Summit Premium Silk Travel Liner</a> - Cotton is nice to sleep against, but then so is silk. The benefit of silk is that it also weighs less than cotton. This particular liner comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, but the mummy shaped liner weighs in at <strong>just 4.8 ounces, or 136 grams</strong>, which is certainly impressive, and will <strong>add approximately 10 degrees of warmth</strong>, which is even more impressive.</li>

It can be very useful, then, to <strong>compare snowshoes</strong> before buying, so that you understand what is available to you, and also what will best suit your specific needs. One of the most important things to know about snowshoes is that there are a few kinds of snowshoes available, each of which is best suited to specific conditions.
<h2>Compare Snowshoes</h2>
The three main categories that snowshoes fall in to.
<h3><strong>Running Snowshoes</strong></h3>
First, there are the small, lightweight running snowshoes. These are ideal for running in, obviously, but also for gentle trails that are ideally either packed or groomed in some way. The <strong>main feature to pay attention to when comparing running snowshoes is the weight of the snowshoes</strong>. You don't want <!--more-->to be dragging around big, ungainly snowshoes while trying to run. It just wont work.

When it comes to running snowshoes, the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Runs</a> are a fantastic choice. At <strong>2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.22 kilograms</strong>, they're respectably lightweight. Besides that, Atlas has a great <strong>spring loaded suspension system that gives you a more natural gait</strong>, so that your snowshoes aren't flopping around while you're running. They'll carry a <strong>maximum of 190 pounds</strong>, and are unisex. There's also a lighter, but more expensive version of these snowshoes, called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Races</a>.
<h3><strong>Backcountry Snowshoes</strong></h3>
At the other end of the spectrum from running snowshoes are backcountry snowshoes, or mountaineering snowshoes. The most <strong>important features to compare on backcountry snowshoes are the crampons</strong>,which there should be plenty of, to give you traction on steep slopes, and then <strong>the maximum weight</strong>. If you're in the backcountry you're likely carrying a backpack, and you need snowshoes that have a maximum weight big enough to carry both you and your backpack. Otherwise you sink in to the snow, rather than staying on top.

For backcountry travel, something like the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 series</a> will do a great job. They come in <strong>three different sizes, which are 25, 30 and 35 inches long. The 35 inch version will hold an impressive 300+ pounds</strong>, which is more than enough for most people and a backpack. The 30 inch versions weigh <strong>4 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.02 kilograms</strong>. These come with some great crampons, and crucially a heel lift bar, which helps when you're going up. And there's a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">women's version</a> too.
<h3><strong>Hiking Snowshoes</strong></h3>
If all you want to do is a little recreational snowshoeing, then a general hiking snowshoe will be a good fit. There's nothing to specific to compare when reviewing hiking snowshoes, but it's a <strong>good idea to get light snowshoes</strong>, instead of heavy ones, as heavy snowshoes will only tire you out faster.

For general hiking there are few snowshoes better than the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 snowshoes</a>. They're plastic, instead of the traditional aluminum frame and nylon deck. <strong>Plastic is a good choice because it is both less expensive and lighter</strong>. At 3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms these are an impressively lightweight pair of snowshoes. They'll only <strong>carry a total of 180 pounds</strong>, but there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a> that can be attached, which will <strong>improve that maximum weight to 250 pounds</strong>."

The most obvious difference between them would be the height. Women tend to be shorter than men, which means women also tend to have shorter legs than men. So a gaiter that reached up to just below the knee on a man might come right up over the top of a woman’s knee.
<h2>Women’s Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for women's gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – As alluded to above height is one of the more important variables to pay attention to when you’re shopping for women’s gaiters. Gaiters range in size from the kind that come up and cover most of the calf muscle, to the kind that cover just the ankle. For debris, the ankle kind is usually sufficient, but for winter, or for lots of moisture, you may want the taller gaiters.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – The other major variable when it comes to gaiters is whether or not they’re waterproof. Waterproof gaiters <!--more-->will, of course, keep the water out. But they wont breath nearly as well as something like water resistant gaiters will, so decide what your needs are and choose accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best unisex and women's gaiters out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/black-diamond-talus-gaiter\">Black Diamond Talus Gaiters</a> - A great<strong> ankle length gaiter</strong> that will do the job of keeping a little moisture and debris out of your boots or shoes. They're water resistant, so they wont keep out large amounts of moisture, but then they will also breath very well. A <strong>good, basic unisex ankle gaiter ideal for spring, summer and fall hiking and backpacking</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/801674/rei-trail-gaiters\">REI Trail Gaiters</a> - If you're not looking for waterproof gaiters but you are looking for something that is a mid-calf height, then the Trail gaiters are a solid choice. They're <strong>made with durable nylon, which will keep out small amounts of water, but not large amounts. And of course they will keep dirt, sticks and rocks out of your boots with ease</strong>. And they're unisex, so suited equally well for both men and women.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - If you're looking for something <strong>waterproof</strong>, the Crocodiles gaiters are some of the very best. They <strong>won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award way back in 1999</strong>, and have been a popular choice ever since. The upper portion is <strong>Taslan Gore Tex</strong>, which is both waterproof and durable, while the bottom is extremely durable cordura nylon, to withstand the abuse that boots often suffer in the course of using them. A seriously good pair of women's gaiters for serious outdoor conditions.</li>

The reason for this is that fleece material, on its own, doesn’t do a particularly good job of cutting the wind down. In fact, your average fleece jacket will let quite a bit of wind chill through, making you cold. But a fleece jacket with a hardened outer surface is a <strong>windproof fleece jacket</strong>. Just that simple process of hardening the outer surface can make even a fairly thin fleece jacket a perfect solution to a windy day.
<h2>Windproof Fleece Jacket</h2>
What you want to see when looking for a windproof fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hardened Surface</strong> – As alluded to above, for a fleece jacket to be windproof it will have a hardened outer shell, which is what makes a fleece jacket windproof. This hardening is, fortunately, a fairly common feature to find on a fleece jacket, because no one likes to suffer from a bad wind chill.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – A hardened outer surface is the most important part of what makes a fleece jacket windproof, but <!--more-->a thick fleece jacket will, obviously, keep out more wind than a thin fleece jacket. So if you want a windproof fleece jacket, a really thick fleece jacket is another way to do it. The benefit of a thick fleece jacket is that it will keep you toasty warm too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Windproof Fleece Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best windproof fleece jackets, for men and women as well.
<h3><strong>Men's Windproof Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hooded Jacket</a> - The Hyllus is a<strong> feature rich, wind resistant</strong> fleece jacket from Arc'teryx. It has a few features, like a <strong>water resistant exterior</strong> and a good, that make it an excellent option for getting out in just about any conditions. It also uses <strong>300 weight fleece</strong>, which is the thick stuff, you can be sure you will stay nice and warm inside this jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/817991/mountain-hardwear-mountain-tech-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Mountain Tech Jacket</a> - The Mountain Tech jacket is a thinner fleece, but is made with a particularly <strong>dense fleece and then finished with a soft shell finish, which makes it a fully windproof option</strong> ideal for ugly weather. There's no hood, but two zippered hand pockets and one zippered chest pocket which are great options to have.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Windproof Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-softshell-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hooded Jacket</a> - The Hyllus is a thick, feature rich fleece jacket from Arc'teryx. The combination of <strong>heavy, 300 weight fleece and soft shell exterior</strong> make it wind resistant, as well as water resistant, so ideal for a whole range of weather conditions. There's also a <strong>hood, as well as 2 zippered hand pockets and 1 zippered pocket on the chest</strong>. A great fleece jacket to have when things get cold.</li>

The best snowshoes can make your snowshoeing experience a really enjoyable experience, in a couple of different ways. Of course part of having a good snowshoeing experience is knowing what snowshoes will give you the best experience. Snowshoes intended for running, for instance, will make for a rather poor experience in the backcountry with a fully loaded backpack.
<h2>Top Rated Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the top rated snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Materials</strong> – Depending on what the snowshoes are intended for, the top rated snowshoes will often use specific materials. There are different qualities of aluminum, for instance, that make for a better snowshoe, which will be noticeably lighter, which will improve your snowshoeing experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Use</strong> – One of the most important things to know when buying snowshoes is that there are actually <!--more-->a couple of different kinds of snowshoes. Getting the top rated running snowshoes, for instance, wont do you very much good if what you want to do is head in to the backcountry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Top Rated Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the very best, top rated snowshoes on the market, in a few different categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - In the running snowshoes category, one of the top rated snowshoes are the Atlas Runs. They're <strong>very lightweight, at just 2.7 pounds, or 1.22 kilograms for the pair</strong>. And so you don't end up tripping over your own feet while trying to run in them, they include <strong>Atlas' spring loaded suspension system</strong>, which helps you maintain a proper gait. There's also a lighter, though considerably more expensive pair, called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Races</a>, that have largely the same design as the Atlas Runs.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 Series Snowshoes</a> - You have a lot of good choices when it comes to backcountry snowshoes, or mountaineering snowshoes, but the 12 Series, also from Atlas, is definitely one of the top rated. They come in a <strong>25 inch, 30 inch and 35 inch length, the 35 inch holding an impressive 300+ pounds</strong>. They use high quality, lightweight aluminum but with plenty of crampons and such a large size they're not the lightest snowshoes around. The <strong>medium weighs 4.46 pounds, or 2.02 kilograms</strong>. And there's a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">women's version</a> too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - If all you want to do is a little light hiking with friends and family, then the Evo 22 snowshoes are ideal. They're not the metal frame with nylon deck kind, they're one big piece of plastic. The <strong>good thing about plastic is that it both costs less and weighs less than the metal frame snowshoes</strong>. At <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, these are a great, lightweight pair of general hiking snowshoes. They will <strong>only hold 180 pounds, but you can attach some <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a></strong> and improve that to 250 pounds.</li>

A random pair from the closet will work, but not nearly as well as a real pair of hiking socks. In fact, the best <strong>hiking socks for men</strong> and women are often the kind of thing that you can just bring one or two pairs, and wear them day after day, without any discomfort, and maybe just a little bit of a bad smell. Which is something that definitely could not expect a pair of socks from the closet to do.
<h2>Hiking Socks for Men</h2>
What to look at when buying new hiking socks for men.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The first and most important decision to make when it comes to hiking socks is the material. Wool is, of course, the obvious choice for hiking socks. It breathes very well, and retains its ability to insulate even when it gets wet, which can be critical when the weather gets bad and your feet get wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Venting</strong> – Even on hiking socks, many come with venting options. Often, hiking socks will have thinner<!--more--> patches, at the base of the toes, for instance, and along the top of the foot. This way, air can circulate better through the sock and against your feet, which helps to reduce any sweat from your feet.</li>
</ul>

If you want to keep your sleeping bag clean, for instance, then there are some great, lightweight sleeping bag liners that will do just that. Similarly, there are many sleeping bag liners that will add as much warmth as possible to your sleeping bag, without adding any unnecessary weight.
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
What to look at when reviewing sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Shape is an easy but important thing to get straight when buying a sleeping bag liner. If you have a mummy shaped sleeping bag, for instance, a rectangular shaped sleeping bag liner will only bunch and tangle inside of your sleeping bag, and will definitely not help you get to sleep.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There is a whole wide selection available when it comes to the material of your sleeping bag liner. If<!--more--> you want warmth, for example, then the best sleeping bag liner material for you will likely be thermolite, which adds a whole lot of warmth without adding too much bulk or weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Liners Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the very best sleeping bag liners, across a range of choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708744/cocoon-silk-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Silk Mummy Liner</a> - <strong>Silk is a great material for keeping your sleeping bag clean without adding much weight</strong>.

The whole thing <strong>weighs 4.7 ounces, or 130 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/cocoon-egyptian-cotton-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Egyptian Cotton Mummy Liner</a> - Cotton is another good choice if you're looking for something that will keep the inside of your sleeping bag clean. It's another material that feels a lot better against your skin than the interior of the average sleeping bag. This one is <strong>mummy shaped</strong>, and weighs in at <strong>7.4 ounces, which is 209 grams</strong>, and you can <strong>expect roughly 7 degrees of warmth</strong> to be added to your sleeping bag.</li>

But there’s no reason you have to give up running outside, just because there’s snow on the ground. Running snowshoes are the ideal solution. The <strong>best running snowshoes</strong> will make it seem like you’re not even wearing snowshoes, except for the part you glide over the surface of the snow, rather than sinking in to it and having to slog through it.
<h2>Best Running Snowshoes</h2>
What to look at when you're looking for the best running snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – You probably wouldn’t wear big, heavy boots to go running, and by the same logic, it would be a bad idea to wear big, heavy snowshoes to go running in. The best running snowshoes are, all other things being equal, the lightweight snowshoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Natural Gait</strong> – Snowshoes are big and bulky. Even the small, lightweight ones are rather large. So it helps if <!--more-->the running snowshoes that you get have some sort of construction technique or technology that helps them not interfere with your natural gait, and keeps you running smoothly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Running Snowshoes Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a few of the very best running snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805232/atlas-run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - First up, a very solid pair of running snowshoes from Atlas. They're not the lightest pair on the market, but they're close, and they don't even use the lighter, higher quality aluminum, which makes them a <strong>relatively cheap, lightweight pair of running snowshoes</strong>. Specifically, they <strong>weigh in at 2 pounds 11 ounces, which is 1.21 kilograms</strong>. They carry a <strong>maximum of 190 pounds</strong>, and more importantly, use Atlas' spring loaded suspension system, which helps you to maintain a good, flowing gait, which is no easy thing when running with snowshoes strapped to your feet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/rnr-22-snowshoes\">Kahtoola Rnr 22 Snowshoes</a> - Another very solid pair of running snowshoes, this time from Kahtoola. They're a combination of aluminum frame and nylon deck, just like the Atlas Runs. What's different about these is they have an <strong>elevated front toe, instead of a fancy suspension system</strong> to make sure that you don't trip over your own feet. They <strong>weigh in at 2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.27 kilograms</strong>, so fairly comparable to the Atlas Runs.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - The Atlas Race snowshoes are basically the same snowshoe as the Atlas Run snowshoes above, but lighter. At an even <strong>2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong> they're the kind of snowshoes that you wont even know you're wearing. They use the same <strong>spring loaded suspension system</strong> as the Atlas Runs, but use a higher quality aluminum and deck material, which is a big part of what helps to bring the weight down. The superior materials do cost a significant amount more, however. The best running snowshoes are never going to be the cheapest running snowshoes.</li>

One thing that gives eVent a distinct advantage is that it is also typically quite a bit cheaper than Gore Tex, making <strong>eVent gaiters</strong> a great choice for those that want to prevent water from getting in to their boots or shoes, but don’t want to pay the premium prices for Gore Tex.
<h2>eVent Gaiters</h2>
What to look at when looking for eVent gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Since the point of eVent gaiters is to provide waterproof, most eVent gaiters will be the kind that reach up to the mid-calf muscle or so. The shorter, ankle gaiters are typically used more to keep debris out of the shoes, though that doesn’t mean there are no eVent ankle gaiters.</li>
	<li><strong>Bottom Material</strong> – Typically, gaiters will be made with two different sections. In the case of eVent gaiters <!--more-->the top section will be eVent, while the bottom part that covers the boot will be a tougher, abrasion resistant material that will stand up better to use and abuse.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best eVent Gaiters</h2>
There aren't too many eVent gaiters out there, and most of them are made by Rab, but these are some of the better choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-latok-alpine-gaiter\">Rab Latok Alpine Gaiter</a> - The Latok Alpine is best suited for, as the name suggests, <strong>alpine and mountaineering environments</strong>, where the weather can get ugly and you need gear that will perform. Of course they will do extremely well in less trying environments too. They're a <strong>mid-calf length gaiter</strong>, and while the <strong>top section is 3 layer eVent, the bottom is 500D cordura nylon</strong>, which will help the gaiters to boot abrasion, rubbing and everything else that can damage boots and gaiters. The top <strong>uses a drawcord to provide a secure fit</strong>. So an all-around impressive eVent gaiter.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiter</a> - If you would prefer something shorter, these are a g<strong>reat ankle gaiter</strong> that will still keep you dry. They're much the same gaiter as the Latok Alpines above. They use <strong>3 layer eVent for the upper portion and then 500D cordura nylon for the over the boot section</strong>. The top also uses a <strong>drawcord enclosure to give you a nice, secure fit</strong> around your leg. About the only area where these gaiters are different from the Alpines is the height, which is just up and over the ankle. So a good pair of eVent gaiters if you don't need the full height of a mid-calf gaiter.</li>

Blisters, hot spots and moisture problems can all be common for those unlucky enough to be unable to get a good sock that works with their feet. <strong>Liner socks for hiking</strong> can often reduce or eliminate these common foot problems, however, by creating a barrier between your feet and the looser, moving fabric of your outer sock. Liner socks can also help keep your feet warm, when the temperature starts dipping down.
<h2>Liner Socks for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for liner socks for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Just as with socks, there are a few different materials to choose from when selecting a new pair of liner socks. Wool is a good choice of course, because it breathes well, which is always welcome in a liner sock. But wool certainly isn’t the only choice that you have to look at when buying liner socks.</li>
	<li><strong>Toe Socks</strong> – Many people get blisters and other foot problems from their toes rubbing together. In <!--more-->such a situation, there are toe sock liners, where each toe is individualized in the sock. This helps to isolate each toe from the next, and prevents them from rubbing together and creating problems.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Liner Socks for Hiking</h2>
A few of the very best liner socks for hiking in.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/smartwool-hiking-liner-crew-sock\">SmartWool Hiking Liner Crew Sock</a> - Wool makes an excellent material for a liner because of its ability to breath well and to wick moisture away from the skin. This is actually a <strong>blend that includes other fabrics, like spandex, that help to give the socks a stretchy, tight fit that you want from a liner sock</strong>. Wool also does not absorb much in the way of smell, so these wont smell bad at the end of the day either. A really impressive wool liner sock.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/627663/rei-silk-one-liner-socks\">REI Silk One Liner Socks</a> - These are a <strong>blend of silk, nylon and spandex</strong> which gives them the stretchy fit that you need for a liner sock. This fairly unique blend of materials will <strong>help absorb a good amount of moisture and move it away from the skin</strong>, as well as breath well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/806483/injinji-lightweight-crew-toesocks\">Injinji Lightweight Crew Toesocks</a> - <strong>Toesocks make for a very good liner sock</strong>. There are many people who get blisters and hot spots in between their toes, which is caused by toes rubbing together. And even the best liner wont prevent your toes from rubbing together, unless of course your liners have individualized toes, like these do. These are <strong>made mostly from polyester CoolMax, which breathes very well and keeps your feet free of moisture</strong>. So a good liner sock, especially if you get toe problems.</li>

Something like a <strong>0 degree down sleeping</strong> will keep you warm down to that very low temperature while only taking up a minimal amount of room in your backpack and contributing only a minimal amount of weight, which are the two big advantages of using down. But before you get a 0 degree down sleeping bag you will likely want to do your research and think hard about a few specific features.
<h2>0 Degree Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a 0 degree down sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – If you’re getting a 0 degree down sleeping bag then you’re likely going to be getting a mummy shaped sleeping bag. But just in case you haven’t thought about it already, mummy shaped is definitely the way to go. A 0 degree sleeping bag will weigh enough already, even with it being mummy shaped.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – At 0 degrees it might be a good idea to get a sleeping bag that is water resistant. With <!--more-->down especially, you definitely do not want to get the insulation wet, because then it wont do a very good job of insulating you anymore. So keep the down inside your sleeping bag dry if you expect to stay warm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 0 Degree Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the very best 0 degree down sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom +0 Sleeping Bag</a> - The Phantom is one excellent 0 degree down sleeping bag. There are quite a few sleeping bags with a minimum temperature of 0, and this is <strong>one of the lightest, at just 2 pounds 10 ounces, which is 1.2 kilograms</strong>. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and has a very <strong>narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>, which eliminates all unnecessary space inside the bag, so that your body heat is as concentrated as possible. It's not water resistant, but then the main draw of this sleeping bag is definitely the weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lithium-0-sleeping-bag-850-down\">Marmot Lithium 0 Sleeping Bag</a> - Another impressive 0 degree sleeping bag, this one from Marmot. It <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>, and has a few things going for it. For instance, it uses very <strong>high quality 850+ fill down</strong>, has a narrow cut and a <strong>DWR finish</strong> on the exterior, to help keep water out. At <strong>2 pounds 12 ounces, or 1.24 kilograms</strong> it's slightly heavier than the very lightweight Phantom above, but still a very good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-u.l.-super-spiral-hugger-0-down-sleeping-bag-0-degree\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Hugger #0</a> - One more very impressive 0 degree down sleeping bag from Mont Bell, which is a Japanese manufacturer well known for their down products. This particular sleeping bag uses <strong>800+ fill down, a DWR, exterior treatment and weighs in at 2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.21 kilograms</strong>. It's another award winner, this time of the <strong>2009 Gear of the Year award from Outside magazine</strong>. Besides those impressive stats, Mont Bell sleeping bags also zip together in an emergency, to conserve body heat.</li>

<h2>Socks for Hiking</h2>
What to look at when you're reviewing socks for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There aren’t too many choices to make when it comes to hiking socks, but material is definitely one of the bigger ones. Wool is the obvious choice, because it breathes well and wicks moisture away from the feet, but there are a few other very good choices worth considering as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Fitted</strong> – Tubes socks are often a very good price, but the benefits of a fitted sock are generally <!--more-->worth the extra money. Blisters and other foot problems often arise from poorly fitting socks that fold and crease, but if you go with fitted socks the chances of creases and folds happening are greatly reduced.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Socks for Hiking</h2>
Some of the very best socks for hiking in.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/phd-outdoor-light-crew-sock-men-s\">SmartWool PhD Outdoor Light Crew Sock</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/phd-outdoor-light-crew-sock-women-s\">Women's Verison</a>) - SmartWool is well known for making high quality wool products, and the PhD line is the very best of their wool socks. With these socks for hiking you <strong>get a little padding under the heel and other high pressure spots</strong>, so that your feet survive. They're fitted, of course, and use <strong>SmartWool's four way stretch system</strong>, which helps to make the fit as good as possible for any many foot types as possible. If you want wool socks for hiking you cant do better than SmartWool.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-mens-tko0055\">Teko Merino Midweight Hiking Sock</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-womens-tko0006.html\">Women's Verison</a>) - Teko is another company that makes some excellent wool products. They <strong>use organic merino wool</strong> for these socks, which is never a bad thing. And like the PhD socks above they are <strong>padded in high pressure spots</strong> on the bottom of your foot, to give you a little cushion in your step. These socks also have some <strong>thinner ventilation spots on the top of the foot</strong>, so that even though these are a midweight sock they will keep your feet well ventilated.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/711809/injinji-tetratsok-mini-crew-toesocks\">Injinji Performance Mini Crew Toesocks</a> - It would be a mistake to think of toe socks as gimmicks, because they actually <strong>solve a real problem that many people have with their toes rubbing together inside shoes or boots and creating blisters and hot spots</strong>. Beyond that, these are a <strong>synthetic blend</strong>, but do as good a job as wool keeping your feet happy. So an impressive pair of hiking socks, even if they do look a bit strange.</li>

They’re not likely to breath as well as something like a standard pair of hiking pants, but then they will keep your legs and feet dry, unlike a pair of regular hiking pants. Just be sure that you have a good rain jacket to go with your hiking pants, and maybe an insulating layer to wear under your hiking rain pants as well.
<h2>Hiking Rain Pants</h2>
What to try and find from hiking rain pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Obviously, you want your hiking rain pants to be waterproof, or at least water resistant. As with any waterproof garment you need to pay special attention to what kind of fabric or coating is being used to provide waterproofing, because some will work a lot better than others.</li>
	<li><strong>Breathable</strong> – Anyone that has worn too warm an insulating layer on their legs knows that your lower body can<!--more--> overheat quickly. Which is why it’s a good idea to get hiking rain pants that are also breathable, so that your legs don’t overheat. It’s the combination of waterproof and breathable that is often a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Rain Pants</h2>
Some of the very best hiking rain pants, for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - First up a great pair of cheap hiking rain pants. They're made with <strong>Patagonia's own H2No fabric</strong>, which will both keep you dry and breath well. Three zippered pockets are good for a few essentials, and <strong>zippered lower legs will help you get these on over top of boots</strong>. And when you don't need them, you can stuff them in to the back pocket, which doubles as a stuff sack, for easy storage.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763785/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SL Rain Pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763470/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - If you're looking for something a little more dependable, the Alpha SL pants are a great choice. They're made with <strong>Gore Tex Paclite, which is the 2.5 layer, more breathable version of Gore Tex</strong>. Like the Torrentshell pants above these have a <strong>long lower leg zipper</strong> so that you can get them on without taking your boots off. So another very good pair of hiking rain pants, especially if you would prefer Gore Tex.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/drillium-pants-men-s\">Rab Drillium Pants</a> - The Drillium pants are <strong>waterproof, but uses eVent</strong>, a fabric that doesn't get as much love as it should. What's good about eVent is that it's very breathable, which will help your legs stay free of sweat. Like the other two pairs they have a <strong>lower leg zipper, so that you can get them on over top a pair of boots or shoes</strong>. So a high quality pair of hiking rain pants, especially if you like to go at a good pace and need something breathable.</li>

A lightweight rain jacket wont weigh much, so you wont notice it all that much when you’re carrying it, and not using it. Most lightweight rain jackets also pack down quite small, so you don’t have to worry about them taking up too much room in your backpack, so that you have room for other important stuff.
<h2>Lightweight Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for lightweight rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – You want your rain jacket to be lightweight, but you also want it to protect you from rain. So you need it to be made of a material that is both lightweight and waterproof. Gore Tex Paclite, for instance, is a lighter, more breathable Gore Tex, and eVent is another material that’s definitely worth considering.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – If you’re looking for a rain jacket, chances are you don’t want it to be loaded down <!--more-->with features. But some sort of ventilation, like pit zips for instance, is essential. It can get hot if you’re staying active while wearing a rain jacket, and you want to be well ventilated, rather than sweating in to your inner layers.</li>

It uses <strong>Patagonia's proprietary H2No fabric</strong> that does an admirable job of keeping you dry without suffocating you inside the jacket and making you sweat. It has all the basics, like a drawcord hood and pit zips, but what stands out about this jacket is the price. The <strong>men's weighs 11.5 ounces, or 326 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">Women's Version</a>) - It's right there in the name, this jacket is made with minimalists in mind. It uses <strong>Gore Tex, but the Paclite Gore Tex, which is the 2.5 layer, very breathable kind of Gore Tex</strong>. And while it has the basic features, like a few pockets, pit zips and a hood with a drawcord, that's about all you get. So you get quality Gore Tex fabric but in a minimalist package. The <strong>men's weighs 1 pound, or 454 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - The Super Mica has been designed with anyone who carries a backpack in mind. The <strong>zippered hand pockets have been raised up</strong>, so that they're accessible when your hip belt is done up. The <strong>shoulders and hips have also been reinforced</strong>, so your backpack straps don't do any damage to the waterproof MemBrain material from rubbing. Best of all, however, the Super Mica weighs a <strong>very slim 9 ounces, or 247 grams</strong>, making it the lightest rain jacket on this list.</li>

More appealing, certainly, than the prospect of a heavy fleece jacket is. A lightweight fleece jacket will, in all likelihood, but a smaller, less bulky fleece jacket as well, which is another feature of outdoor gear that everyone who packs things in to a backpack can really appreciate.
<h2>Lightweight Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're trying to find a lightweight fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – When it comes to a lightweight fleece jacket, the thickness of the fleece itself is important. Thicker fleece will, obviously, weigh more and take up more room. Thinner fleece will weigh less, but the trade off is that thinner fleece wont generally be as warm as the thicker stuff.</li>
	<li><strong>Windproof</strong> – One way to significantly improve the performance of a fleece jacket without adding much<!--more--> weight or bulk to it is to make it windproof. Some fleece jackets come with a hardened outer surface, which helps to cut down on wind chill and doesn’t add all that much weight to the jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Fleece Jacket</h2>
A few of the best lightweight fleece jackets for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Lightweight Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/817991/mountain-hardwear-mountain-tech-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Mountain Tech Jacket</a> - A fleece jacket with a <strong>soft shell exterior, to help make it windproof</strong>. This despite the fact that it's actually quite thin. It comes with quite a few features too, like <strong>pit zips and a few pockets</strong>, that do add weight, but still the Mountain Tech Jacket is relatively lightweight, at <strong>1 pound 6 ounces, or 623 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - <strong>At a very impressive 11.5 ounces, or 326 grams this is lighter than even the women's fleece jackets below</strong>, and it manages that with both a hood, a hip length design and sleeves that are extra long, for the thumb holes to reach the proper spot. How it gets down to that impressive weight is with <strong>a slim fit, and tiny lines cut out of the inside of the 100 weight fleece</strong>, in a grid pattern, which helps to let the fleece breath. This is not an especially warm fleece, but it's perfect if you like to stay active outside.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Lightweight Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/809635/mountain-hardwear-pyxis-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Pyxis Fleece Jacket</a> - A good, basic fleece from Mountain Hardwear. It weighs <strong>just 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>. It doesn't have much in the way of features, but does have <strong>a few zippered hand pockets, and a fairly plush design</strong>, that will definitely keep you comfortable. But no hood and no extras like a chest pocket, are what help to keep the weight down.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/norrna-lyngen-warm-2-stretch-fleece-jacket-womens\">Norrona Lyngen Warm 2 Stretch Fleece Jacket</a> - The Lyngen jacket is surprisingly warm, with <strong>fairly heavy 250 weight fleece</strong> keeping warm. It also has <strong>a hood and extra long sleeves with thumb holes on the ends</strong>. It's also wind resistant, and has a zippered pocket on one sleeve, in addition to the two zippered hand pockets. All these features add up to a surprisingly lightweight package of just <strong>14.8 ounces or 419 grams</strong>. So if you want a lightweight jacket that will keep you warm, this is it.</li>

But like many other pieces of outdoor equipment there is a big difference between the <strong>best rated snowshoes</strong> and the rest of the snowshoes. And that difference will be very noticeable in your snowshoeing experience. The difference between a good and bad snowshoeing experience has a lot to do with the quality of your snowshoes.
<h2>Best Rated Snowshoes</h2>
What to look at when shopping for the best rated snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Intended Use</strong> – One of the more important things to know about snowshoes is that there’s more than one kind of snowshoe. Big, feature rich snowshoes intended for tramping through the backcountry, for instance, will be a poor choice for going running in, even if they’re the best rated backcountry snowshoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Materials</strong> – Aluminum snowshoes are generally better than plastic, though there are some great plastic<!--more--> snowshoes too. But even within the aluminum snowshoes, there are different qualities of aluminum that will have an appreciable difference on your snowshoeing experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rated Snowshoes Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the very best rated snowshoes for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - First, a great pair of <strong>general hiking or recreational snowshoes</strong>. These are plastic, not a metal frame, but there are two benefits of plastic. First, it weighs less. At <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, which is 1.55 kilograms</strong>, these are some of the lightest general hiking snowshoes on the market. Plastic also costs less, making these some of the cheapest general hiking snowshoes on the market, though they certainly lack nothing in terms of quality, and get great reviews. The one possible failing is that they're <strong>relatively small, and will carry just 180 pounds</strong>, though you can buy <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a> to boost that maximum to 250 pounds.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - If you want something lightweight for just established trails, or if you want to do some running in your snowshoes, then the Atlas Runs are ideal. At <strong>2.7 pounds, which is 1.22 kilograms</strong> these are fantastically lightweight, which is always a good thing when you're running. They also have a <strong>spring in the suspension system that helps you keep a natural gait</strong>, which is no small thing when you're wearing snowshoes. They will only <strong>carry 190 pounds</strong>, but then these are really meant for established trails where maximum weight isn't the most critical thing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 Series</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">Women's Version</a>) - If you plan to strap on a backpack and head in to the backcountry then you need a <strong>backcountry, or mountaineering snowshoe</strong> like the Atlas 12 Series. The series is comprised of <strong>three different lengths, 25, 30 and 35 inches</strong>, each of which has a different maximum weight. The longest, <strong>35 inch version will carry 300+ pounds</strong>, which is enough capacity for most people plus a heavy backpack. It uses high quality, 7075 aluminum to help keep the weight down, but mountaineering snowshoes are never going to be the lightest snowshoes out there. Still, despite extras like a <strong>heel lift bar and plenty of crampons for grip</strong>, the medium weighs just <strong>4.46 pounds, which is 2.02 kilograms</strong>, which is a respectable enough weight.</li>

Even if you want or need is a big, tough pair of mountaineering gaiters that will keep you dry while trekking through fields of snow, there are still some excellent lightweight options. As with all lightweight gear, it comes down to knowing the piece of gear, and knowing what options are available to you.
<h2>Lightweight Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for lightweight gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – If your goal is lightweight gaiters then you will likely want to stay away from the thicker, tougher fabric options. Thick Gore Tex, for instance, will definitely keep you dry, but there are other, more lightweight options like eVent that will do the same job, but for less weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – If your goal is lightweight gaiters then you may want to forgo the bigger, taller mountaineering <!--more-->gaiters and opt for something shorter, like ankle gaiters. This will depend, obviously, on what you intend to do with your gaiters, but it is at least an option to be aware of.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best choices when it comes to lightweight gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803452/rei-desert-gaiters\">REI Desert Gaiters</a> - If you would prefer just a pair of lightweight gaiters that will keep rocks, dirt and maybe a touch of water out of your boots, the the REI Desert Gaiters a good choice. They're <strong>definitely a smaller ankle gaiter that is actually built for shoes and smaller boots</strong>. They're <strong>nylon, which is a fabric that breathes well</strong>, and they have a <strong>UPF 30 rating</strong>, so that you wont get burned. They weigh a total of <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiter</a> - If you want just an <strong>ankle gaiter, but a pair that will be waterproof</strong>, then the Latok Mid is a fantastic choice. They're <strong>made with eVent</strong>, which is similar to Gore Tex but, crucially, lighter and more breathable. The <strong>boot portion is also made of slightly lighter 500D cordura nylon</strong>, rather than the 1000D that is often seen on heavier, bulkier gaiters. There's no weight given, but it's likely to be only a bit more than the Desert Gaiters above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-latok-alpine-gaiter\">Rab Latok Alpine Gaiter</a> - Another pair of gaiters <strong>designed with lightweight backpackers and hikers in mind</strong>. This is a <strong>mid-calf gaiter, though it's an inch or two shorter than most other mid-calf gaiters</strong>, which helps to save a bit of weight. And like the Latok Mid gaiters above, these Alpine gaiters use <strong>eVent for the top section</strong>, which is a lightweight but waterproof material. They also use the <strong>lighter, 500D cordura nylon</strong> for the bottom, which is another weight saving feature. Rab does not, unfortunately, give weights for their gaiters, but judging by the materials and design, these would be a fair bit lighter than most other alpine and mountaineering gaiters.</li>

Sometimes you just need something to cut down on the wind chill a bit, and other times you need something that wont leave you shivering in just a few minutes. Fortunately, if you know what you’re looking for, you can find the <strong>warmest fleece jacket</strong> that suits your needs. Provided that you know what to look for, it’s a simple enough process.
<h2>Warmest Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when trying to find the warmest fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If your goal is to stay warm, a hood is one of the most useful features to have on a jacket. Your head loses quite a lot of body heat, after all, and if your goal is to stay warm you just stop all that body heat from escaping and you immediately warm up quite a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – Another obvious thing that will help determine how warm you stay inside your <!--more-->fleece jacket is the thickness of the jacket itself. The thicker it is, the warmer you will stay. Related to this, a fleece jacket with a hardened outer surface will cut down on wind chill, which can make you cold fast if you don’t have something to cut down on wind chill.</li>

What to look for when you're reviewing men's rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – There is waterproof, and then there is really, truly waterproof. Something like coated nylon, for instance, will give out a lot sooner than a good, 3 layer Gore Tex. If you’re not looking to spend the money on Gore Tex there are other excellent waterproof materials, like eVent, that are typically cheaper.</li>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – Waterproof material is easy, but many rain jackets skimp out when it <!--more-->comes to the seams and zippers of the jacket, making them at best water resistant. It’s these areas that often leak water, and end up getting you wet. So pay attention to how waterproof the seams and zippers are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best men's rain jackets to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803357/arcteryx-beta-ar-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Beta AR Jacket</a> - If you want the best, the Beta AR, or really anything from Arc'teryx is a good choice. Arc'teryx puts a lot of work in to their jackets, and besides obvious things, like pit zips and articulated elbows, you also get things like an <strong>extra few inches of length, to cover the hips, a helmet compatible hood, a minimal amount of seams, and laminated seams</strong>, rather than some other inferior waterproofing. It's those extras that help Arc'teryx jackets like the Beta AR stand out. It also uses <strong>Gore Tex 3L Pro</strong>, which is the good stuff.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> - The Minimalist lives up to its name as a minimalist jacket for those that don't want to have to carry something bulky or heavy. It uses <strong>Paclite Gore Tex, which is the 2.5 layer, more breathable version of Gore Tex</strong>. And while it has the essentials, like pit zips and a hood, it lacks most other little extras and features that just add weight and bulk. This is a <strong>jacket designed to be lightweight</strong>, perfect for stuffing in a backpack when you're not using it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - The Super Mica is a rain jacket designed for backpackers, hikers or anyone else who will be wearing a backpack and a rain jacket at the same time. The <strong>shoulders and hips are reinforced</strong>, so backpack straps rubbing down damage the material. The <strong>two zippered hand pockets are also raised up, so that they are accessible when you have your backpack's hip belt secured</strong>. Finally, the jacket uses Marmot's MemBrain fabric, which is a light and very breathable fabric, ideal for those who are working hard and staying active while outdoors.</li>

Which means that the <strong>best soft shell jackets</strong> for you will depend, to a large extent, on what kind of a soft shell jacket you need. You need to figure out what kinds of weather conditions you expect your soft shell jacket to handle, and then do your research on soft shell jackets based on what you decide about what you need from a soft shell jacket.
<h2>Best Soft Shell Jackets</h2>
What to look for when reviewing the best soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – One of the more useful features to have on a soft shell jackets is a water resistant exterior. Most months that you would be using a soft shell jacket in are wetter months, after all, and a water resistant soft shell jacket will allow you to survive a few rain showers without getting wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If you want to stay as warm as possible, another good option to be aware of is a hood. A hood <!--more-->is useful because the head leaks a lot of body heat, and capturing all that body heat can boost your temperature quite a bit, and with relatively little effort. And then when you’re too hot, the hood comes down.</li>

It’s typically a lot easier to just bring one pair of <strong>camping pants</strong>, for instance, that will last and perform for the duration of your camping trip. So when you’re looking for camping pants what you want to find is a pair of pants that is versatile. Ideally, your camping pants will be as useful in the middle of the day on the trail, in the heat, as they are around the campfire at night, when the temperature dips down low.
<h2>Camping Pants</h2>
What to look for when buying camping pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Convertible</strong> – One of the more useful innovations in camping pants is the ability to unzip the bottom half of your camping pants and turn them in to a pair of shorts, without ever needing to take them off. That way you have clothing for the hot, middle of the day and also for the cooler mornings and nights.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets</strong> – Another useful feature to have when you’re camping is plenty of pocket room. Hand pockets, for <!--more-->sure, but also zippered pockets. You’re likely to be moving around a lot while camping, and the last thing you want to do is have something important fall out of your pocket and in to the dirt, where it will be very difficult to find.</li>
</ul>

They also have a <strong>30+ UPF rating</strong>, so that your legs are well protected from the sun. They're <strong>convertible, of course</strong>, and come <strong>coated with a bug repellent treatment</strong>, so that bugs will stay well away.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/771535/arcteryx-rampart-pants-mens-30-inseam\">Arc'teryx Rampart Pants</a> - If you want something easy and simple, the Rampart pants might be better suited. <strong>They're nylon</strong>, so you get all the benefits of that fabric, and they have a few extra pockets beyond the two basic ones for your hands, but there's not a whole lot else to them, other than that. A <strong>good, solidly built pair of hiking pants</strong> for those that want something minimal.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Camping Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exofficio-bugsaway-ziwa-convertible-pant-womens\">ExOfficio Bugsaway Ziwa Pants</a> - The Bugsaway pants are the best you're likely to do when it comes to camping pants. <strong>They're convertible</strong>, for starters, and as the name suggests will keep bugs away from you, as they <strong>come treated with a bug repellent</strong>. They're also <strong>made from nylon</strong>, which will dry quickly and wont rip without a fight. Finally, a <strong>30+ UPF rating</strong> will keep the sun off too.

But grinding your coffee beans is only step one. You will also need some way to turn those ground beans in to coffee, and there are a few innovative camping coffee implements that will do that for you. But before you get there, you need your camping coffee grinder first.
<h2>Camping Coffee Grinder</h2>
Find out what you need to know about camping coffee grinders.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – You don’t have too many choices when it comes to camping coffee grinders, but even so you likely want to consider the weight of the coffee grinder, especially if you’re going to be carrying your gear with you. You might also want to consider carrying pre-ground coffee beans, if you don’t want to have to carry the extra gear.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> – It will help if your camping coffee grinder works well, or is integrated with some<!--more--> other coffee making equipment, usually made by the same manufacturer. That way you can turn your coffee grounds in to coffee as quickly as possible, and get on with the rest of the things that need to be done around camp.</li>

Some of the best camping coffee grinders, plus a few other things you might need.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784116/gsi-outdoors-javagrind-coffee-grinder\">GSI Outdoors JavaGRIND Coffee Grinder</a> - The JavaGRIND is just <strong>about the only choice when it comes to camping coffee grinders</strong>. Fortunately, it's a good product. It's small and at just <strong>11.2 ounces or 317 grams</strong> you wont notice the weight too much. The <strong>bottom of the grinder has a conical shape, so it will fit snuggly on the top of a variety of different filters and presses</strong>, and the coffee beans can be stored inside the grinder, which makes packing easy. So a great camping coffee grinder from GSI Outdoors.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-mugmate-coffee-tea-reusable-filter\">MSR Mugmat Coffee / Tea Filter</a> - <strong>Once you've ground your coffee you need to turn that in to coffee, and this immersion filter from MSR is an ideal choice</strong>. It's the same basic product as an immersion tea filter, though the filter holes are smaller, to make sure you get a cup of coffee free of grounds. What's great about this is that <strong>it's reusable and makes your coffee as strong as you want</strong>. It's also very lightweight, at just <strong>1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>, and won the <strong>2009 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snow Peak Coffee Drip</a> - If you prefer drip coffee, then the Coffee Drip from Snow Peak is fantastic.

And if you’re just a recreational user you’re probably not looking to spend the kind of money that those more specialized, expensive snowshoes will cost. A good pair of <strong>recreational snowshoes</strong> will allow you to have a great time snowshoeing, without you having to make a major investment.
<h2>Recreational Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for recreational snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – If all you’re looking for is a pair of recreational snowshoes then you don’t have to worry overly much about the material that they’re made from. Most snowshoes are a combination of an aluminum frame and nylon deck, but there are also some excellent plastic snowshoes ideally suited to recreational users.</li>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – One of the more important things to be aware of when it comes to snowshoes is that <!--more-->there are different lengths, each of which have a different maximum weight capacity. If you weigh more than your snowshoes can handle you will end up sinking in to the snow, which is not nearly as much fun.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Recreational Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the very best recreational snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/11-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 11 Series Snowshoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-11-series-snowshoes\">Women's Version</a>) - The 11 Series snowshoes do well as a recreational pair of snowshoes, but are the kind of thing that you could take out off the beaten trail and do a little exploring too. They come in <strong>two sizes, a 25 and 30 inch length, the longer with a maximum weight of 250 pounds and weighing 4.58 pounds, or 2.07 kilograms</strong>. What makes them suited to a little off trail travel is a <strong>heel lift bar, to reduce calf fatigue on inclines</strong>, and a solid base of crampons, for plenty of traction.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - If you're looking for a straight recreational snowshoe the Evo 22 is a fanstastic choice. They're only <strong>22 inches, and have a low maximum weight of 180 pounds</strong> as a result, but there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a> that will boost that up to 250 pounds. These snowshoes are light too, at just <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, which is 1.55 kilograms</strong>. Part of the reason for that is that they're plastic. <strong>Plastic snowshoes also tend to be cheaper</strong>, another definite benefit for the person looking to just do a little recreational snowshoeing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/redfeather-snowshoes-trek-snowshoe-kit-with-poles-tote\">Redfeather Trek Snowshoes Kit</a> - If you want to get the whole snowshoeing experience then a kit might be the way to go. The snowshoes come in a <strong>25 and 30 inch length, the 30 inch with a recommended maximum weight of 220 pounds</strong>. You also <strong>get a pair of trekking poles</strong>, which can come in handy on uneven terrain, <strong>and a tote bag</strong>, so that the snowshoe crampons don't tear up anything when you're not using them.</li>

If there is a field of tall, wet grass between you and your destination, for instance, you will have to go through it, and in such a situation a good pair of waterproof, full length <strong>orienteering gaiters</strong> will do wonders for keeping you dry. Even just a pair of ankle gaiters will do a lot to help keep the inside of your boots dry and free from debris that would otherwise find their way down your boots or shoes.
<h2>Orienteering Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you want orienteering gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Unless you’re sure of the weather and environment that you’re going in to, it is a good idea to have waterproof gaiters with you. Or at least water resistant gaiters, which will breath better than the waterproof variety and will still keep you dry from a limited amount of moisture.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle or Calf</strong> – There are two main lengths when it comes to gaiters, the over-the-ankle kind and the mid-calf kind. If you’re <!--more-->wearing gaiters as more of a precaution than anything, and especially if the weather is good, then the ankle gaiters are likely ideal, but for bad weather, or snow, the larger, mid-calf gaiters are a better choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Orienteering Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best orienteering gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827256/the-north-face-gore-tex-gaiters\">The North Face Gore-Tex Gaiters</a> - First, a tough, durable pair of mountaineering gaiters from The North Face. The upper portion is <strong>3 layer Gore Tex</strong>, as the name suggests, which will definitely keep you dry in bad weather. And the <strong>bottom is very tough cordura nylon</strong>, which will resist damage done by things like scree slopes and boots rubbing together. The top of the gaiter is <strong>secured with a buckle and strap</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Extreme Gaiter</a> - Another pair of gaiters ideally suited to mountaineering, though these with a lighter construction. First, they're <strong>3 layer eVent</strong>, which is a waterproof fabric similar to Gore-Tex that actually breathes better. The <strong>bottom portion of the gaiter is 500D cordura nylon</strong>, rather than the 1000D nylon used on a lot of other mountaineering gaiters. Which is still a very touch nylon, but puts these in the lightweight mountaineering gaiters category. So they'll keep you dry, but are also <strong>lighter and will breath better</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiter</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - The Crocodiles <strong>won the Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice Gold award way back in 1999</strong>, and have been a popular choice ever since. They use <strong>3 layer taslan Gore-Tex</strong> for the top and very tough <strong>1000D cordura nylon for the bottom</strong>, to resist the use and abuse that boots suffer. And these use a strap and buckle system to secure the top of the gaiter to your leg. So very similar to the North Face gaiters above, but with a lower price.</li>

But once you’ve decided on a full zipper, you still have a few other decisions to make. Fleece jackets can be useful in a wide variety of environments and conditions, after all, and what you need from your fleece jacket will determine what kind of fleece jacket is best for you.
<h2>Full Zip Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking at full zip fleece jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – Fleece comes in a wide variety of thicknesses, which will do a lot to determine how warm your fleece jacket is. So if you want to stay toasty warm, a thick fleece jacket will be best, whereas if you’re looking for something to compliment your active lifestyle, a thinner fleece jacket will likely be a better choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Fleece, by itself, is not particularly good at cutting down on wind chill. If the fleece<!--more--> is thick enough it will do a good job, but if you’re not interested in a big, thick full zip fleece jacket, a fleece jacket with a hardened outer surface will also do a good job of cutting down on wind chill, without compromising your fleece jacket’s ability to breath well.</li>

For starters, they regulate your foot temperature very well. They also wick a lot of moisture away from the skin. Wool is also a natural anti-microbial, so it doesn’t smell bad at the end of the day. Finally, wool will insulate very well even when wet, so that if your feet get wet, they at least do not get cold too.
<h2>Merino Wool Hiking Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for merino wool hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – Wool socks come in a variety of thicknesses, depending on what kind of temperatures you plan to use them in. Heavyweight wool socks will keep your feet toasty warm in the winter, for instance, while thinner, lightweight socks are thin enough to breath well and keep your feet free of sweat even in the summer heat.</li>
	<li><strong>Fitted</strong> – Another feature that you definitely want to look at when buying new merino wool <!--more-->hiking socks is whether they’re fitted or not. Fitted socks typically cost more, but they also generally fit better, and will not crease or fold, which can often be the initial problem that causes a blister a few miles farther down the trail.</li>

Many will give you a great snowshoeing experience without costing a whole lot of money. That way, you can see if snowshoeing is for you, and if you want to take it any farther than just casual hiking you can always invest in a more specialized pair of snowshoes.
<h2>Snowshoes for Beginners</h2>
What you want to look at when looking for snowshoes for beginners.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – The important thing to be aware of when buying snowshoes is that every snowshoe has a maximum weight. If you exceed that maximum weight the snowshoe wont be able to float on top of the snow, and it will just sink in, which is not nearly as fun a way to experience snowshoeing.</li>
	<li><strong>Types</strong> – There are actually a few different kinds of snowshoes. Snowshoes for running, for instance, are<!--more--> probably not what you want as a beginner. The same can be said of snowshoes that are intended for backcountry travel, typically with a heavy backpack on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoes for Beginners</h2>
Some of the better snowshoes for beginners to consider.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/11-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 11 Series Snowshoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-11-series-snowshoes\">Women's</a>)- If you're looking for a pair of hiking snowshoes that you <strong>can transition to use in the backcountry</strong>, then the Atlas 11 Series is a good choice. They're not the high end Atlas 12 Series, but they do come with a few features, like a heel lift bar, that is crucial for backcountry travel. The price is also lower than the typical backcountry snowshoe, so you don't have to make a huge investment. They come in a <strong>25 and 30 inch size, and the 30 inch size with a maximum load of 250 pounds and a weight of 4.58 pounds, or 2.07 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - If you're looking for a good, solid pair of beginner snowshoes with a lower price, then the Evo 22 snowshoes are ideal. <strong>Part of the reason they're cheaper is that they're plastic</strong>, which doesn't compromise performance in any real way, and also weighs less. At just <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, the Evo 22s are also some of the lightest hiking snowshoes around. Their short length means they have a fairly low <strong>maximum weight of 180 pounds</strong>, but you can buy <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a> that will add 70 pounds to that maximum.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - <strong>If you plan on taking up running in snowshoes</strong>, but maybe want to start with something that isn't all that expensive, and that you can use for some causal hiking on trails too, then the Atlas Runs are an ideal compromise. They <strong>weigh a very respectable 2.7 pounds, or 1.22 kilograms</strong>, and while they don't have the size or crampons to do off trail very much, they do fine on established trails, and are an excellent pair of snowshoes for running in. They only <strong>come in one size, and have a maximum weight of 190 pounds</strong>.</li>

Nylon has a few things going for it, the first and most important being that it dries extremely fast. Sometimes your hiking pants get wet, after all, but with nylon you don’t have to worry about them staying wet long. Nylon also doesn’t rip easily, which is great because no one wants a big tear in their hiking pants with miles of trail still left to go.
<h2>Nylon Hiking Pants</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for nylon hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Convertible</strong> – Regardless of the material you choose for your hiking pants, it’s a good idea to at least consider getting convertible nylon hiking pants, which will further increase the versatility of your hiking pants. That way, you have options for when the temperature is high, at mid day, and when the temperature is low, in the mornings and the evenings.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets</strong> – Pockets might seem like an afterthought, but are actually worth thinking about when <!--more-->it comes to hiking pants. Cargo pants pockets, for example, will come in handy for carrying a few extras, as will a zippered pocket or two for storing essentials that you don’t want to lose in the outdoors.</li>

Hiking is fine, but backpacking goes on for quite a bit longer, and requires better, more versatile gear that will stand up over longer periods of time in the outdoors without coming apart or failing in some other way. If your pants rip while hiking, for instance, then you can just take them off at the end of the day. But if <strong>backpacking pants</strong> rip, you are likely going to have to break out the duct tape, and live with your ripped backpacking pants for the duration of your trip.
<h2>Backpacking Pants</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for backpacking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nylon</strong> – There are some good fabric choices when it comes to backpacking pants, but nylon is by far the most versatile. First, it dries quickly, which is always a great asset to have in a pair of backpacking pants. Second, nylon doesn’t rip easily, which means you can leave the duct tape and sewing kit inside your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Convertible</strong> – You can check the forecast before you leave to go backpacking, but you never know what the weather is going to be on that second or <!--more-->third day until you’re out there. Which is why convertible backpacking pants are so useful. You have a pair of shorts when it gets hot, and a pair of pants when things cool off.</li>

Many are designed just to keep the interior of the sleeping bag clean, so that you don’t have to go cleaning the entire bag in the washing machine every time you go camping or backpacking. Others are designed for warmth, and if you know what to look for, it’s not too difficult to find the <strong>warmest sleeping bag liner</strong>. Really, it all comes down to picking the right material for your sleeping bag liner.
<h2>Warmest Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
What to look for when looking for the warmest sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thermolite</strong> – There are a couple of possible choices for a warm sleeping bag liner, but thermolite is the best. It adds a whole bunch of warmth with as little bulk and weight as possible. Something like fleece will also add a lot of warmth, but will take up a lot of room and weigh a lot too.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – This depends on what shape of sleeping bag you have, but it’s worth mentioning that a <!--more-->mummy shaped sleeping bag, and thus a mummy shaped sleeping bag liner, will be warmer than the rectangular variety. Put simply, there’s less room inside a mummy shaped sleeping bag to heat at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Warmest Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Some of the best choices when it comes to the warmest sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Sleeping Bag Liner</a> - Thermolite is one of the better sleeping bag liner materials when it comes to adding a lot of warmth to a sleeping bag without carrying around a big, heavy sleeping bag liner. This particular liner will <strong>add about 15 degrees of warmth, is mummy shaped and weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, which is a very good warmth to weight ratio.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/toaster-microfleece-mummy-liner\">Sea to Summit Toaster Microfleece Mummy Liner</a> - The other obvious choice when it comes to sleeping bag liner materials that will keep you warm is fleece. This particular microfleece liner <strong>weighs 1 pound 4 ounces, or 560 grams, and there's no word on just how much warmth it adds</strong>, though it will definitely be in the double digits. So a good, if heavy option if you prefer a fleece sleeping bag liner.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797114/sea-to-summit-thermolite-reactor-extreme-mummy-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor Extreme Mummy Liner</a> - The Reactor Extreme is one of, if not the warmest sleeping bag liner on the market. It's the kind of thing you want if you're trying to use a summer sleeping bag in winter. It <strong>weighs 14 ounces, or 396 grams, and adds an impressive 25 degrees of warmth to a sleeping bag</strong>. It's <strong>mummy shaped</strong>, as the name suggests, and is about the warmest sleeping bag liner you're likely to find.</li>

Some can go for hundreds of hours on low power settings, but others will eat through a fresh set of batteries in just a few hours on the high settings. So rather than spend a fortune on an endless supply of new batteries, it can be easier to just get a <strong>rechargeable headlamp</strong> that has its own battery. A rechargeable battery might not last quite as long, but you wont have to constantly buy new batteries.
<h2>Rechargeable Headlamp</h2>
Find out what to look for when reviewing rechargeable headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – One of the disadvantages of using a rechargeable battery rather than a constant supply of fresh new batteries is that you don’t get as much battery life. So pay close attention to what the battery life of your prospective headlamp is, and whether it’s enough to get you through between recharges.</li>
	<li><strong>Power Modes</strong> – Related to the point above, it can be easy to conserve power by utilizing a lower power <!--more-->setting, assuming that your headlamp has a different power mode. Most do, but some of the smaller, minimalist ones don’t, so just check to make sure that you can conserve power when you need to with a lower power setting.</li>
</ul>

Some of the very best rechargeable headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tikka-2-headlamp-with-core-battery-kit\">Petzl Tikka 2 Headlamp</a> - This is actually the <strong>standard Tikka 2 headlamp with a CORE battery kit</strong>, which is <strong>rechargeable up to 300 times</strong>, after which you would need to get a new battery, or else you <strong>can switch to using regular AAA batteries</strong>. The headlamp itself puts out a maximum of <strong>40 lumens</strong>, and has <strong>three different power settings</strong>. The battery will go for approximately <strong>120 hours on the lowest setting</strong>. The battery is charged via USB, but also comes with a wall adapter.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796178/black-diamond-sprinter-headlamp\">Black Diamond Sprinter Headlamp</a> - The Sprinter is a headlamp designed specifically for those who will be moving fast at night. The beam is focused in front of you, so that all the light goes to illuminating what's on the trail in front of you. <strong>On low power the battery will last a total of 64, and on high you get a very good 68 lumens, though only for 5 hours</strong>. The battery itself <strong>recharges in 6 hours</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - If you need something truly powerful, the Ultra is an ideal choice. It has a rather high price, but manages to put out <strong>350 lumens on high power</strong>, which is enough to illuminate more than a hundred meters in front of you. It will <strong>only last 2 hours on that high setting, however, and 17 hours on the lower setting</strong>, so it's a good thing the batteries are rechargeable, or you would go through them rather quickly. The <strong>battery full recharges in 3 hours</strong>.</li>

There are a few different kinds of specialized snowshoes, for instance, that are great for certain things, but not ideally suited to the kind of basic trail walking that beginners are typically focused on. The <strong>best beginner snowshoes</strong> will give you everything that you need to enjoy a simple hike, without costing you a great deal of money.
<h2>Best Beginner Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best beginner snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – When buying a pair of snowshoes you don’t need to worry too much about the foot size of the snowshoes, but you do need to worry about their length, and their maximum weight capacity. Longer snowshoes with more surface area will be able to support more weight. If you weigh more than the maximum weight capacity you’ll just sink in to the snow, which isn’t much fun.</li>
	<li><strong>Snowshoe Types</strong> – When you’re starting out with snowshoes all you need is a basic hiking snowshoe, without anything too fancy. More specialized <!--more-->snowshoes, like backcountry snowshoes or running snowshoes may work fine, but will likely cost more than your basic pair of hiking snowshoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Beginner Snowshoes Reviews</h2>
Some of the very best beginner snowshoes to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - The Atlas Run snowshoes are the <strong>ideal pair of snowshoes for beginners that think they might like to transition to running in snowshoes one day</strong>. They make a good pair of general hiking snowshoes, though you probably wouldn't want to take them off of established trails. And if you do want to go running, they are light enough, at <strong>2 pounds 11.4 ounces, or 1.23 kilograms</strong>, that you wont have any problems. Because they're smaller and intended for running, they do have a <strong>maximum weight capacity of 190 pounds</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-flash-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Flash Snowshoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-flash-snowshoe-womens\">Women's</a>) - <strong>If you think that you might one day like to get off the beaten trail and in to the backcountry</strong>, then the Lightning Flash snowshoes are a good choice. They don't have a heel lift bar, which is a useful feature for the backcountry, but they do come in <strong>two sizes, a 22 and 25 inch length, the larger carrying a maximum of 280 pounds</strong>. Beyond that, what makes these a good pair of snowshoes for transitioning to backcountry travel is MSR's 360 traction system, which is crampons built in to the bottom of the outer frame. You can also add weight to the maximum weight capacity by attaching <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">optional tails</a>, so that you can handle the weight of a heavy backpack when you start venturing off of the established trail.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - The Evo 22 snowshoes are a fantastic choice for that just want something to go hiking in. They're <strong>relatively cheap, and also fairly lightweight, at 3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>. The only real drawback is that they come in <strong>just one size that will carry a maximum of 180 pounds</strong>. But for those that want to add to that, there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">optional tails</a> that add an additional 70 pounds to that 180 pound capacity.</li>

Down is a superior insulation material in a few different ways, and manufacturers who make quality products recognize this, and use down to its full potential. But even so, the <strong>warmest down jacket</strong> will have a few things going for it that most other down jackets wont. Of course if you want the best, you will have to pay a premium, but then to get the best it’s usually worth paying a little more.
<h2>Warmest Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the warmest down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Quality vs Quantity</strong> – The better quality the down inside you jacket is, the warmer you will be. Down jackets designed for backpackers and hikers often has a high quality down of 800+ fill or more, which keeps you warm without adding weight. On the other hand, if you want to stay really warm and aren’t too concerned about weight, then some jackets are stuffed to the brim with lower quality down, and take a quantity over quality approach.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – You can have the warmest down jacket in the world, but if you get the down wet you’re going to get cold fast, because down <!--more-->stops being a good insulator when it gets wet. So if you want to stay warm inside your jacket, it pays to make sure that the down stays dry.</li>

It's been a <strong>popular choice at the National Science Foundation at Antarctica's McMurdo Station research facility for the past 20 years</strong>, to give you an idea of just how warm this jacket is. It's <strong>packed full of 625+ fill duck down</strong>, and comes with a few features, like <strong>fleece lined pockets and a fur lined hood</strong>, that will keep your extremities warm too. It's water resistant, and a seriously warm down jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-men-s\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-women-s\">Women's</a>) - If you want <strong>something warm that you can also stay active in</strong>, the Alpine Light Down Parka from Mont Bell is an excellent choice. It's stuffed with <strong>plenty of 800+ fill down</strong>, and comes with a <strong>hood, along with a couple of hand pockets</strong> for your cold hands. It has a water resistant shell, and a few thoughtful features like a microfleece lined collar and a drawcord hem that will help you stay good and warm. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Patagonia Ultralight is an <strong>ideal jacket for someone looking for a compromise between staying warm and saving as much weight as possible</strong>. It's not all that thick, but it does have both <strong>a hood and a couple of zippered hand pockets</strong> so that you can keep those extremities warm, plus <strong>a drawcord hem to keep warm air trapped inside</strong>. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong> and a water resistant exterior to keep you and the down inside the jacket dry.

But an unlucky backpacker might end up spending days and days in the rain, and though no one wants to think about this scenario, you need to prepare for it. The <strong>best backpacking rain jacket</strong> will get you through those days and days of rain dry, and relatively comfortable. You will wish the weather had been better, but the trip wont have been ruined either.
<h2>Best Backpacking Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want the best backpacking rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reinforced</strong> – Backpacking shoulder straps and hip belts tend to rub, and over days and days of rubbing, can damage whatever clothing is under them. You don’t want an expensive rain jacket to be damaged at the end of a backpacking trip, so consider getting a backpacking rain jacket with reinforced pads on the shoulders and the waist.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When you go backpacking you need to think hard about what material you want. Something like<!--more--> nylon treated with DWR will keep you dry for a little while, but not over days of steady rain. Materials like Gore Tex and eVent are more expensive, but they also perform better, and are worth that extra money.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Rain Jacket Reviews</h2>
A select few of the very best backpacking rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - The Super Mica is the ideal jacket for taking backpacking, because it's designed with a backpacker in mind. First, the <strong>hand pockets are raised slightly, so that they're fully accessible without having to undo off your hip belt</strong>. Both the <strong>hips and the shoulders are also reinforced</strong>, so that your backpack straps don't rub the waterproof exterior and damage it over long periods of time. Marmot also used their <strong>lightweight MemBrain fabric</strong>, which keeps you dry, breathes well and packs down extremely small, so that you're not carrying something big and heavy. So really, the ideal backpacking rain jacket. It <strong>weighs 9 ounces, or 247 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827541/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-mens\">Marmot Minimalist</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762351/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Minimalist is a good jacket for someone who wants a Gore Tex jacket without having to carry around something big and heavy. It uses <strong>Gore Tex Paclite, which is the 2.5 layer, more breathable version of Gore Tex</strong>. Paclite is also the more packable version of Gore Tex. It doesn't have much in the way of features, which helps to offset the extra weight of Gore Tex. At <strong>15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong> it's a respectably lightweight backpacking rain jacket option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-tarp-poncho\">Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Tarp-Poncho</a> - No list of the best backpacking rain jackets would be complete without at least one poncho. Ponchos generally aren't what you would wear around town, but out on a trail they're ideal, because they <strong>will keep both you and your backpack dry, wont cause any ventilation problems and are very easy to get on and off</strong>. This particular one from Sea to Summit also doubles as a tarp, so that you <strong>can use it either as a shelter or as a backup shelter</strong>. And best of all it weighs a very respectable <strong>10 ounces, or 283 grams</strong>. So not the most fashion forward choice, but definitely one of the best backpacking rain jacket options.</li>

But a <strong>mini headlamp</strong>, while likely not as powerful as a big headlamp, has a few distinct advantages. For one, mini headlamps will weigh less, and it wont feel like you’re carrying a weight around on your head. A mini headlamp that is lightweight will add less bulk and weight to your backpack during the day.
<h2>Mini Headlamp</h2>
What you want to see on a mini headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – A smaller headlamp will, generally, have smaller LEDs, and will put out less light. So if a powerful headlamp is important to you, make sure to look closely at the lumens that you can expect from a headlamp when you’re doing your research, so you get something powerful enough to suit your needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If your main purpose in getting a mini headlamp is to save weight and end up with a lightweight backpack, then <!--more-->you should also pay close attention to the weight of the headlamp. A mini headlamp wont take up much space, but a mini headlamp is not necessarily a lightweight headlamp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mini Headlamp</h2>
Some of the best mini headlamps to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-zipka-plus-2-headlamp-ptz0263\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2 Headlamp</a> - If you want a mini headlamp, the Zipka is an excellent choice. It features a <strong>small retractable strap that makes it easy to put on and also easy to store</strong>. It will fit right in your pocket until you need it. It has <strong>three different brightness levels</strong>, the highest giving you <strong>70 lumens</strong> of light to work with, and the lowest giving you <strong>155 hours of battery</strong>. And the whole thing weighs just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong> with batteries.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791313/petzl-tikka-xp-2-led-headlamp\">Petzl Tikka XP 2 LED Headlamp</a> - The Tikka XP is a fairly standard looking headlamp that will certainly pack down small when you need it to. It will go for a total of <strong>160 hours on the lowest battery setting, and will pump out 60 lumens in the highest setting</strong>, but only for 80 hours. The whole thing, however, <strong>weighs just 3.1 ounces, or 87 grams</strong> with batteries, so only slightly heavier than the very small Zipka above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm Headlamp</a> - The Storm is a great headlamp for uncertain weather conditions, as it is <strong>fully waterproof</strong> and, as the name suggests, the ideal light source when you find yourself out in a storm. On the highest setting the Storm puts out a very <strong>impressive 100 lumens</strong>, and on the lowest will <strong>last for an equally impressive 200 hours</strong>. All the improved numbers, plus the waterproof does cost you something in weight, however. At <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 ounces</strong> this is the heaviest headlamp on the list, though not be a large amount.</li>

Fleece is very soft, and is thus a great material to sleep against at night, unlike the interior of most sleeping bags, which many people find uncomfortable and clingy. A <strong>micro fleece sleeping bag liner</strong> will also add a significant amount of warmth, and turn a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag with ease.
<h2>Micro Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Things to look for when buying a micro fleece sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – If you have a rectangular shaped sleeping bag then you will want to buy a rectangular shaped micro fleece sleeping bag liner. Trying to stuff a rectangular liner in<!--more--> to a mummy shaped sleeping bag, for instance, will result in a creased and uncomfortable sleeping bag liner.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If you really want to stay warm then it would be a good idea to get a sleeping bag liner with a hood. You lose a lot of heat from your head, which is precisely why most sleeping bags have a hood to begin with, and a fleece hood will only help to capture and reflect more heat. Plus it will great to sleep against.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Micro Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Some of the very best micro fleece sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/kelty-lightweight-fleece-sleeping-bag-liner\">Kelty Fleece Sleeping Bag Liner</a> - This is a <strong>rectangular sleeping bag liner</strong> suited well enough for car camping, but not for anything where you would be carrying the liner. With <strong>10 to 15 degrees of warmth added for 2 pounds 14 ounces, or 1.3 kilograms</strong>, you would be better off just getting a warmer sleeping bag. But for car camping with a rectangular sleeping bag, it's a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/toaster-microfleece-mummy-liner\">Sea to Summit Toaster Microfleece Mummy Liner</a> - When it comes to the limited selection of micro fleece sleeping bag liners, the Toaster is the stand out choice. It's <strong>mummy shaped</strong>, and is the only fleece liner that is actually specifically micro fleece. There's <strong>no exact data on just how much warmth you can expect</strong>, but it's sure to be in the double digits at the very least. A <strong>contoured head with drawcord</strong> will certainly help keep you warm, at least. At <strong>1 pound 4 ounces, or 560 grams</strong> it's not the lightest sleeping bag liner in the world, but it's not bad either.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797114/sea-to-summit-thermolite-reactor-extreme-mummy-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor Extreme</a> - If you're looking to add warmth to your sleeping bag and assumed that fleece was the best choice, you would be wrong. <strong>Thermolite is a similar fabric that does a far better job of adding warmth to your sleeping bag</strong>. For <strong>14 ounces, or 390 grams you get an impressive 25 degrees of warmth</strong>, which is a far better warmth to weight ratio than you could expect from fleece. So if you want to stay warm, consider thermolite over fleece.</li>

Of course the big glass coffee pot that you use at home is not ideal for taking camping, for a number of reasons. What you need is a coffee pot that is more durable, and possibly even a coffee pot for camping that doubles as a pot for cooking, to save on weight and bulk.
<h2>Coffee Pots for Camping</h2>
What you want to pay attention to when reviewing coffee pots for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> – It helps if your coffee pot for camping is more than just a coffee pot. A coffee pot that doubles as a cooking pot, for instance, is a more useful piece of gear. It also helps if your coffee pot is integrated with whatever else you’re using to make your coffee, like a French press, for instance.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Another thing that you definitely want to pay attention to is the material that your<!--more--> camping coffee pot is made out of. Most pots will be made of metal of one sort or another, but even within the metal category, there are a wide variety of choices. Titanium is lightweight and strong, for instance, but also quite expensive compared to other metals like aluminum or stainless steel.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Coffee Pots for Camping</h2>
Some of the very best coffee pots for camping with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/litech-coffee-press-kit\">Primus LiTech Coffee / Tea Press Kit</a> - The LiTech is a <strong>combination of pot and press</strong>, so that you have a coffee pot for camping, as well as a way to make coffee inside the pot. The good thing about this set is that the pot, which <strong>will hold a total of 1 liter, can also double as a cooking pot</strong>, so that you can use just one pot for everything, which is ideal for camping. The pot itself has foldable handles, and is <strong>made of aluminum</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 9.8 ounces, or 277 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401016/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-coffee-pot\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Coffee Pot</a> - If you're looking for a straight coffee pot for camping, then baked enamel is a good choice. This particular pot from GSI will <strong>hold 1.9 liters of liquid</strong>, which is enough for a few cups of coffee at least, and is a <strong>stainless steel core with baked enamel coating</strong> it. It <strong>weighs 1 pound 5 ounces or 595 grams</strong>, however, so not the lightest option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - The Cafe Press is another <strong>combination of pot and press</strong>, so that you can hold your coffee and make it too, all in the same piece of gear. The pot <strong>holds .7 liters</strong>, and like the Primus pot / press combo above, the pot can also <strong>double as a cooking pot</strong>, so that you don't have to bring a second pot for that. Unlike the Primus pot, this one from Snow Peak is <strong>made of titanium</strong>, so it weighs significantly less, at just <strong>6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>.</li>

But still, you can still find some very good enamel camping items, like <strong>enamel camping cups</strong>. Enamel has the advantage of being quite cheap, which is never a bad thing. It’s also quite easy to clean, and when you’re in the outdoors, where you don’t have a tap full of hot water and a sink, the easier things are to clean, the happier you will be.
<h2>Enamel Camping Cups</h2>
What you want to consider when buying enamel camping cups.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – When it comes to enamel camping cups, you need to decide on exactly how big your cups are. If you like to have a big mug of coffee in the morning, for instance, it’s probably a good idea to go with a larger enamel cup, so that you can fit it all in the first time, rather than having to go back for seconds.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Even with enamel cups, there are some definite differences in the weight of various models. Some <!--more-->enamel cups, for instance, have a stainless steel core that adds quite a bit of strength to the cup, but also adds quite a bit of weight. So decide how important weight is to you, versus other factors, like strength and durability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Enamel Camping Cups</h2>
Some of the very best enamel camping cups to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401162/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-cup-12-oz\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Cup</a> - This isn't a straight enamel cup, but rather a <strong>stainless steel cup coated with enamel</strong>, for a classic look and a bit of extra durability. It does, however, have a stainless steel rim. It will hold a <strong>total of .35 liters</strong>, and <strong>weighs 4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815427/gsi-outdoors-enamelware-cup-12-fl-oz\">GSI Outdoors Enamelware Cup</a> - This is very similar to the enamelware cup above, though this one is green and the one above is blue. But this is also a <strong>stainless steel core covered in baked enamelware</strong>, with a stainless steel rim poking through. It even holds the same amount, that being <strong>.35 liters of liquid</strong>. What is different is that this one appears to have a slightly more durable enamel coating, and also weighs slightly more, at <strong>4.4 ounces, or 124 grams</strong>. It also costs slightly more than the one above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sierra-table-set-blue\">GSI Sierra Table Set</a> - Why get just one cup when you can get a whole set of enamelware camping supplies. This set <strong>comes with 4 of the top cup on this list, as well as 4 plates and bowls</strong>, all of which are the <strong>same stainless steel inner core with an enamelware coating</strong> on the outside. So if you're buying in bulk and need plates and bowls too, this is a great deal on a whole set of enamel camping gear.</li>

And while a low output headlamp will be useful for conserving battery power, <strong>bright headlamps</strong> have their uses too. When you’re moving fast in the outdoors at night, for instance, you want something that will illuminate a wide area, so that there are no surprises waiting in the dark for you.
<h2>Bright Headlamps</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for bright headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – The main thing you want to pay attention to, when shopping for a bright headlamp, is the lumens, which are a measurement of how much light a headlamp produces. The higher the lumens measurement, the more light you can expect your headlamp to give you, and the brighter everything will be.</li>
	<li><strong>Power Settings</strong> – Sometimes you want a bright headlamp that will illuminate the whole forest, and sometimes <!--more-->you just need a headlamp that is going to give you enough light to find something at the bottom of your bag. A headlamp with different power settings is ideal, because it does both jobs as efficiently as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bright Headlamps</h2>
Some of the very best and brightest headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-pro-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Pro Headlamp</a> - With a full <strong>200 lumens</strong> of light at your disposal, this is a very bright headlamp. That brightness comes from a very <strong>powerful 3-watt LED</strong>. It also has a few lower power LEDs that make the <strong>4 different power settings</strong> usable. At the lowest power, it will <strong>last for an impressive 100 hours</strong>. It's also waterproof, and weighs a total of <strong>6.1 ounces, or 172 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - The Ultra can put out an <strong>impressive 350 lumens</strong> on the highest power setting, making it one of the absolute brightest headlamps on the market. It has <strong>two other brightness levels</strong>, but putting out so much power drains the battery quickly, and even on the <strong>lowest power setting you only get 17 hours of use</strong>, while the 350 lumens setting will drain the battery in just 2 hours. However, the Ultra comes with <strong>its own rechargeable battery</strong>, so you at least wont have to buy batteries in bulk. The whole thing weighs <strong>12.2 ounces, or 345 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/x-shot-headlamp\">Mammut X-Shot Headlamp</a> - The X-shot is one more very bright LED headlamp, this one with <strong>200 lumens</strong> at its disposal. It has four different power settings, but what separates the X-Shot from the other two above is that it's the lightest of the headlamps on this list, at just <strong>5.2 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>. So while it's not as bright as the Ultra, for instance, it at least wont feel like you're wearing a weight on your head. It will also<strong> last for an amazing 500 hours on the lowest setting</strong>, which is a low powered red strobe.</li>

Bear deterrent spray is as much for scaring away bears as it is for your own peace of mind. But with that said, not all bear deterrent sprays are made equal, and depending on what your priorities are, you may want to go with a certain bear deterrent spray over another model.
<h2>Bear Deterrent Spray</h2>
What to look at when reviewing bear deterrent spray.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Spray Time</strong> – A larger can of bear deterrent spray will, naturally, spray for a longer period of time. The downside with a larger can is that it is both bulkier and heavier, and will be a bit more difficult to carry. So if you’re especially worried about bears more spray time might be a good idea, but otherwise a smaller can is likely fine.</li>
	<li><strong>Distance</strong> – A larger can of bear deterrent spray will also tend to go a bit farther. The potential<!--more--> distance that your bear spray will go has a lot to do with things like your aim and the environment that you find yourself in, but even so, when there’s a bear charging at you ever single foot does indeed matter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Deterrent Spray</h2>
There aren't many choices, but these are the best bear deterrent sprays.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray (small)</a> - This smaller can of bear deterrent spray contains <strong>230 grams</strong> of spray to work with. That gives you <strong>roughly 7.2 seconds of spray time</strong>, and the spray will go somewhere <strong>between 12 and 30 feet</strong>. It's also slightly lighter than the larger can, at 11 ounces, which is 311 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray (large)</a> - This larger can of bear deterrent spray holds a total of <strong>290 grams</strong> of bear spray. That extra bit of spray means you get <strong>9 seconds of spray</strong>. The larger amount of spray also goes slightly farther, with a range of somewhere <strong>between 12 and 32 feet</strong>. The can weighs 15 ounces, or 425 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray Holster</a> - A bear can be on you in seconds, and if you expect to be able to use your bear deterrent spray in such a situation, it has to be easily accessible. A <strong>holster is the ideal way to make it accessible</strong>. This particular holster will work with either of the two sizes above. If you want, you can get the bear deterrent spray and holster in a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-spray-deterent\">package deal</a>.</li>

But as long as you have the necessary gear you at least wont be wet and miserable. <strong>Rain gaiters</strong> are a great piece of gear to have if you want your feet to stay dry. Rain, and moisture off of bushes and grass, has a habit of finding its way down your legs and in to your boots or shoes. But a good pair of waterproof gaiters can help prevent that, and can help keep other stuff, like rocks and sticks, out of your shoes and boots as well.
<h2>Rain Gaiters</h2>
What you want to look at when buying rain gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – It goes without saying that any good pair of rain gaiters needs to be waterproof. A fabric like Gore Tex is an obvious choice, then, but it’s not the only choice. eVent is another very popular waterproof material that performs comparably to Gore Tex, and also tends to cost a fair bit less, though it can be harder to find.</li>
	<li><strong>Mid-Calf Length</strong> – If you want to keep rain out of your boots or shoes then you will likely want the kind of <!--more-->gaiters that reach up to the mid-calf. Ankle gaiters will do the job too, but that extra bit of exposed leg is just more opportunity for water to get down in to your boots and shoes, and you’re likely better off with a taller pair of gaiters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rain Gaiters</h2>
A few of the very best choices when it comes to rain gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769562/mountain-hardwear-ascent-stretch-air-permeable-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Ascent Stretch Air Permeable Gaiters</a> - These are a solid pair of <strong>more breathable, full length</strong> gaiters from Mountain Hardwear. Both the <strong>upper and lower portions are made with varieties of nylon</strong>, which is a good fabric for both breathing well, keeping water out and drying quickly. They're also priced very well compared to a lot of other comparable gaiters, so a solid pair of rain proof gaiters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiters</a> - If you just want something to keep water out of your boots there's no reason that you need full length gaiters. <strong>Ankle gaiters</strong>, like these, will do that job just as well. They're <strong>made with eVent, which is a fabric similar to Gore Tex, but more breathable</strong>, which is a definite plus when it comes to gaiters. The bottom portion is also a lighter 500D cordura nylon, which is tough stuff, but definitely lighter than the 1000D cordura used on some of the heavier duty gaiters. A <strong>fantastic pair ankle rain gaiters</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">Women's</a>) - These are <strong>full on mountaineering gaiters</strong> that will keep out rain, snow and just about anything else you throw at them. They're a <strong>full length gaiter, and actually won the Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award way back in 1999</strong>, which gives you some idea of how long these gaiters have been around. The top is <strong>3 layer Gore Tex</strong>, while the bottom is 1000D cordura nylon, which will take as much use and abuse as you can throw at it. These are a very solid gaiter that will perform well in the rain and just about any other weather condition.</li>

Part of it is that down has one of the best warmth to weight ratios of any insulating material out there. But down is also great because it packs down extremely small. Still, there are some big differences between how well certain down will pack down, and the most <strong>packable down jacket</strong> will have a few certain things going for it.
<h2>Packable Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a packable down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – First and foremost, you need to be paying attention to the quality of the down if you want a packable down jacket. 900+ fill down lofts better than 700+ fill down, meaning that you need less of the 900+ fill down to provide the same amount of warmth. And less down means a more packable down jacket.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood on a down jacket is a useful feature, especially when the temperature drops<!--more--> and you start getting cold. But if you’re worried first and foremost about how packable your down jacket is, then eliminating excess features, like a hood, will help you cut down on the size of your down jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Packable Down Jacket</h2>
Some of the most packable down jackets for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - This is a good compromise of features and lightweight design. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, which isn't the highest quality available, but it's a <strong>relatively thin jacket</strong>, so there isn't a whole lot of insulation, which helps to make it packable. It also has a few features, like a hood and a few zippered pockets, that add to the bulk, but will also go a long ways towards keeping you warm. So it <strong>walks the line between functionality and packability well</strong>. It weighs <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Ex Light is what you want if something truly lightweight and packable is what you desire. The Ex Light uses the <strong>very high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which is about the best you will get when it comes to down quality. And while it's a thinner down jacket, like the Patagonia jacket above, this one has <strong>no hood and even no hand pockets</strong>, so it really has been designed with weight and packability front and center. The whole jacket weighs a very impressive <strong>5.7 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bitterroot-850-down-jacket-men-s\">GoLite Bitterroot Down Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bitterroot-850-down-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - The Bitterroot is an ideal choice if you want something a little warmer. It's <strong>packed with 850+ fill down, and plenty of it</strong>, which will keep you warmer than either of the two jackets above. But of course, the high quality down makes it as packable as possible, relative to warmth. It also has a <strong>hood and a couple of zippered hand warming pockets</strong> to keep those extremities warm too. It weighs a little more, at <strong>13 ounces or 370 grams</strong>, but with all the extra down packed in to keep you warm in colder weather, that's to be expected.</li>

But tents can also get expensive, especially when you want a good one, and so looking for a <strong>cheap tent</strong> is a good idea if you want to have some money left over for other outdoor gear, like sleeping bags and backpacks. A sale is always a good place to start when looking for a cheap tent, but if you know what to look for you can find some high quality, yet cheap tents.
<h2>Cheap Tent</h2>
What you want to see when reviewing cheap tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Sad to say, if you’re looking for a lightweight tent, you’re not likely to find many cheap options. Better, lighter materials and improved construction techniques means that lightweight tents tend to be more expensive, even if they do use a bit less material. There are, of course, a few exceptions, if you know where to look.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Bigger tents that are made to fit more people tend to be more expensive, so if you’re looking <!--more-->for a cheap tent, consider getting a 1 or 2 man tent, and let other people worry about their own shelter. The main reason for buying larger tents is to save on weight, but tents start getting heavy very fast at about the 4 man point anyway, so smaller is sometimes better in that way too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Tent</h2>
Some of the very best cheap tents to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731378/rei-camp-dome-2-tent\">REI Camp Dome 2 Tent</a> - If all you want is a <strong>good, basic cheap tent</strong> that you can do a little camping with, then the Camp Dome from REI is an ideal choice. This particular one has <strong>room for 2</strong>, but there is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">4 man version</a>. It's a <strong>basic rectangular design with two poles, though it has two doors</strong> which can certainly come in handy. No vestibule on either door, unfortunately, and at <strong>4 pounds 15 ounces, or 2.24 kilograms</strong> it's not the lightest tent in the world, but the low price really is the best feature of this tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eureka-alpenlite-2xt-tent-2-person-4-season\">Eureka Alpenlite 2XT Tent</a> - 4 season tents are not generally cheap, but this is definitely one of the cheaper options out there. It has <strong>room for 2</strong>, and comes with <strong>plenty of ventilation options</strong> to ensure that you wont wake up with condensation coating the walls. It features an <strong>impressive 6 poles</strong>, which adds an impressive amount of strength, plus a low profile that will prevent it from catching too much wind. At <strong>8.85 pounds, or 4.01 kilograms</strong> it's not all that lightweight, but then 4 season tents rarely are.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - If you're looking to go <strong>lightweight backpacking</strong> but don't want to have to shell out a whole lot for a fancy, lightweight tent then the Contrail is an ideal choice. At <strong>24.5 ounces, or 700 grams</strong> it's light enough and small enough that you'll hardly know you're carrying it. Innovative features like a <strong>single wall design and the option to use trekking poles as tent poles</strong> are what help make this a lightweight option. It only has <strong>room inside for 1</strong>, but the weight savings are well worth it, and the smaller capacity helps to keep the price down. So an ideal cheap tent for those that want to save weight.</li>

You can compare them by their brightness, for instance, if brightness is important to you. Another important metric when it comes to a good <strong>headlamp comparison</strong> is the battery life. Some headlamps will last for just a few hours, while others will last for hundreds. A lot of that has to do with power settings, but some of it comes down to just having a better battery that can put out more juice.
<h2>Headlamp Comparison</h2>
Find out what you need to know to make a good headlamp comparison.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – The primary job of a headlamp is to illuminate whatever you point it at, so one of the most useful metrics for comparing headlamps is the amount of lumens which they can produce. The higher the lumens, the more light you will get. Related to that, you likely want a headlamp with multiple power settings, so that you can get less lumens when you want to conserve power.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Another metric that many people may find useful is weight. Backpackers, for instance, may<!--more--> want a lightweight headlamp that will add a minimal amount of weight to their backpack. More generally, weight can be a good indicator of how big a headlamp is, and how powerful it will be.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Headlamp Comparison Reviews</h2>
A comparison of a few of the best headlamps, in various categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-zipka-plus-2-headlamp-ptz0263\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2</a> - If all you want is something <strong>lightweight, and you're not too concerned about brightness</strong>, the Zipka 2 makes an excellent choice. It's <strong>very small, and even has a retractable strap</strong> so that it fits right in your pocket when you're not using it. It's also capable of a fairly impressive <strong>70 lumens on the highest power setting, and 155 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>, which is rather impressive for such a small package. It weighs <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong> with batteries.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm</a> - If you want a headlamp that does everything well, the Storm is the headlamp for you. It provides a fantastic <strong>100 lumens of light</strong>, which is more than enough for most people, and will go for a total of <strong>200 hours when on the lowest power setting</strong>. And as the name suggests, it's also <strong>waterproof</strong>, so a good choice for when things get wet and you still need to be able to see. It weighs <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong> with batteries.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra</a> - If all you care about is brightness, then you need a headlamp with high lumens, and the Ultra has plenty of that. With a <strong>maximum output of 350 lumens</strong> there are few headlamps that will do as good a job of turning in to day. But that ample amount of light doesn't come without a price, which in this case is battery life. Even on the <strong>lowest setting the Ultra will only go for 17 hours</strong>. Fortunately for you the Ultra has a <strong>rechargeable battery</strong>, so you wont have to be buying AAAs in bulk. It <strong>weighs 12.1 ounces, or 346 grams</strong>.</li>

But if coffee is a necessity, there are some surprisingly good <strong>backpacking coffee maker</strong> options for those looking to start their mornings with a good cup of coffee. Some are so lightweight that the coffee grounds will end up being the heavy part.
<h2>Backpacking Coffee Maker</h2>
What to look for in a backpacking coffee maker.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Method</strong> – Do you prefer your coffee dripped, or perhaps a French press is more to your liking? Whatever method of making coffee you prefer, there is a backpacking coffee maker that can accommodate you. Some are lighter and smaller than others, of course, but you do have options.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Some outdoor coffee makers are heavy, bulky and not suited to taking backpacking with you. A good<!--more--> backpacking coffee maker is, more than anything, a coffee maker that will take up a minimal amount of room in your backpack and wont weigh a lot, so that you don’t regret taking it after a long day of walking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Coffee Maker</h2>
Some of the very best backpacking coffee makers to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - If you prefer your coffee made from a press then the Titanium Cafe Press from Snow Peak is about as good as you're going to get. The pot has <strong>enough room for about 2 cups of coffee, and doubles as a cooking pot too</strong>, for at night when you need to make dinner. And being titanium, the whole thing weighs a scant <strong>6.3 ounces, which is 178 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee Filter</a> - The MSR MugMate was the <strong>2009 winner of the Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>, and for good reason. It's the same basic design that a tea immersion filter uses, but with a better screen for keeping coffee grounds out of your coffee. Of course you can <strong>reuse the filter innumerable amount of times</strong>, and you can make your coffee as strong or as weak as you prefer, just by leaving the filter in for a certain amount of time. And when you're not using it, it fits snugly inside your cup or mug for easy travel. The whole thing also weighs just <strong>1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-java-drip\">GSI Ultralight Java Drip</a> - If you prefer a <strong>drip filter</strong> for making your coffee the Java Drip by GSI is an innovative solution. A couple of <strong>plastic legs suspend the drip filter above your cup</strong>, so that you can quickly make a cup of coffee. Best of all, the whole thing <strong>folds down flat and weighs just .5 ounces, or about 14 grams</strong>, which is close as you'll get to nothing.</li>

If there’s snow on the ground, it will only take a few steps before you’ve got snow going down your boots if you neglected to bring a good pair of gaiters. And for scree slopes, gaiters can be essential for keeping all kinds of material from finding its way in to your boots.
<h2>Mountaineering Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for mountaineering gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Depending on what the conditions are, you may be just fine with ankle gaiters. If you’re trying to avoid material getting in to your shoes or boots when navigating scree slopes, for instance, then ankle gaiters are likely all you need. But for deep snow, the mid-calf length gaiters are a better choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Again, this comes down to what you intend to use your mountaineering gaiters for. Scree <!--more-->slopes certainly don’t require that your gaiters be waterproof, but snow has a habit of sticking to gaiters, where your body heat will melt in, and so snow likely necessitates waterproof gaiters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mountaineering Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best choices for mountaineering gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Crocodile gaiters have been around since at least <strong>1999, when they won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and it's easy to see why. They're made with a <strong>3 layer Gore Tex upper</strong>, which is tough enough to withstand abuse and also keep out water and snow, while the <strong>bottom section is 1000D cordura nylon</strong>, which will be more than tough enough to shrug off boot rubbing, scree fields and anything else.  The top uses a buckle and strap to secure to your leg.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827256/the-north-face-gore-tex-gaiters\">The North Face Gore-Tex Gaiters</a> - These are a pair of gaiters quite similar to the Crocodile gaiters above, but without their impressive history. They're a <strong>Gore Tex upper</strong>, so that the snow and rain stays outside, and doesn't get in. The <strong>lower section is 1000D cordura nylon</strong>, which is more than tough enough for scree fields and the like. The top is even a similar buckle and strap system. So another excellent Gore Tex mountaineering gaiter choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Extreme Gaiters</a> - When it comes to mountaineering gaiters Gore Tex is the obvious choice, but not the only choice. The Latok gaiters from Rab are <strong>made with eVent, a fabric similar to Gore Tex, though more breathable</strong>. They're made to work well with larger mountaineering boots, and use <strong>500D nylon for the bottom section</strong>, which is tough enough to stand up to plenty of abuse. The top is a drawcord enclosure, and they come in three different sizes.</li>

One of them if eVent. An <strong>eVent rain jacket</strong> does an excellent job of keeping you dry. And whereas something like Gore Tex breathes better when you’re exerting yourself eVent is breathable even when you’re not that active. It also helps that it’s generally less expensive than Gore Tex.
<h2>eVent Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when reviewing eVent rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Any good rain jacket needs to have some sort of ventilation. eVent is a great fabric because it’s quite breathable just one its own. But something like pit zips, which are zippered openings under each armpit, do an excellent job of keeping you well ventilated, especially when you’re exerting yourself.</li>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – The material that your jacket is made out of is important for staying dry, but things like seams and zippers are channels through <!--more-->even the most waterproof material, and if they’re not properly sealed they will leak. So pay attention to just how waterproof seams and zippers are if you want to stay dry.</li>
</ul>

Find a few of the very best eVent rain jackets for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's eVent Rain Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/826021/rei-kimtah-rain-jacket-mens\">REI Kimtah Rain Jacket</a> - The Kimtah is a good jacket for around town and out on the trail too. It uses <strong>3 layer eVent</strong>, and has a fairly standard design with a couple of zippered pockets for your hands, a <strong>good hood and fully taped seams for complete waterproofing</strong>. Surprisingly it doesn't have pit zips, which is a fairly standard feature on rain jackets. eVent is definitely more breathable than something like Gore Tex, however, and you will likely not miss the pit zips.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-momentum-jacket-mens\">Rab Momentum Jacket</a> - If you're looking for something a little more technical for more aggressive outdoor pursuits, the Momentum makes an <strong>excellent technical hard shell. It uses 3 layer eVent</strong>, and has two zippered chest pockets, rather than hand pockets. There's no pit zips on this jacket, just like the Kimtah above, and that is due to eVent's impressive breathability. The <strong>hood is also better suited to technical adventures</strong>, with an adjustable wire built in, and a good drawcord for when things get windy.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's eVent Rain Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/826024/rei-kimtah-rain-jacket-womens\">REI Kimtah Rain Jacket</a> - The Kimtah is a great jacket for the trail and around town too. It's made with <strong>3 layer eVent</strong>, and has all the standard rain jacket features like <strong>zippered hand pockets, a hood and fully taped seams so that nothing leaks</strong>. The one thing it doesn't have is underarm zippers, to give you some extra ventilation. The reason being, eVent is breathable enough that you don't really need them. So a great jacket for a wide variety of uses.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-event-stash-shell-womens\">Stoic eVent Stash Shell</a> - The Stash Shell is a <strong>technical hard shell ideal for more serious outdoor pursuits. It uses 3 layer eVent</strong>, and has one zippered chest pocket for a few essentials, plus two zippered hand pockets for keeping those digits warm. Like the Kimtah above, the only thing really missing is underarm zippers, for added ventilation. eVent being a very breathable fabric, however, you're not likely to need them, even on a technical hard shell.</li>

It’s not perfect for any one thing, but it’s pretty good for a lot of different things. So a <strong>weatherproof soft shell jacket</strong> is a lot to ask, but there are definitely a few of the best soft shell jackets that are up to the task. If you’re wanting a truly weatherproof soft shell jacket, however, you are likely going to have to spend the good money for a quality jacket with all of the better features.
<h2>Weatherproof Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a weatherproof soft shell jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – The first and most important feature to get if you expect your soft shell jacket to be weatherproof is a water resistant exterior. Rain and snow are two of the more uncomfortable weather conditions to be caught out in, after all, and you will definitely want something that can stand up to that as best as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulated</strong> – Cold temperatures are another weather condition that you may want your soft shell jacket to be able to <!--more-->brave, and in that case you will likely want an insulated soft shell jacket. An insulated soft shell jacket will also provide better protection from the wind, which is yet another ugly weather condition that you will likely want to be protected from.</li>

<h3><strong>Men's Weatherproof Soft Shell Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816399/marmot-zion-jacket-mens\">Marmot Zion Jacket</a> - The Zion is actually called a <strong>waterproof</strong> jacket, though it might not be a good idea to take it out in too many rain storms. But still, a waterproof soft shell is certainly a weatherproof soft shell jacket. The outer shell is also <strong>extremely windproof</strong>, but does breath well, which is what you would expect from a soft shell jacket. It has a <strong>hood, of course, and a few nice details, like taped seams</strong>, for better waterproofing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hooded Jacket</a> - The Hyllus is the jacket you want when the temperature drops way down low. It <strong>uses heavy 300 weight fleece</strong> to keep you toasty warm, but also a solid soft shell exterior, which makes it <strong>water and wind resistant</strong>. The hood will help keep you warm and comfortable, of course, but this really is an ideal soft shell jacket for those cold, ugly days in the outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Weatherproof Soft Shell Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-zion-jacket-womens\">Marmot Zion Jacket</a> - The Zion is touted as being a <strong>waterproof soft shell jacket</strong>, though you might want to think twice before taking it out in too many rain storms. But still, it's likely more waterproof than just about any other soft shell jacket you'll find, which certainly makes it weatherproof. The fact that it <strong>blocks out just about all wind</strong> helps, of course, and a <strong>hood as well as a couple of zippered hand pockets</strong> will help keep your extremities out of the weather too. So as far as water goes, you cant do better than the Zion.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/756509/arcteryx-hyllus-hoodie-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hooded Jacket</a> - The Hyllus is <strong>water and wind resistant</strong>, but where it will really stand out is those cold days where you need something to keep you warm and insulated. It uses the <strong>heavy 300 weight</strong>, plus a nice thick <strong>hood and a couple of zippered hand pockets</strong> to keep every inch of you warm. It also helps that it <strong>won the 2008 Gear of the Year award from Outside magazine</strong>. So a very solid soft shell jacket for those cold, dreary days.</li>

Alternatives like bivy sacks and hammocks do exist, but there is a reason that the tent is by far the most popular kind of shelter out there. But hiking tents come in a wide range of shapes and sizes, and getting the right hiking tent for you starts with you identifying what it is that you need your hiking tent to do for you.
<h2>Hiking Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing hiking tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re going to be carrying your tent, then it pays to get a small, lightweight tent, instead of a bulky, heavy tent. You will have room in your backpack for more important stuff, and your knees and back will feel a lot better at the end of the day then they otherwise would have with a heavier tent.</li>
	<li><strong>Seasons</strong> – If you know what you’re doing you can make a 3 season tent work in most winter conditions, but it’s a lot easier, and safer, to take a proper 4 season tent when you go winter<!--more--> camping. They tend to stand up a lot better to wind, snow and the other conditions that you run in to in the winter.</li>
</ul>

The UL 2 weighs in at <strong>2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong>, and while it's not terribly big inside, with 28 square feet of space for two people, it's enough. A fantastic hiking tent for anyone concerned about weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-eldorado-tent-2-person-4-season\">Black Diamond Eldorado</a> - If you plan to be doing any serious <strong>four season hiking</strong> then a four season tent like the Eldorado might ideally suite your purposes. It's a <strong>2 man, single wall design</strong>, though it has enough ventilation to keep you from collecting too much condensation inside. It has just two poles, but it's a strong enough tent for rough weather. It also has <strong>30.8 square feet of space</strong>, which is a good amount for two people and winter camping gear. The whole thing <strong>weighs 4 pounds 8 ounces, or 2.04 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-competition-tent-1-per-3-season\">Terra Nova Laser Competition</a> - The Laser Competition is one more fantastic hiking tent, this time from UK manufacturer Terra Nova.

	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – GPS units don’t last nearly as long as something like a watch when it comes to battery life.

If you’re the kind of person that finds it difficult to get a good night of sleep as it is, this is especially true. Camping can be a lot of fun, after all, but it can also be rather physically taxing, and for your body to recover after a long day outside, you need a good sleep. So while you might be tempted to get with what’s cheap, <strong>sleeping mats for camping</strong> should really be judged on their level of comfort.
<h2>Sleeping Mats for Camping</h2>
What to look for when you want sleeping mats for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – There are a few different choices that you have when it comes to the shape of your sleeping mat for camping. A rectangular mat is great, for instance, if you’re the kind of person that move around a lot at night, but then a rectangular mat also weighs more than a mummy shaped mat.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – R-value, briefly, is a measurement of how much heat a sleeping pad will reflect back at you. In summer, when <!--more-->nights are fairly warm it doesn’t matter a whole lot, but in winter this can be an important variable that helps to determine how comfortable and warm you are at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Mats for Camping</h2>
Some of the very best sleeping mats for camping with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - Without a doubt, the <strong>most popular sleeping mat</strong> for camping on the market, and with good reason. It <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, but what really makes it popular is the combination of <strong>inflatable pad, rectangular shape and very low weight of 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>. With an <strong>R-value of 2.5</strong> it's not suited for anything more than three season, but definitely one of the best possible choices.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - Another <strong>rectangular, inflatable sleeping mat</strong>, though this one comes with a layer of down built in, to bump the <strong>R-value up to an impressive 8</strong>, making it an ideal sleeping mat for camping in winter conditions. It's also surprisingly lightweight for a winter sleeping mat, with a weight of <strong>34.6 ounces, or 980 grams</strong>. The price is definitely a little high, but if you want to stay warm without adding a lot of weight to your backpack, you wont find a better sleeping mat then this one.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810386/therm-a-rest-ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest RidgeRest SOlite</a> - Inflatable sleeping pads certainly aren't the only option. This <strong>rectangular foam sleeping mat</strong> has ridges to increase comfort without adding too much weight, and an aluminized surface to help reflect as much body heat as possible back at you. An <strong>R-value of 2.8 makes</strong> it suitable for three season camping, and a weight of just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong> makes it a relatively lightweight option as well. It also comes in a large and small size.</li>

It comes in handy in a survival situation, for sure, but it’s also handy for other, more mundane tasks. Making dinner, for instance, is often a lot easier to do when you have a good camping knife at your disposal. Similarly, you can quickly amass kindling for a fire when you have a camping knife. There are even some crude gear repair jobs that can be made easier with a camping knife.
<h2>Good Camping Knife</h2>
What to look for when you want a good camping knife.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re going to be carrying your camping knife then you likely don’t want a big, heavy camping knife, you’ll be much better off with a lightweight camping knife. A knife is a chunk of metal, remember, and a big camping knife is going to be quite a bit heavier than a smaller, lighter knife.</li>
	<li><strong>Serrated</strong> – To maximize the versatility of your camping knife it helps if a portion of the blade is serrated. That way, you have the option of sawing through things like rope with <!--more-->the serrated section of the knife, but you also have a smooth blade, which can be a lot more useful for things like preparing meals.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good Camping Knife Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some good camping knives, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/34-gram-pocket-knife-black-titanium\">Baladeo 34 Gram Pocket Knife</a> - First up, a<strong> tiny little knife</strong> that is a great piece of equipment to have around just in case you find you need something sharp. It weighs just <strong>1.2 ounces, or 34 grams</strong> the name suggests, but manages a <strong>3.6 inch blade</strong>, which is definitely a respectable length for so little weight. It's also a <strong>folding knife, and has a small serrated section</strong> on the blade. So a fantastic option if you want a lightweight camping knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816234/gerber-bear-grylls-ultimate-knife\">Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Knife</a> - At the other end of the spectrum from the Baladeo is something like the Ultimate from Gerber. It's a <strong>big, tough fixed blade knife with a 4.8 inch blade and a serrated section</strong> on the bottom. It also includes a <strong>sheath with a built in sharpener, plus a small flint</strong> which you can use in conjunction with the knife to create sparks and start a fire. So it's a knife with a few built in survival options that make it that much more useful for campers. The whole thing <strong>weighs 14.7 ounces, or 416 grams</strong>, which is quite a difference from the Baladeo above. If you want just the knife and not the survival stuff, Gerber makes a very similar knife called the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Big Rock</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-paraframe-i-serrated-edge-knife\">Gerber Paraframe I Serrated Edge Knife</a> - Finally, an all-around good camping knife. It's a <strong>folding knife, with a 3 inch blade</strong>. It's definitely strong, though not especially heavy at <strong>2.6 ounces, or 73 grams</strong>. A portion of the blade is serrated, so that you have cutting options, and has a small clip on the frame so that you can put it on your belt for easy access. An all around good camping knife.</li>

And if a few other people in your group feel the same way, then something like a <strong>stainless steel camping coffee pot</strong> might be a useful thing to have. Why just make coffee for yourself, after all, when you can use a coffee pot to make enough for the whole group instead. Just make sure that you get someone else to carry all that coffee, so that you don’t get stuck with all the weight.
<h2>Stainless Steel Camping Coffee Pot</h2>
What to look at when reviewing a stainless steel camping coffee pot.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> – A coffee pot by itself is not a terribly useful piece of equipment. It helps, for instance, if your coffee pot works with a French press, for instance, so that your pot works as part of the coffee making process. Even better, get a coffee pot that doubles as a cooking pot, so that you have one device that does two jobs.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Stainless steel is strong, but it’s also heavy. A material like titanium is strong and also lightweight, but a fair <!--more-->bit more expensive. So pay attention to how big your stainless steel camping coffee pot is, and how much it weighs, so that you don’t end up carrying around too much weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Stainless Steel Camping Coffee Pot</h2>
Some of the best options when it comes to stainless steel camping coffee pots.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-trekker-small\">Kelly Kettle Stainless Steel Trekker</a> - If you're the kind of person that cant make do with just a morning cup of coffee, then something like this kettle might be ideal. It's a <strong>combination of stove and pot that uses just about any fuel source</strong>. So when you stop for lunch, for instance, you can <strong>boil water in 3 to 5 minutes</strong> with whatever sticks you find on the ground. Of course it works equally well for boiling water for dinner. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 11.2 ounces, or 771 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/765758/rei-campware-percolator-12-cup\">REI Campware Percolator</a> - This Percolator from REI is a great way to make coffee in the outdoors. It will make <strong>1.77 liters, which is about enough coffee for 12 cups</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>, and it also comes in a slightly <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/765759/rei-campware-percolator-9-cup\">smaller and lighter size</a> that will make about 9 cups of coffee, so ideal for smaller groups.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-glacier-stainless-coffee-percolator\">GSI Outdoors Glacier Stainless Coffee Percolator</a> - Another coffee percolator option for campers, this time from GSI. This particular percolator comes in <strong>two different sizes, one of which will make about 8 cups of coffee and the other will make about 14 cups</strong>, so a few different size options when compared the REI percolator above. The 14 cup version also weighs just <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 878 grams</strong>, which is lighter than the smaller, 12 cup version from REI above.</li>

Synthetic insulation does have a few advantages, but most people looking for a serious sleeping bag end up going with a <strong>goose down sleeping bag</strong>. Goose down compresses a lot better than synthetic insulation, so it fits better in a backpack. Goose down also weighs less, relative to warmth, so your backpack ends up being lighter too, which is another good thing.
<h2>Goose Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for from a goose down sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Once you’ve decided on a goose down sleeping bag, you still need to decide on what quality of down to get. Down with a high fill number will provide more warmth for the same amount of weight, but also tends to cost more. So if you’re looking for the best, you want a sleeping bag with a high fill number, likely 800 fill or above.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Another important choice to make is the shape of the sleeping bag. If you’re going to be carrying your <!--more-->sleeping bag for any length of time you’re likely going to want a mummy shaped sleeping bag. You wont have as much room to move around at night, but you save on both weight and bulk, which makes for a more enjoyable day with your backpack on.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Goose Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the very best goose down sleeping bags, at a few different minimum temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795982/mountain-hardwear-phantom-15-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - First up, a fantastic mummy cut down sleeping bag from Mountain Hardwear. It has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, making it ideal for four season camping or backpacking. The exterior of the sleeping bag is treated with a <strong>durable water repellent finish to keep the 800+ fill down</strong> inside dry, which in turn keeps you warm. The zipper is a full length, 2 way design that gives you a few ventilation options, and at <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 870 grams</strong> you'll hardly even notice that you're carrying this sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-spiral-down-hugger-3-sleeping-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #3</a> - The Hugger #3 is a solid three season sleeping bag. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, plus a <strong>water resistant exterior treatment</strong> to keep you and the down dry. This sleeping bag is also an award winner, having snagged the <strong>2009 Gear of the Year award from Outside magazine</strong>. And it weighs just <strong>1 pound 3 ounces, or 538 grams</strong>, making it a very lightweight choice. So another very solid sleeping bag, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 30 degrees</strong>, which makes it ideal for three season use.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - With a very cool <strong>minimum temperature of 35 degrees</strong>, the HighLite is more of a summer sleeping bag, though it might be good for spring and fall use in the warmer parts of the world. What really helps this sleeping bag stand out, however, is a weight of just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>. Part of the reason for such a low weight is the high quality <strong>850 fill down</strong>. So an excellent, lightweight summer down sleeping bag from Mont Bell.</li>

But if you’re backpacking all day to reach that campsite, it’s a smart idea to look at <strong>ultralight tents</strong>. With a smaller, lighter tent your legs and back will feel far better than they otherwise would at the end of the day. You might have to spend a bit more for an ultralight tent, but most people find that the investment is more than worth it.
<h2>Ultralight Tents</h2>
What to look for when you want an ultralight tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Single Wall</strong> – One of the more obvious features to look for when buying an ultralight tent is a single wall design. Provided that you have enough ventilation there’s no reason to not just have one waterproof tent wall, and when you cut the amount of fabric you’re using in half, you save quite a bit of weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Accessories</strong> – The tent itself has a weight, but so does all of the other stuff that goes with it. Getting a tent that<!--more--> will allow you to use trekking poles as the supports, for instance, eliminates the need to take along separate tent poles. And you would be surprised at how much weight difference there can be between two different tent pegs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Tents</h2>
Some of the very best ultralight tents for you take in to the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2</a> - If you want an <strong>ultralight, free standing tent</strong> then there aren't too many choices better than the Fly Creek. It <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and part of the reason for that was the very impressive weight of <strong>2 pounds 2 ounces, or 963 grams</strong>. It comes with 28 square feet of floor space, which isn't a ton, but enough for two people, and there is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">1 man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">3 man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">4 man</a> version available, if a 2 man tent isn't what you're looking for. So an excellent ultralight dome tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-twin-sisters-tent-2-person-4-season\">MSR Twin Sisters</a> - If you need something for 4 season camping or backpacking but don't want to have to carry a big, heavy 4 season tent, then a <strong>4 season tarp</strong> might be a better option. This tarp <strong>works with trekking poles</strong>, or the included lightweight tent poles, so you can set two trekking poles up inside, which act as the support structure for the tarp. Being intended for four season use it has <strong>2 doors plus plenty of roof ventilation</strong>, is a single wall design of course, and flaps around the base that will keep out wind and snow. At <strong>3 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.47 kilograms</strong> it's not an ultralight tarp, but it is a very ultralight 4 season option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is another ultralight shelter intended to <strong>work with trekking poles</strong>, if you carry them. It's not a tarp, however, because you are fully enclosed inside, should you want to be. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, which definitely helps to save on weight, and at <strong>24.5 ounces, or 700 grams</strong> it's a fantastically ultralight tent option. It has <strong>21 square feet of interior floor space, which makes it roomy for just one person</strong>, and is also made right in the USA. It helps that it's also by far the cheapest option on this list.</li>

But there also a few choices to make, the most important being whether you want a warm sleeping bag liner or sleeping bag liner that will keep your sleeping bag clean, but add only a minimal amount of weight and warmth. The two options represent two very different sleeping bag liners.
<h2>Lightweight Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
What to look for when you want a lightweight sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – If you want a sleeping bag liner that is both lightweight and warm, then your best option is thermolite. But if you want a lightweight sleeping bag liner that will just keep the inside of your sleeping bag clean first and foremost, silk is the lightest option for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – If you want a lightweight sleeping bag liner then you want a mummy shaped liner. If you already have a mummy shaped sleeping bag then this is an obvious choice, but a<!--more--> mummy shaped sleeping bag liner will fit just fine in a rectangular sleeping bag, and will be lighter than a rectangular sleeping bag liner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Some of the very best lightweight sleeping bag liners to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-100-premium-silk-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Premium Silk Liner</a> - If you want a lightweight sleeping bag liner then silk is your best option. At just <strong>4.4 ounces, or 124 grams</strong> for the mummy version you will be hard pressed to find a lighter sleeping bag liner anywhere. It does also come in a rectangular shape, as well as an extra long version, and you can expect to <strong>add roughly 10 degrees of warmth</strong> to your sleeping bag when using it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/cocoon-silk-egyptian-cotton-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Silk/Egyptian Cotton Liner</a> - A <strong>cotton and silk blend</strong> makes for a fantastic surface to sleep against. You get the familiar comfort of cotton and the weight savings of silk, all in one package. At <strong>6.3 ounces, or 180 grams</strong> it's an extremely lightweight sleeping bag liner option. It will <strong>add approximately 8 degrees of warmth</strong> to your sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/705534/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-mummy-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Liner</a> - If you want a lightweight sleeping bag liner that will add a significant amount of warmth to your sleeping bag then thermolite fabric is the way to go. This particular mummy liner will <strong>add about 15 degrees of warmth</strong>, which is enough to turn a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag, but <strong>only weighs 8.1 ounces, which is 230 grams</strong>. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797114/sea-to-summit-thermolite-reactor-extreme-mummy-bag-liner\">Reactor Extreme</a> that adds a very impressive 25 degrees of warmth.</li>

It allows you to illuminate whatever is in front of you without needing to use your hands, which frees up your hands to do other things. Lighting a stove or finding something in the bottom of your bag, for instance, is easier with a camping headlamp.
<h2>Camping Headlamp</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a camping headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Power Options</strong> – The best camping headlamp is one with multiple power settings. So that when you’re hiking in to the night to try to reach your next campsite you can crank up the power, and you can lower it to conserve batteries when all you’re trying to do is find something at the bottom of your bag before going to bed.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re car camping it doesn’t matter much, but for those that have to carry their camping gear on their back, weight matters. A lightweight camping headlamp will<!--more-->, of course, add less weight to your backpack, and will help you roll in to camp with a back and knees that are thankful for the reduced weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Headlamp</h2>
Some of the very best camping headlamps for your next outdoor trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-zipka-2-headlamp\">Petzl Zipka 2</a> - The Zipka 2 is an ideal headlamp if you just want <strong>something lightweight and small</strong> for those occasional times when you need a bit of light. At <strong>2.4 ounces, or 68 grams</strong> it's definitely one of the lightest headlamps out there. It does, however, manage to put out <strong>70 lumens</strong>, which is impressive for such a small headlamp, and will go for a <strong>maximum of 120 hours</strong>. It also has a <strong>retractable head strap</strong>, so that it fits right in your pocket when you're not using it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm</a> - The Storm is, like the name suggests, the headlamp that you want when things get ugly. It's <strong>waterproof, and will pump out 100 lumens on the high power setting, while lasting for a total of 200 hours on the low power setting</strong>. It's a little heavier, at <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong>, but it's a solid, do-it-all headlamp ideal for a wide range of conditions and uses.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra</a> - The Ultra is built with just one thing in mind, and that is brightness. With a total of <strong>350 lumens</strong> at your disposal you will be able to turn night in to day. Unfortunately, 350 lumens will drain the batteries in just 2 hours. The <strong>lower power setting will last longer, at 17 hours</strong>, but this really is a headlamp built for brightness, and not longevity. Fortunately the <strong>battery is rechargeable</strong>, so you don't have to worry about spending a fortune on AAA batteries. It <strong>weighs 12.2 ounces, or 345 grams</strong>.</li>

It makes a great cup of coffee, for starters, and can work well with existing camping equipment. Especially for backpackers looking to save on weight and not add too much bulk to their backpack, a <strong>backpacking coffee press</strong> is not the only option, but it’s certainly a good option that wont weigh too much or take up too much room, if you do it right.
<h2>Backpacking Coffee Press</h2>
What to look for when you want a backpacking coffee press.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – First and foremost you need to decide on what material you want your backpacking coffee press to be made from. Titanium is a great choice, of course, because it’s lightweight and strong, but it also costs quite a bit. Aluminum is lightweight but weak, and stainless steel is strong but heavy. Both, however, are cheaper than titanium.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> – A coffee press, of course, needs a coffee pot of some sort to work with. Fortunately there are<!--more--> some excellent coffee presses that integrate with pots, so that you can have one pot that works well as a coffee pot and also as a cooking pot, so that you only need one pot to do both jobs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Coffee Press</h2>
Some of the very best backpacking coffee presses to take in to the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - The Titanium Cafe Press from Snow Peak is the undeniable best option for a backpacking cofffee press. It's <strong>titanium, so it weighs in at just 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>. The pot can also <strong>double as a rather tall and narrow cooking pot</strong>, which is actually an ideal shape for cooking long, thin noodles. It also makes <strong>enough coffee for 2 cups</strong>, so you can either indulge yourself or make enough for a friend.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/760629/jetboil-coffee-press\">Jetboil Coffee Press</a> - This is just a coffee press, and not a pot. It's <strong>meant to work in conjunction with a Jetboil cooking pot</strong>, though it would likely work with other pots as well. It's made of <strong>aluminum, and it weighs just 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>, though it's not really a fair comparison to the other presses on this list, because again it's just a press and no pot.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/litech-coffee-tea-press-kit\">Primus LiTech Coffee / Tea Press Kit</a> - This is another combination of press and pot. It's <strong>made of aluminum</strong>, and weighs a total of <strong>9.8 ounces, or 277 grams</strong>. It has a total <strong>capacity of 1 liter</strong>, which is enough for a few cups of coffee. Like the Snow Peak option above you can use the pot for cooking, and not just making coffee, making it a very versatile option. So another good backpacking coffee press option.</li>

What some people might not realize is that bear pepper spray is not the same as pepper spray intended for another human. Not so much in the composition, but more because bear pepper spray is meant to target a bear that is quite some distance away from you, and needs to be more powerful, as a result.
<h2>Bear Pepper Spray</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for bear pepper spray.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Distance</strong> – When a bear is charging you down and you are trying to target it with bear pepper spray, every single foot of distance that you can get out of your can of bear pepper spray matters. How far that spray goes will have a lot to do with you, and the environment you find yourself in, but some cans are more powerful than others.</li>
	<li><strong>Time</strong> – Depending on how large your can of bear pepper spray is, you will get longer or shorter amount of spray time. If a bear is charging you wont be able to <!--more-->get off more than a few seconds of spray, but even so, that extra time can definitely come in handy in certain situations where things become more prolonged.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bear Pepper Spray – Where to Buy</h2>
A few different options for where to buy bear pepper spray.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Pepper Spray</a> - This is a 290 gram container of bear pepper spray. The 290 gram size will <strong>spray for about 9.2 seconds</strong>, which should be plenty for most bear encounters. It will also <strong>go somewhere between 12 and 32 feet</strong>, affording you plenty of distance between you and the bear. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">230 gram size</a> that is smaller and lighter, but also doesn't last quite as long and goes just slightly less far.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Counter Assault Bear Pepper Spray Holster</a> - <strong>Bear spray is only effective if you can get it out and up quickly</strong>, which is why a bear spray holster is such a good idea to have. It sits right on your belt or even backpack hip belt, and puts the bear pepper spray within hand's reach at all times. Definitely an important bear pepper spray accessory to have.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-spray-deterrent\">Counter Assault Bear Pepper Spray Package</a> - If you want a can of bear pepper spray and holster you can save a few dollars with this <strong>package deal</strong> from an alternative retailer. You have the <strong>option of either the 290 or 230 gram size</strong>.</li>

A <strong>down jacket with hood</strong> will keep you quite a bit warmer than one without a hood, for the simple reason that you lose a lot of body heat from your head. When you cover that area up, then, you retain all of that body heat. But the other thing that hoods get used for, protecting your head from rain, you should definitely not be using a hooded down jacket for, because you should do whatever you can to keep your down jacket from getting wet. Wet down doesn’t insulate very well.
<h2>Down Jacket with Hood</h2>
What to look for when you want a down jacket with hood.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – First and foremost, you should make sure that any down jacket with a hood you get is water resistant. If you ever end up using that hood to fend off any rain, you will need to prevent the down inside from getting wet, and a water resistant shell is the best way to do that.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – The other big variable when it comes to down jackets, with or without hoods, is the quality of the down. If you’re a backpacker, hiker or anyone else who might be carrying your down jacket in a backpack, you should know <!--more-->that higher quality down will both weigh less and compress down better than the low quality stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Jacket with Hood</h2>
Some of the very best down jackets with hoods, for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoody Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - If you want something <strong>lightweight and thin</strong> that you can stay active in when the temperature dips just a little, the Ultralight Down Hoody is perfect. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, plus a <strong>water resistant exterior</strong> that will help keep the down dry. The hood will keep your head warm, and there are a couple of zippered hand pockets for your hands. It's lightweight and close fitting with a low profile, but then it's designed to be ultralight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-men-s\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-women-s\">Women's</a>) - This parka from Mont Bell does a good job of being warm and still functional for all kinds of technical pursuits. It's quite a bit thicker than the Patagonia option above, which will <strong>keep you warm down to much lower temperatures</strong>. It <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a very good option for staying warm. Besides a hood it has a couple of hand warmer pockets, plus a few thoughtful features like a <strong>fleece lined collar</strong> that will help to keep you warm. The jacket uses <strong>800+ fill down and a water resistant treatment</strong> on the exterior.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Expedition Down Parka is the hooded down jacket that you want for those truly cold days. It's a been a <strong>favorite with the staff at the McMurdo research facility in Antarctica for the last 20 years</strong>, to give you an idea of just how warm you can expect to stay inside it. It uses <strong>quality 625+ fill duck down</strong>, not goose down, and a whole lot of it. There's also a few nice features like a <strong>fur lined hood and a couple of fleece lined pockets</strong> that will further help to keep you toasty warm inside. So a down jacket with hood for when you really need to stay warm.</li>

But you do have quite a few decisions to make when choosing an outdoor sleeping bag, many of which will depend on exactly what you will be doing, and where you will be doing it. Backpacking in winter, for example, will require a lightweight sleeping bag that wont weigh you down, but that has a low enough minimum temperature to keep you warm.
<h2>Outdoor Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of what to look for when reviewing outdoor sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Minimum Temperature</strong> – Part of what you need to decide on when getting an outdoor sleeping bag is the minimum temperature. Of course for that, you need to find out what kind of temperatures you will be finding yourself in, and then you need to pick out a sleeping bag that has a minimum temperature rating that will keep you warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Down or Synthetic</strong> – You also need to decide on what kind of insulation you want. Down is lighter and compresses better, which is good for backpackers and hikers. But<!--more--> synthetic insulation is better when it gets wet, and more importantly to some, synthetic insulation also tends to cost less than down.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Outdoor Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best outdoor sleeping bags, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-hugger-1-sleeping-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - If you need a <strong>4 season outdoor sleeping bag</strong> then a sleeping bag like this one from Mont Bell, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, is ideal. It uses <strong>800+ fill down, and a water resistant exterior</strong> to keep you and the sleeping bag dry. It also has a few other things, like a draft collar and a zipper tube, that will help to keep you warm. And at just <strong>2 pound 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong> it's fantastically lightweight, and ideal for camping or backpacking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - For summer or warmer spring and fall weather, the HighLite, which has a <strong>minimum temperature of 35 degrees</strong> is a great choice. It uses the very high quality <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, plus a unique design with large, square baffles to get down to just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong> for the regular length version. This is an ideal sleeping bag for backpackers and campers looking for something lightweight to get them through warmer nights.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747887/mountain-hardwear-ultralamina-45-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Ultralamina</a> - If you're going to be out in warm weather then the Ultralamina, which has a very cool <strong>minimum temperature of 45 degrees</strong>, will keep you warm. It's probably not much good for fall or spring in most parts of the world, but when temperatures are high you don't need much to stay warm. It's a <strong>synthetic sleeping bag</strong>, not down, and mummy shaped. It weighs in at <strong>1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>, which is notably heavier than the warmer, but more expensive HighLite above.</li>

Larger tents can be useful if you’re going with a group, and especially a group that doesn’t have their own tents, but with a 1 person tent you always, at least, can put a shelter over your own head, regardless of whether you are going solo or with a larger group. And if you get a lightweight 1 person tent, you also don’t have to get stuck carrying someone else’s heavy tent.
<h2>1 Person Tent</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a 1 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re getting a 1 person tent then there’s no chance of offloading that tent on someone else. You’re going to have to carry it. So you might as well make it a lightweight tent. Fortunately 1 person tents don’t need to be big, and some are small enough that they weigh hardly anything at all.</li>
	<li><strong>Season</strong> – If you’re going out in the winter then it’s a good idea to have a four season tent. You can make do with a three season tent, but you have to really pick your campsite, and<!--more--> also hope that you’re not unlucky enough to be out in a storm. So for winter camping, a four season 1 person tent is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 1 Person Tent</h2>
Some of the very best 1 person tents for those solo camping trips.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-gogo-elite-tent-1-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Gogo Elite Tent</a> - The Gogo is an ideal tent for when it's just you. It's a <strong>cross between a bivy sack and a tent</strong>, and has just enough room inside for you to lay down. The door does have a screen, however, so you can ventilate the small space as long as it's not raining too hard outside. <strong>Rather than a pole it actually has an inflatable tube</strong>, which is what adds structure. So there's no pole to carry, and also no pole to break and have to replace. So a small 1 person tent with a tiny footprint, ideal for those solo adventures. It <strong>weighs 1 pound 7 ounces, or 652 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1 Tent</a> - The Fly Creek is one of the better free standing 1 person tents on the market. The <strong>2 person version won the 2010 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and this 1 person version uses all of the same excellent design features, just in a smaller package. It has plenty of ventilation, and just enough room inside to sit up, but like the Gogo above this is a tent designed to be lightweight. And at just <strong>1 pound 14 ounces, or 850 grams</strong>, it certainly does not disappoint in that area.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is an entirely different kind of 1 person tent. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, first of all, but gives you <strong>a whole lot of ventilation</strong> options to make sure condensation doesn't build up too much. It also gives you <strong>the option of using trekking poles as the tent poles</strong>, so that you can leave the optional pole at home. It's also a relatively cheap option, and <strong>weighs just 24.5 ounces, which is 700 grams</strong>.</li>

Each has positives and negatives associated with it, though <strong>stainless steel camping pots</strong> do have a few things going for them which definitely make them an attractive choice. For one, stainless steel is strong and durable, and not all that expensive, compared to something like titanium. The main disadvantage of stainless steel camping pots is that they tend to be heavier than both aluminum and titanium camping pots.
<h2>Stainless Steel Camping Pots</h2>
What to look for when reviewing stainless steel camping pots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – One of the basic decisions you need to make when picking out a camping pot is the size of the pot. If you’re going to be cooking for just yourself then you don’t need a particularly big pot, but if you’re cooking for more people, you might want to invest in a bigger pot, or even a set of pots for various group sizes.</li>
	<li><strong>Lid / Pan</strong> – Many camping pots come with a lid that can double as a frying pan. This kind of lid is often a little bigger and better built than just a normal pot lid. The upside<!--more--> to that extra weight, however, is that you get a second piece of cookware for those gourmet camping meals that require more than just a pot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Stainless Steel Camping Pots</h2>
Some of the very best stainless steel camping pots.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/601897/msr-stowaway-pot-1600ml\">MSR Stowaway Pot</a> - If all you need is one pot, then the Stowaway is a good choice. It has a <strong>1.6 liter capacity</strong>, and a handle that turns in to a lid lock when you need to store the pot. At <strong>19.5 ounces, or 552 grams</strong> it's not the lightest pot, even for stainless steel which is relatively heavy, but it gets the job done, and would be ideal for those times when you don't have to worry about carrying gear too much.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/personal-cooker-1-3pc\">Snow Peak Personal Cooker</a> - The Snow Peak Personal Cooker is a stainless steel camping pot built more with saving weight in mind. The <strong>pot comes with a lid, along with another piece of plateware so that you have a pot, a lid and a bowl and a plate</strong> all at your disposal. Best of all, the <strong>whole sets weighs just 8.5 ounces, or 240 grams</strong>, which is considerably better than the Stowaway above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-alpine-2-stainless-steel-pot-set\">MSR Alpine 2</a> - If you would prefer a set, then the Alpine 2 is an ideal choice. It comes with <strong>a 1.5 liter and 2 liter pot, and one lid that will work for either size</strong>, and will even <strong>double as a pan if you really need one</strong>. There are no attached handles, but the set <strong>comes with a pot gripper</strong> that will work with any piece of the set.

For starters, it takes less battery power to power a red LED than it does to power a white LED. So you end up saving power with a red LED headlamp. Red light also doesn’t spoil your night vision, so that when you turn your headlamp off, you will still be able to see whatever you can see with the ambient light, rather than being temporarily blind until your eyes adjust.
<h2>Red LED Headlamp</h2>
What to look for when you want a red LED headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>LED or Cover</strong> – Many headlamps give you the option of a red cover or lens that you can snap in to place over a white LED. This will help with night vision, but will not, obviously, give you the other advantage of a red LED, which is the battery power saved by using a red LED over a white LED. So find out if you’re using an actual red LED or if there’s just a red lens.</li>
	<li><strong>Power Profiles</strong> – One of the more useful features of headlamps, regardless of their color, is the different power options that many come with. You get a high power setting for when you need a lot of light, and a low power setting <!--more-->for when you need only a small amount of light. Many headlamps come with both red and white LEDs, and make it so that you can switch between the two by changing the power setting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Red LED Headlamp</h2>
Some of the very best red LED headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-zipka-plus-2-headlamp\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2</a> - The Zipka is an ideal headlamp for those that want to save on weight and bulk. It weighs a <strong>very slim 2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>, and even has a <strong>retractable head strap</strong> so that it fits right in your pocket. It has<strong> one red LED</strong> that will help you save your night vision and save batteries too. In fact it w<strong>ill go for 150 hours on the lowest power setting, and will put out an impressive 70 lumens</strong> on the highest setting.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791312/petzl-tikka-plus-2-led-headlamp\">Petzl Tikka Plus 2</a> - The Tikka 2 is very similar to the Zipka above, but is designed with a standard headband, and more of a traditional headlamp feel. It has <strong>a red LED built in</strong>, of course, which will give you about 100 hours of use, though you can get <strong>140 out of the lowest power setting</strong>. And <strong>on high, you can expect about 50 lumens</strong>, which is more than enough for most uses. With batteries, the whole thing <strong>weighs 2.9 ounces, or 82 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm</a> - The Storm is a headlamp built for storms. It's <strong>waterproof</strong>, for starters, and will put out an <strong>impressive 100 lumens</strong>, which is the kind of brightness you need in bad weather. It has <strong>2 red LEDs</strong>, rather than just one, so you can have a good look around with the red light mode on. On the lowest power setting you will also get a very <strong>impressive 200 hours of battery life</strong>. So a red LED headlamp that is ideally suited for a wide range of conditions.</li>

Unfortunately, bear canisters can be rather heavy, and so finding an <strong>ultralight bear canister</strong> can be very useful. It saves you from carrying a lot of unnecessary weight around, which is never a fun thing to do when backpacking or camping. Just be sure, of course, that you get a bear canister that will do the job of keeping your food safe from bears.
<h2>Ultralight Bear Canister</h2>
What to look for when you want an ultralight bear canister.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Approved</strong> – If you plan on using your bear canister in a national park, where they are often required, you need to be sure that the bear canister you buy is approved for use there. All of the bear canisters below are approved as of this writing, but that can change if there is evidence that a bear has successfully gotten in to one of these canisters.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Obviously, the ultralight bear canister you buy has to be big enough to fit all of the food<!--more--> that you plan to take. On the other hand, a smaller bear canister will be lighter, all other things being equal. So pay close attention to the capacity of the bear canister that you buy, and how it compares to your food storage needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Bear Canister</h2>
There aren't many to choose from, but these are some of the very best ultralight bear canisters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\">Bear Vault BV500</a> - When it comes to ultralight bear canisters there are few better than the BV500. At <strong>2.56 pounds, or 1.16 kilograms</strong> it's a definite ultralight choice, and offers <strong>11.5 liters of storage space</strong>, which is enough for <strong>6 or 7 days of food</strong> and just shy of being the largest bear canister on this list. It also has a relatively large opening, and clear sides, so that you can see where your food is, rather than having to dig to find it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - The Bear Keg is the largest bear canister on this list, with <strong>11.7 liters of capacity</strong>. Unfortunately it's also the heaviest by far, at <strong>4 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.92 kilograms</strong>. The opening also isn't especially large. But <strong>what it does have going for it is that it's yellow</strong>. Bear sometimes like to drag a bear canister away from your camp, and a yellow bear canister is very easy to find in the morning. So very visible, but definitely not much of an ultralight bear canister.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768901/bearvault-bv450-solo-food-container\">Bear Vault BV450</a> - The BV450 is the same basic design as the BV500 above, but with a smaller capacity. With <strong>7.2 liters of space</strong> it has enough <strong>room for about 4 days of food</strong>, depending on what you're packing and how much you're eating.  But it weighs a very reasonable <strong>2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>, so if you don't need enough capacity for a week of food you can save a few ounces by going with a smaller, and more ultralight bear canister like this one.</li>

But if your sleeping bag doesn’t come with its own compression sack, it’s a little piece of gear that is definitely worth investing in. One of the best things about sleeping bags, after all, is that they compress down very small, so that when you need to stuff your sleeping bag in to your backpack in the morning, you can do it with as little bulk as possible.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Compression Sack</h2>
What to look for when you want a sleeping bag compression sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – Obviously, a bigger sleeping bag will require a bigger compression sack. You should try and find a size that you think will more or less fit your sleeping bag. Keep in mind, of course, that a compression sack that is slightly too big is workable, but a compression sack that is slightly too small isn’t going to be of much help to you.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Many compression sacks are also waterproof, which is never a bad thing. You definitely do not want to get <!--more-->the insulation inside your sleeping bag wet, after all, because wet insulation wont keep you as warm as dry insulation. Even a water resistant compression sack is better than nothing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Compression Sack</h2>
Some of the very best sleeping bag compression sacks.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/766677/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-compression-sack\">Sea to Summit Ultra Sil Compression Sack</a> - This is a <strong>nylon, siliconized compression sack</strong>, which makes it a tough, <strong>water resistant</strong> option. It comes in a wide range of sizes, <strong>from 6 liters all the way up to 30 liters</strong>, so there is a size that will work with whatever size of sleeping you have. It uses a <strong>drawcord enclosure on top</strong>, and the 15 liter version weighs 3 ounces, or 85 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-event-compression-dry-sack\">Sea to Summit eVent Compression Dry Sack</a> - eVent makes an ideal fabric for a sleeping bag compression sack, and this is a very good one. It <strong>won the 2007 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, for starters. It also comes in <strong>5 different sizes</strong>, the <strong>smallest being 6 liters and the largest being 30 liters</strong>. It uses a roll top enclosure and the 14 liter version weighs 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams, to give you an idea of weight. But what really makes this an ideal choice for sleeping bags is that <strong>eVent is both waterproof and breathable</strong>, so you can be sure your sleeping bag will stay dry.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/round-rock-solid-compression-sack\">Granite Gear Round Rock Solid Compression Sack</a> - The Round Rock Solid is a good, if basic compression sack. It's <strong>made with just straight nylon, so it's not waterproof or even water resistant</strong>. It does come in 7 different sizes, however, the <strong>smallest being 7.8 liters and the largest being 57 liters</strong>. The 16 liter version weighs 5.1 ounces, or 144 grams. So no protection from water, but it will at least do the job of compressing your sleeping bag.</li>

A <strong>bivy tent</strong> is a bivy sack with some rudimentary amount of support. One thing that many people don’t really like about a bivy sack, after all, is that it lays on your sleeping bag, which can lead to problems like puddles in bad weather. With a bivy tent you don’t have to worry about that as much, and can rely on your bivy in much the same way that you would a tent.
<h2>Bivy Tent</h2>
What to look for when reviewing a bivy tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – The main advantage of a bivy sack over a tent is that it weighs quite a bit less. So while you may want a bit of extra support with a bivy tent, you should try not to go with a heavy bivy tent, because if you’re going to do that you might as well just go with a tent. Fortunately, there are some excellent, lightweight bivy tents out there.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The material that your bivy tent is made out of matters. Because there is so little room inside a bivy tent, and <!--more-->little opportunity for weatherproof ventilation, you need a fabric that will both keep water out and also breath well. Gore Tex is one option, but it is by no means the only option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bivy Tent</h2>
Some of the very best bivy tents, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747832/outdoor-research-alpine-bivy\">Outdoor Research Alpine Bivy</a> - The Alpine is <strong>less a tent and much more a bivy</strong>. It has the same basic design and shape as a bivy does, but with a single pole across the upper chest which elevates the bivy and gives you a bit of breathing room. The whole thing is made from <strong>3 layer Gore Tex on top</strong>, to give you breathable but waterproof protection from the elements, while the <strong>bottom is waterproof nylon</strong>, to protect from ground water. The opening is also big and covered in mesh, so that ventilation is easy, provided that it's not raining. It weighs <strong>2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-sprite-1-tent-1-person-3-season\">Mountain Hardwear Sprite 1</a> - The Sprite is a <strong>small, enclosed tent</strong> that shares many things with a bivy but more resembles a tent. It has a <strong>mesh interior and a rain fly, for starters, and two poles</strong>, on hooped across the top and a smaller at the bottom, to provide structure. The rain fly even creates a small vestibule where you could store a few things, like shoes. The whole thing weighs <strong>2 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.33 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gogo-ex-tent-1-person-3-season\">Nemo Gogo EX Tent</a> - The Gogo is the ideal combination of tent and bivy sack. Like many other Nemo tents it actually <strong>uses an inflatable tube, rather than a pole</strong>, to provide structure. But despite it's small size it actually uses a <strong>mesh interior and a removable rain fly</strong>, which makes it ideal for ventilating that small space. The rain fly also creates a small vestibule space where you can store a few things you want to keep dry for morning, like shoes. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2 pounds 8 ounces, or 1.13 kilograms</strong>.</li>

So getting <strong>good hiking shoes</strong> is important, especially if you want to enjoy the hiking experience. Fortunately, there are plenty of very good hiking shoes out there to choose from.
<h2>Good Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you want good hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathable</strong> – If you want something waterproof there are waterproof hiking shoes, but then if you expect to be getting wet a lot, you may be better off with boots. Good hiking shoes will allow air to circulate around your feet, so that they don’t get too sweaty, which can be the start of a variety of foot problems.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Good hiking shoes are generally lightweight hiking shoes. Every pound on your feet is equal to about five on your back, in terms of your energy expended, and so it pays to<!--more--> have lightweight hiking shoes that wont tire you out too much. Being exhausted halfway through a hike, after all, does not make for a good second half.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good Hiking Shoes Reviews</h2>
A few pairs of good hiking shoes for men and women.
<h3><strong>Good Hiking Shoes for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829185/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-mens\">New Balance MT10 Minimus</a> - First, a very minimalist, as the name suggests, pair of hiking shoes from New Balance. They're <strong>not waterproof, in fact they're extremely breathable</strong>. They're also <strong>low cut, and have a relatively thin Vibram sole</strong> with provides just a minimal amount of padding between you and the ground. They're simple and lightweight, and <strong>good hiking shoes for those warm days</strong> when you don't have to worry too much about cold, wet feet. They weigh in at about <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-mens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR Shoes</a> - The Hedgehogs from North Face are the opposite of the Minimus shoes above. They use a <strong>XCR Gore Tex liner</strong> to provide waterproofing and keep your feet dry, though the upper is also mostly mesh, which doesn't do much to keep water out, but does help your feet breath well. The <strong>sole is a much more rugged Vibram sole</strong>. So another pair of good hiking shoes that are much better suited to bad weather.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Good Hiking Shoes for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814347/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-womens\">New Balance WT10 Minimus</a> - The Minimus shoes are, as the name suggests, a <strong>pair of hiking shoes built with minimalism in mind</strong>. There really isn't much to them. The <strong>uppers are mostly just mesh</strong>, to facilitate as much ventilation as possible, while the sole is fairly thin and will provide <strong>only a small amount of cushion, though it is a Vibram sole</strong>, so you can count on it to keep you on your feet. But a fairly basic, minimal and lightweight pair of hiking shoes ideal for those hot, sunny summer days. The pair <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-womens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR Shoes</a> - The Hedgehogs are what you want when the weather is not warm and sunny. They come with a <strong>XCR Gore Tex liner</strong>, which will do an excellent job of keeping your feet nice and dry when the weather turns bad. And the <strong>sole is a much more aggressive offering from Vibram</strong>, when compared to the sole of the Minimus shoes above. These are designed to weather bad weather and bad trails with ease. But at <strong>21.8 ounces, or 620 grams</strong> they do weigh almost exactly twice what the Minimum shoes weigh.</li>

You can survive on cold food, after all, but a good, hot meal at the end of the day is a whole lot more satisfying than digging in to something cold. But before you go and buy a portable camping stove you need to make a few decisions, because camping stoves come in all different shapes and sizes.
<h2>Portable Camping Stove</h2>
What to look at when reviewing a portable camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Source</strong> – One of the bigger differences between various camping stoves is the fuel source. Some will work with wood, which you can find at your campsite, or even alcohol, which is easy to find and cheap. But the two most popular options are canister stoves that run on propane canisters and then liquid fuel stoves.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Another important difference between any two stoves is the weight of the stove. If you’re car camping then you’re<!--more--> probably not concerned, but if you’re putting that stove in a backpack you will likely be a lot happier with a lightweight stove that you will hardly even notice you’re carrying.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Portable Camping Stove</h2>
Some of the best portable camping stoves in a few different categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/junior-stove\">Littlbug Junior Stove</a> - The Junior from Littlbug is an ideal stove for backpacking or those looking for something a little simpler in a hiking stove. It <strong>will work with wood or other solid fuels like Esbit tablets, and will also work with alcohol</strong>, which a favorite fuel of many backpackers. It's <strong>made of stainless steel</strong>, and the whole thing <strong>weighs just 5.1 ounces, or 144 grams</strong>, which is rather good when you consider that your fuel might already be waiting for you at your campsite.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-pocket-rocket-stove\">MSR Pocket Rocket Stove</a> - The Pocket Rocket is a fantastic little <strong>canister stove</strong>. At just <strong>3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, it's best feature is its lightweight design. It's made with steel, and you can expect about <strong>60 minutes of burn time</strong> with a full canister from the Pocket Rocket. You can also expect to <strong>boil water in approximately 3.5 minutes</strong>. So a fantastically lightweight and very portable camping stove.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/709002/msr-dragonfly-backpacking-stove\">MSR DragonFly Stove</a> - Another very portable camping stove from MSR, this one intended for use with <strong>liquid fuels, specifically white gas, kerosene, gasoline, and diesel, among a few others</strong>. The burn time varies, depending on the fuel, but averages around 30 minutes, while the <strong>time to boil also varies, but is roughly 4 minutes</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs in at 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, so it's not the lightest camping stove out there, but it's versatile when it comes to fuel choice and a very popular camping stove.</li>

	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – If what your worried about is water finding its way down in to your boots then you definitely want a good pair of waterproof hiking gaiters. But if water is only a minor concern then water resistant gaiters will likely get the job done, and will breath better too.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle or Calf</strong> – You have a couple of choices when it comes to the length of your gaiters. The calf length <!--more-->gaiters are good for when things get wet, but if all you’re worried about is debris, a pair of ankle gaiters is likely enough, and will even keep out some water, if you ever need them for that too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Gaiter Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a few of the very best hiking gaiters to keep your feet happy.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - The Hispar gaiters are an ideal <strong>full length gaiter</strong> for general hiking. They're made with<strong> 3-layer eVent</strong>, a fabric similar to Gore Tex but with a reputation of being more breathable, and thus an excellent option for hiking gaiters. The <strong>bottom portion is 600D ballistic polyester</strong>, which is tough enough to stand up to abuse, but not the heavy duty 1000D nylon that you find on mountaineering gaiters. So an excellent pair of general hiking gaiters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/725915/outdoor-research-crocodile-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - The Crocodile gaiters are more of a <strong>true mountaineering gaiter. They use heavy 3 layer Gore Tex</strong> for the top portion, and <strong>1000D cordura nylon for the bottom section</strong>. What helps separate these out from the competition is that they've <strong>been around since at least 1999, which is when they won a Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>. So a very solid pair of gaiters with a long history of satisfying customers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiter</a> - If you would prefer <strong>ankle length gaiters</strong> to full length calf gaiters, then the Latok Mids are a great choice. They're very similar to the Hispar gaiters above, which are also made by Rab. They use the same <strong>3 layer eVent</strong> on the top portion to keep your feet dry, and<strong> 500D cordura nylon on the bottom</strong> to withstand the use and abuse that the boot portion of gaiters often endures. So very well built and durable pair of ankle length hiking gaiters.</li>

It works well, but it’s also not the only option. <strong>Tunnel tents</strong> are another popular shape that do very well for a few different reasons, particularly for 4 season camping. For one, the round tunnel shape makes them well suited to strong winds. And being round they also shed moisture very well. But perhaps the biggest advantage of a tunnel tent is that you get a lot of overhead room, which makes for a roomy tent inside.
<h2>Tunnel Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing tunnel tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As with any other tent, one thing that you need to consider is the weight of any tunnel tents you are considering. If you’re going to be carrying this tent, after all, it’s in your own interest to get a lightweight tunnel tent. That way, you wont have to be carrying a big, heavy tent around with you.</li>
	<li><strong>Season</strong> – The tunnel tent design makes it ideally suited to four season weather. Which is not to say that you couldn’t use a tunnel tent in summer conditions, but just that a tunnel tent might be overdoing <!--more-->it for three season camping. So consider when you will be using your tent when deciding on a tunnel tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Tunnel Tents</h2>
There aren't many, but here are some of the best tunnel tents.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/widi-2-tent-2-person-3-season\">Marmot Widi</a> - The Widi is a great, modern take on the classic tunnel tent design. Like most tunnel tents it's meant to survive in all <strong>four seasons</strong>. There's <strong>30.6 square feet of floor space, which is enough for 2 people</strong>, and is designed with an inner wall and a rain fly, so that you can get some extra ventilation when there's no chance of rain or snow. There's also some vestibule space, but just one door. The whole thing <strong>weighs 7 pounds 7 ounces, or 3.37 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/orion-2-tent-green\">Exped Orion</a> - The Orion is a tunnel tent with a third pole arching across the two tunnel portions, which provides a bit more strength and plenty of vestibule room at each of the two doors. Inside there is <strong>29 square feet of floor space, which enough room for two to sleep</strong>, and you are protected from the elements by a<strong>n inner wall and a removable rain fly</strong>. Just like the other two tunnel tents on this list, this is a <strong>four season tent</strong>, ideal for the worst winter conditions. The whole thing weighs <strong>8.2 pounds, or 3.7 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-dragontail-tent-2-person-4-season\">MSR Dragontail</a> - The Dragontail is a<strong> true four season, tunnel tent</strong>. It uses <strong>three tunnel ribs</strong>, instead of two, to provide you with even more structural strength. It's also a <strong>single wall design</strong>, but has overhead ventilation so that you wont have to worry about condensation. There's <strong>36 square feet of floor space, which is plenty of room for 2 people</strong>, plus winter backpacking or camping gear, plus some vestibule space for keeping things dry. It also <strong>weighs just 4 pounds 12 ounces, or 2.15 kilograms</strong>, which is due in large part to the single wall design. So a serious tunnel tent for seriously bad weather.</li>

Of course, there are also a few different kinds of gas used. White gas, for instance, is a popular fuel source for camping stoves, but some stoves will also work with basic gasoline. Some stoves, of course, work with a wide variety of fuels, making them a versatile and useful option for camping.
<h2>Gas Camping Stove</h2>
What to look for when shopping for gas camping stoves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Multiple Fuels</strong> – A stove that will work with white gas or gasoline is good, but a stove that will work with both, and more fuels besides is even better. Fortunately for you, many camping stoves will work with several different kinds of fuel, so if you don’t have easy access to one fuel, you might have access to another.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – All stoves will do the same basic job of cooking your food, but many will weigh considerably more than others. If you’re going to be carrying that stove around, it’s in your best interest to try and find a lightweight gas camping <!--more-->stove, so that you still have some energy left over at the end of the day to cook your meal.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gas Camping Stove</h2>
Some of the very best gas camping stoves to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/709002/msr-dragonfly-backpacking-stove\">MSR DragonFly</a> - The DragonFly is a great little camping stove that runs on a <strong>few different fuels, including white gas, kerosene and gasoline</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, so it's not the lightest gas stove out there, but it provides excellent stability and packs down small when you're done with it, which are definitely things to appreciate in a stove. The DragonFly will <strong>boil water in approximately 4 minutes</strong>, depending on the specific fuel.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-whisperlite-stove\">MSR WhisperLite</a> - If you want a lightweight gas stove, this is about as good as you are going to do. At <strong>11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong> it's a great little stove. It only <strong>burns one fuel, however, and that is white gas</strong>, so you do sacrifice some amount of versatility for that lightweight design. It will also <strong>boil water in roughly 3.9 minutes</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/xgk-ex-stove\">MSR XGK EX</a> - The XGK's main feature is that it will burn just about any liquid fuel that you put in it, including <strong>white gas, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and more</strong>. It's a truly versatile stove. And at <strong>13.2 ounces, or 375 grams</strong> it's also relatively lightweight. It also <strong>boils impressively quickly, at just 3.5 minutes</strong>. So the most expensive gas camping stove on this list, but also one of, if not the best.</li>

Certainly, one of the more important ways for a headlamp to be the <strong>most powerful headlamp</strong> is brightness. The power light a headlamp can put out, the more useful it might be in a wide variety of circumstances. A headlamp with the most powerful battery, however, can also last a lot longer than the average headlamp, and will give you light for potentially hundreds of hours.
<h2>Most Powerful Headlamp</h2>
What to look at when you want the most powerful headlamp possible.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – If you’re looking for the headlamp that can put out the most light, then what you want is a headlamp with a high lumens measurement. The higher the lumens are for a headlamp, the more light you will be able to get from it, and the more illuminated the area in front of you will be.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – A super bright headlamp isn’t of much use to you if it wont last for more than an hour or two. Which is why it’s important to get a bright headlamp that also has a big, powerful <!--more-->battery if what you want is the most powerful headlamp. That way you get lots of light for as long as possible, which is the best combination.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Most Powerful Headlamp Reviews</h2>
A few quick reviews of some of the most powerful headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra</a> - The Ultra is an extremely powerful headlamp. With <strong>350 lumens of light</strong> on the highest power setting, you can expect to <strong>see 120 meters in front of you</strong>. At that setting, however, you only get 2 hours of battery life, and <strong>only 17 hours of battery life on the lowest power setting</strong>. So this is a headlamp with lots of brightness, but not as much battery life. Fortunately, the <strong>battery is rechargeable</strong>, so you wont have to invest in bulk AAAs. It weighs 12.2 ounces, which is 345 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-pro-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Pro</a> - The Apex Pro puts out a <strong>very respectable 200 lumens</strong> of light, and <strong>will last for 100 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>, so it's a good combination of battery power and light power. It's also <strong>completely waterproof</strong>, which is actually not that common in headlamps. Compared to the Ultra it's also quite light, at just 6.1 ounces, which is 172 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/x-shot-headlamp\">Mammut X-Shot</a> - The X-Shot is an impressive headlamp in a few different categories. First, at <strong>5.2 ounces, which is 150 grams it's the lightest headlamp</strong> on this list. It's also capable of <strong>putting out 200 lumens</strong>, but unlike any of the other headlamps, can<strong> last for an amazing 500 hours</strong> on the lowest battery setting, which has more to do with the minimalism of that low power setting than any special batteries. So one of the most impressive and powerful headlamps out there.</li>

Bear pepper spray that is stuck in your bag might as well be back at home for all the good it is going to do you when a bear charges you. Which is why if you’re going to get a can of bear pepper spray, you should get a <strong>bear spray holster</strong> to go with it. That way the bear spray can sit on your belt or somewhere else close by, and be quickly accessed when you do need it.
<h2>Bear Spray Holster</h2>
What to look for when buying a bear spray holster.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Accessibility</strong> – When shopping for bear spray holsters pay close attention to how fast you are able to access the bear spray. If you need to be undoing complex straps to get your bear spray out, what are the chances, realistically, that you will be able to get that bear spray out when it matters. You want your bear spray to be as accessible as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Compatible</strong> – Not all bear spray cans are made equal, and many bear spray holsters will be made to work with a certain brand of bear spray, and maybe even a certain can size. Most manufacturers of bear spray will also make holsters, so it’s <!--more-->usually easiest to look for a holster from the same brand of your bear spray.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Bear Spray Holster</h2>
Some of the best choices for a bear spray holster.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray Holster</a> - This is a basic belt holster that <strong>will work with either</strong> the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">230 gram</a> or <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">290 gram</a> size of counter assault bear spray. It will strap on to your belt or even a backpack hip belt if that's more convenient. There's <strong>just a simple velcro strap</strong> that holds the bear spray in place, so all you need to do to get at the bear spray can is rip back the velcro and remove the bear spray. Easy and convenient.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/694797/counter-assault-chest-holster\">Counter Assault Chest Holster</a> - This is the same Counter Assault holster above, but <strong>with a second strap that will allow you to secure it to the center of your chest or else to the strap of a backpack</strong>. A useful little addition if you would prefer not to carry your bear spray on your belt.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-spray-deterrent\">Counter Assault Bear Spray Deterrent Package</a> - If you don't already have a can of bear spray then this is convenient package from Counter Assault. It <strong>comes with either the 230 gram or 290 gram size of bear spray, plus the appropriate belt holster</strong>, so that you have everything you need to go exploring in bear country.</li>

Many people actually use a sleeping  bag cover in place of a tent, or in combination with a tarp tent, to provide the same functionality that a tent does, but without all the added bulk and weight that a tent necessitates. There is, however, quite a wide variety of choice when it comes to sleeping bags covers.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Cover</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a sleeping bag cover.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Some sleeping bag covers are waterproof and some aren’t. Many are actually waterproof on the bottom, to keep out ground water, and water resistant on the top, to keep water out, but also allow some breathability, so that you don’t end up sweating inside the cover. Decide whether you need your sleeping bag cover to be waterproof or not.</li>
	<li><strong>Mesh Screen</strong> – Just about all sleeping bag covers come with hole where your face ends up being, that both gives you access to fresh air while you sleep and also acts as an entry and exit point for the sleeping bag cover. If you’re <!--more-->going to be hiking in a place with plenty of bugs, it helps to have this hole covered in mesh, to keep those bugs at bay.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Cover</h2>
Some of the better options for a sleeping bag cover.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794292/rei-minimalist-bivy-sack-regular\">REI Minimalist Bivy Sack</a> - The Minimalist from REI is a great choice if you want a value oriented sleeping bag cover. It's <strong>nylon on both the top and bottom, which is coated with REI's waterproof and breathable REI Elements product</strong>. The face is covered by a mesh screen too, so you wont suffer from bugs at night while truing to sleep. It also comes with a large zippered portion on the top, with 6 zippers, so you can create a few gaps for ventilating, which is a great little feature. The whole thing <strong>weighs 15 ounces, which is 425 grams</strong>. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794291/rei-minimalist-bivy-long\">long size</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-ac-bivy\">MSR AC Bivy</a> - Another sleeping bag cover, this time from MSR. This one has a <strong>waterproof and windproof coated nylon top portion, while the bottom portion is just water resistant</strong>. The face opening is also covered with mesh, so that you will be safe from bugs at night while trying to sleep. The whole thing also <strong>weighs just 1 pound, which is 453 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-lite-bivi\">Rab Alpine Lite Bivi</a> - One more sleeping bag cover, this time from Rab. The Alpine Lite uses a <strong>waterproof bathtub floor, which is combined with a very highly breathable eVent upper portion, eVent being a superior choice to coated nylon</strong>, so that you stay dry while allowing for plenty of ventilation, making it an ideal cover for your sleeping bag. The opening on this cover is actually a<strong> U-shaped zipper along the top edge of the bivy</strong>, so it gives you a much more complete way to get out of the elements, though no bug mesh. The Alpine Lite <strong>weighs 15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong>.</li>

There aren’t, unfortunately, too many lightweight double sleeping pads out there, so if you’re thinking that you’re going to be saving a significant amount of weight, like you would with a 2 person tent, you’re better off going with two single person sleeping pads. But for getting cozy, a double sleeping pad is an ideal solution.
<h2>Double Sleeping Pad</h2>
What you want to look for from a double sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foam or Inflatable</strong> – There aren’t too many double sleeping pads out there, but you still need to decide on whether you want a foam or an inflatable sleeping pad. Inflatable sleeping pads are ideal for one person, but with two people, one person moving around might end up disturbing the sleep of the other.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – Another thing to consider when buying a double sleeping pad is the R-value. R-value is a measurement of the warmth that your sleeping pad will reflect. In winter, a sleeping pad with a high R-value, which<!--more--> means it will reflect a lot of body heat, is a very useful piece of gear to have.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Double Sleeping Pad</h2>
There aren't many of them, but here are some of the best double sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/748726/exped-multimat-sleeping-mat\">Exped MultiMat Sleeping Mat</a> - The MultiMat is a very versatile piece gear that can be used as a sitting mat for lunch on cold wet ground, as a way to keep gear dry or even as a very thin double sleeping pad. And it really is <strong>quite thin, at just 2 millimeters</strong>, plus a nylon cover on one side. So not the most comfortable sleeping pad, but for warm summer conditions it might be acceptable. It <strong>weighs 12 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-down-coupler\">Therm-A-Rest Down Coupler</a> - This is <strong>a coupler from Therm-A-Rest, which means it attaches two sleeping pads together</strong>, and is not, itself, a sleeping pad. It does, however, add quite a bit of warmth to a sleeping pad, since it is <strong>stuffed with 650 fill down</strong>. So not a sleeping pad, but a very useful piece of gear for winter camping or backpacking. It comes in three different sizes to accommodate different sizes of sleeping pads, with the <strong>large weighing 1 pound 7 ounces, or 652 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/cosmo-pillowtop-1-2-person\">Nemo Cosmo Pillowtop</a> - The Cosmo Pillowtop is <strong>designed as a coupler</strong> for the Nemo Cosmo sleeping pad, but it also <strong>adds 1 inch of foam padding</strong> to the top of the sleeping pad, and since 1 inch is thicker than many foam sleeping pads, it <strong>also makes a great double sleeping pad all by itself</strong>. And if you want to add more padding, you can always get your hands on a couple of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/cosmo-air-sleeping-pad\">Nemo Cosmo sleeping pads</a> to stuff inside. At <strong>4.6 pounds or 2.1 kilograms</strong>, however, it's certainly not a lightweight option for how much padding you get.</li>

You can either get a trekking pole that has a camera mount built in to the top of it, or else get a <strong>trekking pole camera mount</strong> that will work with a trekking pole that you already have. There are even a few trekking pole camera mounts that allow for easy self portraits, by holding the camera out, at the end of a trekking pole.
<h2>Trekking Pole Camera Mount</h2>
What to look for when you want a trekking pole camera mount.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Monopod</strong> – There are a few great trekking poles and trekking staffs out there that come with a camera mount built in to the top of them. This sort of set up gives you the same functionality that you would get from a traditional monopod, but you also get a trekking pole or trekking staff for walking.</li>
	<li><strong>Compatibility</strong> – If you are buying a camera mount for an existing trekking pole, you might have to have a certain trekking pole to get the mount to work. So before<!--more--> you buy a camera mount for an existing trekking pole, be sure that the camera mount will actually work with your trekking poles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Trekking Pole Camera Mount</h2>
Some of the very best trekking pole camera mounts, though there aren't that many to begin with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/745686/rei-hiker-shock-light-staff\">REI Hiker Shock Light Staff</a> - The REI Hiker is a <strong>hiking staff that comes with a camera mount built right in to the top of the staff</strong>, so that you have an easy to use monopod whenever you need one. And when you're not using the monopod you just screw the cork top on to the camera mount and you have a hiking staff. It's also <strong>anti-shock, and has three telescoping sections</strong> which gives you plenty of different length options. The whole thing weighs 8 ounces, or 226 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/767063/leki-sierra-antishock-sls-staff\">Leki Sierra Antishock SLS Staff</a> - The SLS Staff is <strong>another hiking staff</strong>, very similar in design to the REI option above. There's a <strong>solid wood knob at the top of the staff which will unscrew to reveal a camera mount</strong>. The staff itself is <strong>aluminum, and three sections</strong>, which gives you a staff that can be a length anywhere between 30.7 and 57 inches long. It also has an anti-shock system so your hiking isn't too jarring.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/aergon-photoadapter\">Leki Aergon Photoadapter</a> - This is actually a <strong>kit from Leki that will convert any of their Aergon trekking poles in to a trekking pole with a camera mount</strong> on the top of it. It comes with everything you need to remove the old grip and install the new one, including step by step instructions on the process.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://thestickpic.com/\">StickPic</a> - StickPic is something slightly different, it's <strong>a camera mount that sits on the end of your trekking pole</strong>, and then you hold the trekking pole out, away from you, to take a self portrait. It's ideal for when there's nowhere good that you can set your camera down to use the self timer feature.</li>

Mainly micro fleece jackets are used to keep you warm, but fleece has a few other properties, like the ability to naturally shed a bit of water, that makes it a useful fabric to use for gear that gets used in the outdoors a lot. Micro fleece being so thin, is particularly useful as a material for jackets that will be used for outdoor activities like hiking, backpacking or climbing, among many others.
<h2>Micro Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for from a micro fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Because micro fleece is the thinnest kind of fleece, it’s a good idea to get micro fleece jackets that have a hardened outer surface. This hardening helps make the jacket better able to withstand wind chill, which thin fleece jackets are otherwise not very good at doing.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – Another useful thing to get on a fleece jacket, regardless of the thickness, is a hood. Fleece jackets are generally meant to keep you warm, and your head loses quite a bit of heat. So if you want to stay warm, it’s a good idea to stick<!--more--> something on your head, and a hood is a convenient option for doing just that.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Micro Fleece Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best micro fleece jacket options, for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Micro Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-microchill-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Microchill Fleece Jacket</a> - The Microchill is a great, simple micro fleece jacket from Mountain Hardwear. No hood and no hardened outer surface, but a <strong>close fit which makes it perfect for layering</strong>, and a couple of good hand warmer pockets for when you need to get your extremities warm. A <strong>drawcord hem also helps keep the heat in</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808673/arcteryx-covert-cardigan-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Covert Cardigan Fleece Jacket</a> - Another relatively simple micro fleece jacket, this one from Arc'teryx. This has a <strong>looser fit</strong>, and while it would work on the trail, it's also the <strong>kind of fleece jacket that works well around town too</strong>. It comes with a couple zippered hand pockets for keeping your fingers warm, and a zippered pocket on the arm for storing a few essentials.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Micro Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-microchill-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Microchill Fleece Jacket</a> - A great micro fleece jacket for staying active in. It doesn't have a hood, and the outer surface isn't hard enough to keep out much wind, but it does have <strong>a close fit that will keep body warmth in, and will layer very well</strong>. It also has a couple of zippered hand warmer pockets, plus a drawcord hem to help hold warm air in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808464/arcteryx-covert-cardigan-fleece-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Covert Cardigan Fleece Jacket</a> - The Covert Cardigan is the kind of fleece that <strong>works as well on the trail as it does around town</strong>. It has a bit more of a relaxed fit, so it might not work quite as well as a layer, but it has a <strong>couple of hand warmer pockets, plus a zippered pocket on the left arm</strong> for carrying around a few essentials. So a great choice if you wan a micro fleece jacket that's a bit more casual.</li>

In terms of energy expenditure, every pound on your feet is equal to about five on your back. So lightweight hiking shoes really do make a difference. Just as a big, heavy backpack would have you gasping for air, big heavy hiking shoes will also have you gasping, while lightweight hiking shoes will leave you with plenty of energy.
<h2>Lightweight Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when what you want is lightweight hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Though it’s certainly possible to find a pair of lightweight waterproof hiking shoes, that waterproof liner is weight that you probably don’t need. In fact, if you want lightweight hiking shoes it’s better to go in the other direction, and get as many holes as you can in your shoes, so that they’re as breathable as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Proprioception</strong> – Many hiking shoes come with so much support and cushioning that if you couldn’t see what you were walking on you would never be able to tell. But that sensation of what’s under you, which is called <!--more-->proprioception, can actually improve the hiking experience, and getting rid of that excess material between you and the ground saves weight too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Hiking Shoes</h2>
Some of the very best lightweight hiking shoes for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805275/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-mens\">Vibram Five Fingers TrekSport</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804306/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - If you want lightweight, then <strong>Vibran's very unique toe shoes</strong> are a great choice. This particular version comes with a bit more grip on the bottom, to give you better traction on uneven, muddy or slippery trails. The top is also enclosed, so that you wont have dirt, sticks and rocks finding their way down in to the shoes. Of course as with all of the Vibram Five Fingers, the<strong> sole is rather thin</strong>, which cuts down on weight but also gives you a lot more proprioception with the ground. They <strong>weigh 12.4 ounces, or 351 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-x-talon-212-trail-running-shoe-mens\">Inov8 X-Talon 212</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-roclite-268-trail-running-shoe-womens\">Women's Roclite 268</a>) - The X-Talon 212s <strong>weigh just 212 grams, 7.5 ounces, as per their name</strong> (the similar women's shoe weighs 268 grams), making them the lightest hiking shoes by far on this list. They're made for trail running and long distance, cross country travel, where every single gram on your feet matters. The <strong>upper is thin mesh, to allow for plenty of air circulation, and bottom is sticky rubber</strong>, which provides excellent traction on bad trails. These are also fairly thin on the bottom, but do have some padding, to cushion your feet over the long miles. So an excellent pair of extremely lightweight hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-men-s-clearance\">Montrail Mountain Masochist</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-women-s-clearance\">Women's</a>) - Another pair of fairly simple hiking shoes that do a half decent job of being lightweight. The pair <strong>weighs 21.6 ounces, or 612 grams</strong>, so not as lightweight as the options above, but certainly not heavy either. They'e a <strong>basic mesh on top with a grippy sole on the bottom</strong>. They also offer a decent amount of padding, which is where a lot of that extra weight is located. So if you want a <strong>lightweight hiking shoe with a little more padding</strong>, these are an ideal choice.</li>

So it’s often a good idea to <strong>compare sleeping bags</strong>, as that’s often a good way to clearly illustrate the various strengths and weaknesses of sleeping bags. At the same time, it helps if you go in to that kind of comparison with at least a vague idea of what you want from a sleeping bag.
<h2>Compare Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look at when you want to compare sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation Material</strong> – One of the more obvious variables to consider when comparing sleeping bags is the material used for insulation. Briefly, synthetic insulation is heavier, but also cheaper and performs better when wet. Down, which is the other major choice, is more expensive, but also more compactable and lighter, relative to warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Another basic difference between many sleeping bags is the shape. A rectangular sleeping bag offers a little more room to spread out at night, but a mummy shaped<!--more--> bag is going to be smaller and lighter, and a much better choice for anyone looking to carry a sleeping bag in a backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the best sleeping bags across a range of options.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Highlite</a> - The Highlite is the perfect example of a <strong>lightweight and simple summer sleeping bag</strong>. With a <strong>minimum temperature of 35 degrees</strong> you might be able to use it in warmer spring and summer conditions, but summer will be the main season. And with features like <strong>850 fill down and a zipper that only goes half the length</strong> of the sleeping bag, a very low weight like <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong> is not that surprising, though it is impressive. So if you want something for backpacking in the warmer months of the year, this is an excellent choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralamina-32-sleeping-bag-synthetic\">Mountain Hardwear Ultralamina</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralamina-32-women-s-bag-synthetic\">Women's</a>) - The Ultralamina has a<strong> minimum temperature of 32 degrees</strong>, making it a solid choice for three season camping. It's also a good blend of weight saving features, like a mummy shape, as well as cost saving features like <strong>synthetic insulation</strong>. It also helps that it <strong>won the Gear of the Year award back in 2007 from Outside Magazine</strong>. So a solid choice if you want something that will perform well in a wide variety of settings, but don't want to spend the big money on a down sleeping bag. It weighs in at <strong>1 pound 16 ounces, or 898 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/830938/sea-to-summit-trek-tki-sleeping-bag\">Sea to Summit Trek Tk1</a> - The Tk1 is an interesting blend of features. It has a <strong>fairly rectangular shape</strong>, with a slight taper. And while it's a down sleeping bag, it uses <strong>lower quality 650 fill duck down, which helps to keep the price down</strong>. It has a <strong>32 degree temperature rating</strong>, making it another solid 3 season sleeping bag, and the weight, at <strong>1 pound 13 ounces, or 800 grams</strong> is certainly nothing to look down on. So if you want something a little more roomy, then the Tk1 from Sea to Summit is an ideal choice.</li>

Women’s and <strong>men’s hiking boots</strong> come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and there really is something for everyone. If you want big, heavy duty full grain leather hiking boots with a classic look then there is something for you. At the other end of the spectrum, there are some fantastic hiking boots that weigh as much, or less than many hiking shoes.
<h2>Men’s Hiking Boots</h2>
What to look for when reviewing men's hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Any good pair of hiking boots should have at least one way of keeping water out. The most popular is a waterproof liner, often made of Gore Tex. If you’re particularly worried about wet feet, full grain leather outers will also keep moisture out, provided that you properly maintain them.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – A heavy pair of hiking boots can tire your legs out quickly, while a smaller, lighter pair will leave you with more energy to finish out the day strong. Sometimes you need the extra durability and features that come on those<!--more--> heavier hiking boots, but if you can, a pair of lightweight hiking boots is usually a better choice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Hiking Boots</h2>
Of the many options, these are some of the best men's hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693828/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-mens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV</a> - If you want a <strong>big, serious hiking boot</strong>, then you wont find much better than the 520 GV boots. They're a <strong>full grain leather upper</strong>, which will withstand water and damage very well. That's <strong>complimented by a Gore Tex liner</strong>, which will keep out whatever water the leather uppers don't stop. Underneath that, a very <strong>solid and durable Vibram sole</strong> that will provide plenty of traction, and absorb the blows from any rocks or other uneven terrain underfoot. At <strong>3 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.73 kilograms</strong> they're certainly not light, but when you need something tough weight usually becomes secondary.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/zephyr-backpacking-boot-men-s\">Kayland Zephyr</a> - The Zephyr boots, on the other hand, take weight very seriously. In fact at <strong>19.4 ounces, or 550 grams they're lighter than most shoes</strong>, let alone boots. They <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and despite being so lightweight, they're actually <strong>waterproof thanks to an eVent liner</strong>. That, combined with a lightweight and minimal Vibram sole makes these an excellent choices for hikers who don't want to walk around with weights on their feet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/salomon-3d-fastpacker-shoe-mens\">Salomon 3D Fastpacker</a> - These are another relatively lightweight pair of hiking boots for men, at <strong>31 ounces, or 878 grams</strong>. They're a <strong>lower cut</strong>, so you don't get much in the way of ankle support, and they're<strong> also not waterproof</strong>. Not being waterproof, however, means they're more breathable, and so if you don't plan on getting wet, and don't want sweaty feet, these are a great option for a men's hiking boot.</li>

Which is certainly not to say that waterproof gaiters wont breath, because they will, it’s just that gaiters that are only water resistant, or not waterproof at all will breath a lot more. And <strong>breathable gaiters</strong> are a great piece of gear to have in the summer time, when you’re less worried about rain and moisture and more worried about debris in your boots or shoes.
<h2>Breathable Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when shopping for breathable gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Waterproof gaiters are probably not a good idea if you’re looking for breathable, but there’s nothing wrong with getting a pair of water resistant gaiters. Water resistant gaiters will breath relatively well, and if you ever find yourself needing something to keep a bit of water out, they will do that too.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle</strong> – If you’re looking to keep debris out of your shoes then you would likely be fine with just a pair of ankle gaiters. The taller, calf length gaiters are useful, but<!--more--> they trap more of your leg under the gaiter, and for just keeping debris out you don’t really need all that extra fabric protecting your leg.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Breathable Gaiters</h2>
Some of the best choices for breathable gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - If you want a <strong>full length, waterproof gaiter</strong> that is also going to breath well, then you want an eVent gaiter. <strong>eVent is a fabric similar to Gore Tex, but is generally more breathable</strong>. The Rab Hispars are made with 3 layer eVent on the top section, to keep water out, and then <strong>600D ballistic polyester on the bottom</strong>, to stand up to a little use and abuse. So a really excellent of waterproof yet breathable gaiters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-low-gaiter\">Outdoor Research Rocky Mountain Low Gaiters</a> - The Rocky Mountain gaiters are, as the name suggests, a pair of <strong>ankle gaiters</strong>. They're made with nylon, which is definitely a very breathable fabric, and an ideal choice for gaiters. They also come with a <strong>water resistant coating</strong>, which doesn't do much to detract from the breathability, but will definitely help to keep some rain and snow out. So an <strong>ideal compromise between keeping some amount of water out and breathing very well</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803452/rei-desert-gaiters\">REI Desert Gaiters</a> - The REI Desert Gaiters are <strong>built primarily to keep debris like dirt and rocks out of your shoes</strong>. They're nylon, so they will keep some amount of water out, and will also dry very quickly if they get wet, but the main thing that these gaiters are meant to keep out of your shoes is not water. But that said, they are <strong>extremely breathable</strong>, and actually have a <strong>UPF 30 rating</strong>, to keep the sun off and your feet dry from sweat.</li>

They’re a great portable option when you need some stability for your camera shots but you also need to keep moving. And if you are a hiker, backpacker or camper it’s easy to see how a monopod could do double duty as a trekking pole as well. And in fact a <strong>trekking pole monopod</strong> combination is not that difficult to find,.
<h2>Trekking Pole Monopod</h2>
What to look for when you want a trekking pole monopod.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Threads</strong> – Different monopods may have different threads or systems for attaching a camera. Just be sure, before you buy, that the trekking pole monopod you are looking at has an attachment system that is compatible with your camera, otherwise all you will have is a fancy and expensive trekking pole.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – You are going to be using your monopod to take photos, but you are also going to be using it as a trekking pole, and a heavy trekking pole is not much fun to have to<!--more--> lug around. Which is why it’s a good idea to look closely at the weight of your trekking pole monopod, and compare weights with others.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/767063/leki-sierra-antishock-sls-staff\">Leki Sierra Antishock SLS Staff</a> - First up, a great trekking pole monopod from Leki. It looks, to all appearances, like your average hiking staff, but <strong>screwing off the wooden top knob reveals a camera mount</strong> that allows you to use the trekking pole just like a monopod. Beyond that it's a <strong>three section pole that will telescope to a wide range of heights</strong>, and has some anti-shock built in too, as the name suggests.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/728693/brunton-monopod\">Brunton Monopod</a> - This offering from Brunton looks less like a trekking pole and more like a monopod, though it's perfectly suited to either. It <strong>uses standard 1/4 20 threads for the camera mount, and will telescope between 25.5 inches and 62.5 inches</strong> in length, so suitable for pretty much any height.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/komperdell-guide-titanal-trekking-pole-1-pole\">Komperdell Guide Titanal Trekking Pole</a> - The Titanal is <strong>just about indistinguishable from your average trekking pole</strong>. But <strong>by detaching the foam grip a universal camera mount is revealed</strong> that will instantly turn the trekking pole in to a monopod, ideal for stabilizing a camera shot. But it also functions extremely well as a trekking pole, with <strong>high density aluminum for the shaft and a tungsten and carbide tip</strong> for maximum durability.</li>

Of course if you want to carry a lightweight sleeping bag but also get a good night of sleep, you need to know what to look for.
<h2>Lightweight Sleeping Bags for Backpacking</h2>
What to look for when you want to be looking at lightweight sleeping bags for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> – Generally, down is a lighter insulator than synthetic, relative to the amount of heat provided. So if you want a lightweight sleeping bag, you want a down sleeping bag. Even more than that, you want a down sleeping bag that has a high quality down, because it takes less 900+ fill down, for instance, to provide the same amount of warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Mummy</strong> – It should go without saying, but you also want a mummy shaped sleeping bag if you are looking to save on weight. Rectangular or even semi-rectangular sleeping bags have a lot of wasted space, and by eliminating that excess space you stay warmer and also<!--more--> help lower the weight of the sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Sleeping Bags for Backpacking</h2>
Some of the very best lightweight sleeping bags to take backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - The HighLite is the ideal lightweight sleeping bag for summer camping. It has a <strong>temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>, which is just right for the summer nights in many parts of the world.

Features like just a half length zipper, large box baffles, a mummy shape and <strong>850 fill down</strong> are what help this impressive sleeping bag achieve such a light weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong> this is only slightly warmer than the HighLite above, but might be better suited to three season backpacking, and not just summer backpacking, in many parts of the world. What's impressive about the Laser 600 is that it uses <strong>900 fill down</strong>, which is the highest quality that you will find just about anywhere. And at <strong>1 pound 6.2 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>, it's a fantastically lightweight sleeping bag option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808964/marmot-plasma-15-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma 15</a> - If you need something better suited to four season backpacking, or just three season backpacking in colder climates, the Plasma 15 is ideal.

So if you are looking for a larger <strong>5 man tent</strong> to save weight, you might be better off with a 2 man tent and a 3 man tent, or some other combination of tents. But if you’re just looking to fit everyone under one roof, then a 5 man tent is an ideal way to go. But with such a large tent, there are definitely a few unique things that you need to be on the lookout for.
<h2>5 Man Tent</h2>
What to look for when buying a 5 man tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As alluded to above, the weight of a 5 man tent is going to be fairly high. So if you are planning on carrying your 5 man tent for any significant amount of time, you will want to look carefully at the weight of various 5 man tents, and try and find one that is relatively lightweight, so that you don’t end up carrying too much weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Doors and Separators</strong> – 5 people sleeping in close proximity can lead to a lot of interrupted sleep. For that reason, it’s helpful to have a separator that will split the tent up in to two halves, to count down on noise. Similarly, it’s helpful to have<!--more--> 2 doors, so that people don’t have to crawl all over each other to reach the single door.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 5 Man Tent</h2>
Some of your best choices for a 5 man tent.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810022/marmot-limestone-4p-tent\">Marmot Limestone</a> - Though <strong>technically a 4 man tent, the Limetone has enough floor space, at 60 square feet, for 5 people</strong> to squeeze in. And at <strong>10 pounds 15 ounces, or 4.96 kilograms</strong> it's a relatively lightweight option that would suit a lot of backpackers and campers doing something more than car camping. There's just one door, unfortunately, but still a good option for a 5 man tent that is on the lightweight side.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/backcountry-barn-tent-5-person-3-season\">MSR Backcountry Barn</a> - The Backcountry Barn is designed just like it's named, in the shape of a barn. With a <strong>1.9 meter ceiling and a removable floor, plus a big huge front door</strong>, the Backcountry Barn will work as a tent or as a meeting place, somewhere to eat or just about anything else. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, but not all that lightweight, at <strong>14 pounds 11 ounces, or 6.65 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-dome-5-tent-5-person-4-season\">The North Face Dome</a> - The Dome is a <strong>true four season tent</strong> from The North Face. It's a big geodesic dome, with an <strong>impressive 10 poles</strong> to provide plenty of strength. There's also <strong>2 doors, and a big huge vestibule</strong> for storing gear. It's a <strong>single wall design, but at 31 pounds 7 ounces, or 14.25 kilograms</strong> it's best used as a base camp tent.</li>

The <strong>best sleeping pad for backpacking</strong>, then, is a sleeping pad that will keep you comfortable at night, and not keep you awake and staring at the tent walls. A backpacking sleeping pad is also best when it is lightweight, and not adding too much weight to your backpack.
<h2>Best Sleeping Pad for Backpacking</h2>
What to look for when you want the best sleeping pad for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As any experience backpacker is no doubt well aware, lightweight gear is better than heavy gear. And sleeping pad weights can vary considerably, based on a few different variables. A mummy shaped sleeping pad, for instance, will tend to be lighter than a rectangular shaped sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Kind</strong> – There are inflatable sleeping pads and then there are foam sleeping pads. Foam sleeping pads<!--more--> tend to be lightweight, but also not quite as well padded, and bulky too. Inflatable sleeping pads come in a wide variety of weights, but generally offer a more comfortable sleeping surface to get you through the night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Pad for Backpacking Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the very best sleeping pads to take backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is an <strong>extremely popular inflatable sleeping pad</strong>, and for a good reason. At just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong> it's an extremely lightweight rectangular sleeping pad. It's also <strong>2.5 inches thick, with an R-value of 2.5</strong>, making it a rather comfortable three season sleeping pad. It also <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so a seriously good sleeping pad to take backpacking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - Another inflatable sleeping pad, this one <strong>focused more on value oriented customers</strong> looking for a good deal. It comes in <strong>a couple of different shapes, including a mummy shape that weighs in at 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>. It has an R-value of just 1, so it's not particularly warm, but it's 2.5 inches thick when inflated, so it's plenty comfortable. But what really stands out about this sleeping pad is the low price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z Lite</a> - The Z Lite is a great example of a <strong>foam sleeping pad</strong>. It has a <strong>egg carton design on top</strong> to maximize comfort while minimizing weight. It also folds up nicely in the morning, so that packing it isn't too much of a struggle. Of course with a foam sleeping pad you don't have to worry about things like punctures, which is always nice. The <strong>regular size weighs 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, just like the other two sleeping pads above, and has an <strong>R-value of 2.2, and is .75 inches thick</strong>.</li>

But there are other options available, one of the better ones being a hammock. The <strong>best camping hammock</strong> will be able to keep you comfortable in a wide variety of conditions, just like a tent would. The only caveat that you have to remember with a hammock is that you need somewhere to actually hang the hammock, or else you will be sleeping on the ground.
<h2>Best Camping Hammock</h2>
What to look for when shopping for the very best camping hammock.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bug Proof</strong> – If you’re camping where bugs aren’t a problem then there’s no need to bother with a bug net. But if you’re not lucky enough to be sleeping bug free, you need a bug proof hammock. Ideally, you want one that has a bug net built in, so that you can be sure there are no places for bugs to get in.</li>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – Hammocks often come just with the hammock, but there are a few other things you will need to get a hammock working properly. A hanging system, for one, to attach<!--more--> your hammock to trees. You are also likely to want a tarp to drape over you, unless you can be sure it will be dry all night long, and you wont get wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Hammock Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a few of the very best camping hammocks.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hammock-bliss-no-see-um-no-more-hammock\">Hammock Bliss No-See-Um More</a> - This hammock <strong>includes just about everything you need to be comfortable in the outdoors, minus a tarp</strong> for hanging over the hammock to keep the rain off. So you get a hammock, plus 100 feet of line for hanging. The hammock itself also <strong>has a built in no-see-um net</strong>, as the name suggests, so you wont be bothered by bugs. It also has a slightly larger <strong>maximum weight of 350 pounds</strong>, so a good choice for those who need the extra capacity. It <strong>weighs 28 ounces, or 793 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/skeeter-beeter-ul-hammock\">Grand Trunk Skeeter Beeter UL Hammock</a> - The Skeeter Beeter is another hammock that <strong>comes with just about everything you need, minus a tarp for the top of the hammock</strong>, to keep any rain or showers at night off. But what it does have is a suspension system, so that you can hang the hammock right away. The hammock also has <strong>a no-see-um net built in</strong> to keep mosquitoes off, as the name suggests. It will only <strong>hold 250 pounds</strong>, which is less than the Hammock Bliss option above, but it also weighs less, at just <strong>20 ounces, which is 567 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight Asym</a> - This hammock from Hennessy is <strong>everything you need to go camping with a hammock, including the crucial tarp</strong> that you'll need when the rain starts falling.

It has a <strong>maximum weight of 250 pounds</strong>, and a weight of <strong>2 pound 7 ounces, which is 1.1 kilograms</strong>.</li>

There are even several different kinds of metals, each with their own positives and negatives. The main advantage of <strong>stainless steel camping plates</strong> is that they are strong and durable. Stainless steel is the ideal material to use if you’re hard on your camping gear. It cant compare to aluminum or titanium in terms of weight, but it’s stronger than aluminum, and cheaper than titanium.
<h2>Stainless Steel Camping Plates</h2>
What to look at when reviewing stainless steel camping plates.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Diameter</strong> – The bigger the plate, the more you will be able to fit on it. So if you like to eat big meals while you’re out camping, a bigger camping plate will be a better choice. Of course the design and size of your stainless steel camping plate will depend, in part, on what kinds of foods you like to eat.</li>
	<li><strong>Sides</strong> – Many camping plates are not so much plates as a combination of plate and bowl. They have a wide, flat bottom like a plate, and then high sides, similar to a bowl. This allows you<!--more--> to get a lot of messy food on your plate, without having any of it end up on the ground or in your lap. It even allows you to eat things like soup without needing a separate bowl.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Stainless Steel Camping Plates</h2>
There aren't many out there, but these are the best stainless steel camping plates.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-alpine-plate-cas0047\">MSR Alpine Plate</a> - If you just want a standard stainless steel plate to take camping, this is it. It's an ideal size, at <strong>7.5 inches in diameter</strong>, and nice <strong>raised sides</strong> that will keep anything that's a little more sloppy on your plate. It will also nest well with MSR's 2 liter or 3 liter pots, which is always a good thing to be able to do. It <strong>weighs 4.4 ounces, or 126 grams</strong>, but you cant expect extremely lightweight equipment when choosing stainless steel.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401033/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-soup-plate\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Plate</a> - This is actually a <strong>stainless steel plate core that's coated in enamel</strong>. Enamel is a classic material when it comes to backpacking and camping, and with this plate, you get the durability of enamelware, and the strength of stainless steel, making it an ideal combination. It <strong>has raised sides</strong>, to keep your food on your plate on uneven eating surfaces, but at <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong> it's definitely not something that you would want to be carrying.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-plate\">Snow Peak Titanium Plate</a> - One of the more common reasons that people choose stainless steel over titanium is that titanium is more expensive. But when it's just a flat piece of metal the price difference isn't that great, and the advantages of titanium are significant. This particular <strong>titanium plate has raised sides and a 7.5 inch diameter</strong>, which is fairly standard. But where it stands out is a weight of just <strong>2 ounces, or 56 grams</strong>, which is quite a bit less than either of the stainless steel camping plate options listed above.</li>

In an emergency situation, and especially an overnight one, it is often going to be essential to get out of the weather and in to something warm, so that you don’t get too exposed to the elements. But at the same, you don’t want to be carrying a big, heavy sleeping bag, just in case of an emergency.
<h2>Emergency Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look at when you want an emergency sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Warmth</strong> – In an emergency situation you’re not likely to be crawling out of your clothes and in to a sleeping bag. Rather, you’re going to be jumping in with everything on, for maximum warmth, so it’s not essential that your sleeping bag be warm enough to be cozy and comfortable, but rather just warm enough so that you’re not in danger.</li>
	<li><strong>Size and Weight</strong> – A piece of emergency gear, by definition, is not something that you are using on a regular basis. It’s the piece of gear that you throw in the bottom <!--more-->of your backpack and forget about, until you need it. So any good emergency sleeping bag is going to be small and lightweight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Emergency Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the very best emergency sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813512/sol-emergency-blanket\">SOL Emergency Blanket</a> - This is, as the name suggests, just <strong>an emergency blanket</strong>, so not really a sleeping bag. It measures <strong>84 inches by 56 inches</strong>, so it's quite big, and will <strong>shelter you from the wind and the rain</strong>, as well as <strong>reflect approximately 90% of your body heat</strong> back at you. It's also reusable, which is nice, and at just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong> you'll hardly even know you're carrying it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/space-metallized-emergency-bag\">Liberty Mountain Space Metallized Emergency Bag</a> - This is the same material that <strong>reflects about 90% of your body heat</strong> back at you, but shaped like a sleeping bag, so that you can crawl right in. It's not quite as durable as the SOL blanket above, but it will <strong>keep you out of the wind and the rain</strong>, and at just <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong> it's light enough to throw in your backpack and forget about until you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite Sleeping Bag</a> - If you'd prefer a real sleeping bag to take along, the HighLite makes an ideal choice for emergency situations. At just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong> it's extremely lightweight. It uses <strong>high quality 850 fill down</strong> and a <strong>half length zipper</strong>, among a few other things, to get that low weight. It's also mummy shaped, and down <strong>is very compactable</strong>, so it will take up a minimal amount of room in your backpack. It only has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>, but in an emergency you just need to be warm enough to not be in danger.</li>

And if you have a <strong>3 person tent</strong>, you can cut down on the weight that would come from having to haul around multiple tents. But not every 3 person tent is created equal, and before you buy it will help to do a little research and figure out where your priorities lay, and what you need to be looking for when shopping for your next 3 person tent.
<h2>3 Person Tent</h2>
What to look at when you're looking at a 3 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Floor Space</strong> - Not every 3 person tent is created equal. Two tents may each say they can fit three people inside, but may feel a bit more cramped when you actually get inside them. It's much better to compare floor space, so that you have a good idea of exactly how large your 3 person tent is going to be.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> - As alluded to above, a 3 person tent is a good way to save on weight. But even so, there are vast differences in the weights of various 3 person tents, and one tent will weigh quite a bit<!--more--> more than another. Some of this comes down to four season tents versus three season tents, but it will pay to take a close look at the weight of any potential tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 3 Person Tent</h2>
Some of the best options for a 3 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL3</a> - If you need a straight <strong>3 man dome tent</strong>, the Fly Creek is an excellent choice. At <strong>3.18 pounds, which is 1.45 kilograms</strong> it's definitely one of the lighter 3 person tents on the market, and a solid choice if you want to save on weight. In fact, the <strong>2 person version of this tent won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, in part because of it's excellent, lightweight design. It also gives you <strong>39 square feet of floor space</strong> to work with, which isn't spacious, but is certainly enough for 3 people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-rock-32-bx-tent-3-person-3-season\">The North Face Rock 32 Bx</a> - The Rock 32 is a good choice if all you want to do is some recreational camping. It has a <strong>low price, and a fairly basic dome tent design. At 5 pounds 13 ounces, which is 2.63 kilograms</strong> it's not going to win any awards for low weight, but with <strong>43.3 square feet of internal space</strong>, plus the low price, it's an excellent choice for casual campers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/rainshadow2.html\">TarpTent Rainshadow 2</a> - The Rainshadow is an excellent combination of low price and lightweight design. At <strong>42 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms it's the lightest 3 person tent</strong> on this list. And with <strong>42 square feet of floor space</strong>, it's also one of the roomier tent 3 person tents out there. What makes it such a lightweight option is that it's actually a <strong>single wall design</strong>, though it does have plenty of ventilation to avoid a build up of condensation. It also gives you <strong>the option to use trekking poles instead of tent poles</strong>, though you can also purchase optional tent poles. Best of all, the price is very reasonable. So a good all around combination of value and features.</li>

If you use a wood stove, for instance, then you might go camping somewhere that has a ban on wood fires, or where you just cant find any wood. Or you might find it difficult to get a certain kind of fuel for your liquid fuel stove, and end up needing to make do with another kind. Whatever the case, <strong>multi fuel camping stoves</strong> are the answer.
<h2>Multi Fuel Camping Stoves</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing multi fuel camping stoves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuels</strong> – Whatever fuels that your stove is able to use, you should make sure that you will be able to utilize the alternative fuels. If you don’t have easy access to the alternative fuels, for instance, then having the ability to use those alternative fuels isn’t going to be of much use to you.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Camping stoves can get heavy quickly, but there is no reason to haul around a heavy camping stove when there is a lighter option available. Many stoves are actually <!--more-->lighter than the fuel that they use, making them an excellent option for anyone who is concerned about having to haul around a lot of excess weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Multi Fuel Camping Stoves</h2>
Some of your best choices for a multi fuel camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/830342/msr-whisperlite-universal-backpacking-stove\">MSR WhisperLite Universal Backpacking Stove</a> - The WhisperLite is a true multi-fuel stove. It <strong>will run on white gas, kerosene and even gasoline, but will also run on propane, or canisters</strong>, and even includes a handy little piece for inverting the canister for maximum performance, particularly in cold climates. So if you want maximum versatility, this is it. It will <strong>boil water in about 3.5 minutes for liquid fuels, and 3.75 minutes for propane. It weighs 11.5 ounces, or 326 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/multi-fuel-ex-stove-w-windscreen\">Primus Multi-Fuel EX Stove</a> - This is another multiple fuel stove, though it sticks to just multiple liquid fuels, and not canisters, or propane. It does, however, burn <strong>quite a few different liquid fuels, including white gas, gasoline, diesel, kerosene and even aviation fuel</strong> if that's what you have. It also <strong>comes with a wind screen</strong>, which is a nice feature, and will boil water in about 3 minutes. The whole thing <strong>weighs 15.4 ounces, or 436 grams</strong> with the fuel pump.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove</a> - The DX stove will burn multiple fuels, but those <strong>fuels are alcohol, wood and whatever other solid fuels you can get your hands on</strong>. Since you don't have to worry about fuel bottles and the like this is a far less complex stove. The whole thing is also <strong>made from titanium, so it weighs a very reasonable 3 ounces, or 86 grams</strong>, which is considerably less than either of the stoves above, which makes it an excellent option for anyone looking for a lightweight multi fuel camping stove.</li>

But at the same time you have to be able to at least sleep at night, or else you’re not going to enjoy yourself while out there backpacking. So you need a compromise, and an <strong>ultralight backpacking pillow</strong> is an excellent compromise. Fortunately, there are more than a couple really great options for those that want a pillow, but don’t want to have to carry a lot of weight.
<h2>Ultralight Backpacking Pillow</h2>
What to look at when shopping for an ultralight backpacking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bulk</strong> – Weight is one thing, but you also have to worry about bulk when it comes to backpacking pillows. A foam pillow might not weigh very much, after all, but it will take up quite a bit of room, and will not be a fun piece of gear to have to pack every morning when you’re out there on the trail.</li>
	<li><strong>Inflatable</strong> – Foam pillows are definitely an option, but if you’re looking for an ultralight backpacking pillow your best choice is likely<!--more--> an inflatable option. They tend to weigh less and also pack down a lot smaller. A light pillow is important, but as alluded to above, so is a small pillow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Backpacking Pillow</h2>
Some of the best choices for an ultralight backpacking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - If you want an ultralight backpacking pillow, this is it. It's a <strong>basic, rectangular inflatable pillow</strong> that weighs an impressive <strong>2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>, which is about as lightweight a backpacking pillow as you are going to find anywhere. But it's more than big enough for your head, and surprisingly comfortable, especially with a sweater or something similar draped over top. And being inflatable, it packs down extremely small, which backpackers will appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-cloudrest-down-pillow\">Western Mountaineering Cloudrest Down Pillow</a> - Down pillows get a lot of hate, but if you use them correctly they can be a very useful piece of backpacking gear. By themselves they wont provide much comfort because the down compresses down quite a bit. But <strong>placed on top of a few bulky items, a down pillow provides that layer of comfort that you need for a comfortable sleep</strong>. And being down, your head will also stay nice and warm at night. Down also <strong>packs down extremely small</strong>, of course, so it's easy to pack in the morning, and it weighs just <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>, which is hard to argue with.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719843/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - If you have your heart set on a <strong>traditional foam pillow</strong> then this option from Therm-A-Rest is very popular, if more heavy than the other two options above. It comes in <strong>three different sizes, the medium weighing 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>. What's good about this pillow is that it has something like a <strong>compression sack built in to the pillowcase</strong>, so that you can at least get the whole thing compressed down in to a smaller package when it comes time to pack up in the morning. So not quite as ultralight as some of the other options, but about as good as you're likely to do for a foam pillow.</li>

A <strong>camping coffee filter</strong> is just one of several different options for making that coffee. But it is definitely one of the better options, as it’s lightweight and small enough that it wont weigh much, and wont end up taking up much room in your backpack, which is always best when it comes to camping or backpacking equipment.
<h2>Camping Coffee Filter</h2>
What to look for from a camping coffee filter.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Design</strong> – There are actually a few different filter options when it comes to camping coffee filters. There is a drip filter option, which most people are familiar with. But there is also the immersion filter option, which works in the same way that a tea immersion filter does, and can actually double as a tea filter in a pinch.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As with any piece of camping equipment that you’re going to have to carry, you want your camping coffee filter to be small and lightweight, so that it’s not like adding rocks to your backpack. Fortunately for you, most<!--more--> filters are fairly small and lightweight to begin with, so it’s a good option for saving weight and bulk.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Filter</h2>
There aren't too many to choose from, but these are the best camping coffee filters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-java-drip\">GSI Ultralight Java Drip</a> - The Java Drip is <strong>reminiscent of the drip filter that you use at home</strong>, though with some differences. It has a couple of plastic legs that slot on to the edges of your cup or mug, and then the filter portion is suspended above, so you can leave it to drip away while you attend to breaking down camp or making breakfast. But what really stands out here is that the whole thing <strong>weighs just .6 ounces, or 17 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-mugmate-coffee-tea-reusable-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee Filter</a> - The MugMat is more of a traditional <strong>immersion filter</strong> that loose leaf tea drinkers are likely familiar with. You load the coffee in to the filter and let it sit in your hot water. The <strong>longer you leave it in, the stronger your coffee is</strong>. It's entirely reusable, of course, works with a wide variety of cups and mugs and <strong>weighs just 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>. It also <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/750397/gsi-outdoors-h2jo-coffee-filter\">GSI Outdoors H2jO! Coffee Filter</a> - This filter is similar to the MugMate above, but is <strong>designed to screw on to the top of a bottle,</strong> like a lid would. You can then close the lid and let the immersed coffee grounds do the work of making coffee. The drawback, of course, is that it <strong>only works with some bottles, or more specifically wide mouth bottles, like the wide mouth Nalgene bottles</strong>. So a good camping coffee filter, as long as you have a bottle that it will work with. It <strong>weighs a total of 1.8 ounces, or 51 grams</strong>.</li>

You should know, however, that unlike a two person tent, a 2 person sleeping bag is not a good way to save on weight. If your thought is to save weight, you’re really better off with two lightweight, 1 person sleeping bags. But if you just want to get cozy, a double wide sleeping bag is perfect.
<h2>Double Wide Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you want a double wide sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Divider</strong> – Many double sleeping bags come with a divider down the middle, so that while the sleeping bag is one large unit, each person’s sleeping space is separated. It’s an option to at least be aware of when you’re shopping for a sleeping bag that you can share.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – Regardless of the size of your sleeping bag, you still need to pick an insulating material. Down is definitely the higher quality choice, but synthetic insulation has a<!--more--> couple things going for it, including the generally lower price and the fact that it performs much better than down when wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Double Wide Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the best choices for a double wide sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778962/the-north-face-twin-peaks-20-sleeping-bag-double-wide-long\">The North Face Twin Peaks</a> - This is one of the few double sleeping bags out there with <strong>a taper</strong>, which does a few things. First, it helps to eliminate dead space within the sleeping bag, and second it cuts down on the weight. But since the <strong>synthetic insulation adds a bit of weight</strong>, as compared to down, and the whole thing comes out with a weight of <strong>5 pounds 13 ounces, which is 2.64 kilograms</strong>. It has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 20 degrees</strong>, so good for colder weather, and being synthetic insulation, the price stays down.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/king-solomon-15-double-bag-650-down\">Big Agnes King Solomon</a> - One of the few down double sleeping bags you will see, though it's only <strong>filled with 600 fill down</strong>, which is not especially high quality. But this does help keep the price down, and the weight too, at <strong>5 pounds pounds 3 ounces, or 2.35 kilograms</strong>. It also has a solid <strong>minimum temperature of 15 degrees</strong>, so both warmer and lighter than the Twin Peaks from North Face above. It also has a <strong>hood for both sleepers</strong>, which is a nice touch, and zippers on either side.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-dream-island-sleeping-bag-15-degree-synthetic\">Big Agnes Dream Island</a> - Another sleeping bag with a <strong>minimum temperature of 15 degrees</strong>, though this one is <strong>filled with synthetic insulation</strong>, and while this makes it cheaper, it also makes it quite a bit heavier, at <strong>9 pounds 5 ounces, which is 4.22 kilograms</strong>. That's almost three times the weight of the King Solomon above, another double wide sleeping bag with a 15 degree minimum temperature. It <strong>does also come with a hood</strong>, which is nice when it's cold out. So definitely a car camping sleeping bag, whereas the King Solomon above would be a better sleeping bag to carry.</li>

It can really pay off, then, to a find <strong>cheap camping backpacks</strong>. Sales are the obvious way to find a good deal, but when sales don’t get the job done, it helps to know a little bit about backpacks. If you know what to look for, you can find the cheap camping backpacks that wont break after the first camping trip.
<h2>Cheap Camping Backpacks</h2>
What to look for when you want cheap camping backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Features</strong> – Before you go shopping, identify what features you need from a backpack, and what features you don’t. Things like sleeping bag compartments and removable lids that convert in to day packs are nice to have, but hardly necessary. If you don’t need these features, don’t pay for them, by finding a backpack that lacks them.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – You might think that a cheaper backpack would be lighter, but actually, a lower weight often requires superior fabric and construction<!--more--> techniques, and so you might end up having to get a heavier backpack. Your legs and back wont thank you, but your wallet will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Camping Backpacks</h2>
Some of the best camping backpacks with a low price tag.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam Backpack</a> - The Jam is <strong>small, lightweight and ideal for a weekend backpacker</strong>, or a lightweight backpacker without much gear to carry. It <strong>doesn't have any real frame</strong>, so you wont to be carrying any more than 25 to 30 pounds, but with just <strong>50 liters of capacity</strong> for the large, you're not going to be able to fit a huge amount of gear in anyway. And at just <strong>31 ounces, or 879 grams</strong> for the large, the Jam certainly wont be adding much weight to your overall load.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795972/the-north-face-terra-65-pack\">The North Face Terra 65</a> - A <strong>cheap and basic multi day backpack</strong> that is low in price because it's simple, not because it's poorly made. It has a decent suspension system, a frame and a few external pockets for storing smaller essentials in easy to reach areas. It also has a sleeping bag compartment and a few well placed suspension straps. You get <strong>65 liters of storage capacity</strong>, which is enough for most people. The main criticism you can make of this backpack is that at <strong>5 pounds 1 ounce, or 2.34 kilograms</strong> for the large it's rather heavy. So if you're concerned about weight this might not be the backpack for you, but you really cant argue with the low price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - ULA Equipment is a smaller, lightweight backpacking manufacturer that many people probably haven't heard of, but they make some excellent products, such as the Circuit. It has a total of<strong> 68 liters of storage</strong> to work with, making it a nice and roomy backpack for most purposes. And at just <strong>36 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong> it's just slightly heavier than the much smaller GoLite Jam above. It has a <strong>very basic aluminum frame</strong>, plus a number of features like a bladder sleeve, hip belt pockets and external webbing and water bottle pockets that backpackers will definitely appreciate. It's the most expensive backpack on the list, but also has the best weight to capacity ratio, so a good choice for those looking to save a few ounces.</li>

But a 2 person sleeping pad, unlike a 2 person tent, is not a good way to save weight with your camping or backpacking gear. There aren’t many 2 person sleeping pads out there, and you’re better off with two lightweight, single person sleeping pads if you want to save weight.
<h2>2 Person Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look at when you want a 2 person sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foam or Inflatable</strong> – With 2 people on an inflatable sleeping pad there is a much greater risk that one person shifting around will disturb the sleep of the other person. So while an 2 person inflatable sleeping pad is certainly an option, you might find yourself getting a better sleep with a 2 person foam sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – Regardless of the size of your sleeping pad, you need to decide on what season you’re going to be using it in. For winter camping, you want a sleeping pad with a high R-value, R-value being a measurement of how<!--more--> much heat your sleeping pad will reflect. In summer, it’s not nearly as important to have a warm sleeping pad.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-down-coupler\">Therm-A-Rest Down Coupler</a> - This is actually a coupler, as the name suggests, which means it's typically <strong>used to join two sleeping pads together</strong>, rather than work, by itself, as a sleeping pad. It is, however, <strong>filled with 650 fill down</strong>, which wont provide much in the way of padding, unfortunately, but does add quite a bit of warmth, making it a great option for joining two sleeping pads in winter conditions. The large <strong>weighs 1 pound 7 ounces, which is 652 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/748726/exped-multimat-sleeping-mat\">Exped MultiMat</a> - The MultiMat is, as the name suggests, a mat that can be used for a wide variety of different things, including sleeping on. But at<strong> just 2 millimeters thin</strong>, it would make for a rather uncomfortable sleeping surface, unless you enjoy a hard sleeping surface. That said, if you can make it work as a sleeping pad for you, it weighs <strong>just 12 ounces, which is 340 grams</strong>, and a very reasonable weight for a 2 person sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/cosmo-pillowtop-1-2-person\">Nemo Cosmo Pillowtop</a> - The Pillowtop from Cosmo is <strong>another coupler, though it's a foam padded coupler</strong>, and at <strong>1 inch thick is actually thicker than many 1 person foam sleeping pads</strong> all by itself. So if you wanted to use it as a straight sleeping pad you would be more than comfortable, and of course you could always get your hands on a couple of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/cosmo-air-sleeping-pad\">Nemo Cosmo sleeping pads</a> to couple together, which would add even more comfort to your sleeping experience. It weighs <strong>4.6 pounds, which is 2.1 kilograms</strong>.</li>

Of course there are plenty to choose from, and the <strong>best knife for backpacking</strong> will depend on what you plan to use your knife for. If you just want something sharp, for those just in case you end up needing it, then there are some lightweight options that you wont even know you’re carrying, whereas a knife that’s going to see heavy use should be a little bigger and tougher, to survive the backpacking trip.
<h2>Best Knife for Backpacking</h2>
What to consider when you want the best knife for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As alluded to above, the weight of your backpacking knife matters, in part because you’re going to have to carry that knife around everywhere with you. If you want a really lightweight knife you’re better off with a folding knife, though fixed blade knives have the advantage of being a fair bit stronger.</li>
	<li><strong>Serrated</strong> – For backpacking it helps to have versatile equipment, because you may run in to all kinds of different situations that you need to be prepared for. If you end up needing to cut rope <!--more-->or cord, for instance, a serrated section on your knife will come in handy, just as a smooth section will come in handy for other stuff.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Knife for Backpacking Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a select few of the best knives for backpacking with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Gerber Big Rock</a> - The Big Rock is a good, solid <strong>fixed blade knife</strong>. At <strong>6.3 ounces or 178 grams</strong> it's not especially lightweight, but then most fixed blade knives aren't. What it does have is a <strong>4.5 inch blade</strong>, a good portion of which is serrated, so that you have the option to saw through whatever you need cut. It has a lanyard hole at the end of the handle for attaching something, and a good grip, but is just a basic, solid fixed blade knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/34-gram-pocket-knife-black-titanium\">Baladeo 34 Gram Pocket Knife</a> - This folding knife from Baladeo is the other end of the spectrum from the Big Rock above. At just <strong>1.2 ounces, or 34 grams</strong> as the name suggests, it's an extremely lightweight option. It does, however, have a <strong>respectably long 3.6 inch blade</strong>, and even a <strong>serrated section</strong> on the blade. So while it's extremely small and lightweight, it at least does not lack for options.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sog-knives-flash-ii-knife\">SOG Knifves Flash II</a> - The Flash II is a <strong>folding knife with a little more strength and durability</strong> behind it. It uses <strong>high quality steel for the 3.5 inch blade</strong>, and has SOG's very fast assisted opening action, for an easy, quick draw. It also has a <strong>serrated section</strong> on the blade, and weighs a total of <strong>4.2 ounces, or 119 grams</strong>, which is not all that light for a folding knife. But more than anything this knife is about quality.</li>

For one, they’re quite a bit lighter than anything that you might have in your cupboards, which is important if you’re going to be carrying your camping plates and cups. Many of them are also ideal to rougher outdoor world, where there are much fewer level surfaces and other amenities.
<h2>Camping Plates and Cups</h2>
What to look for when reviewing camping plates and cups.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Before you go out and get camping plates and cups you need to decide what material you want them to be made from. Plastic is always a cheap and lightweight option, but there are also a number of metal options, like titanium, that are strong, lightweight and have the added benefit of not being plastic.</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – With camping cookware it’s always best to go with items that are versatile. With plates especially, it helps to get something that has high sides, for instance, so that the plate can be used for soups, as <!--more-->well as messy stuff like stews or pasta, that will end up on the ground if you go with a flat plate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Plates and Cups</h2>
Some of the very best camping plates and cups sets to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799278/rei-campware-group-tableware-set\">REI Campware Group Tableware Set</a> - This is a set for a group of 4. It <strong>includes 4 cups, 4 plates and finally 4 bowls, plus a handy mesh bag</strong> to hold everything. Each piece in the set is made with very <strong>rugged polypropylene plastic</strong>, which is an ideal material to make tableware out of. The whole thing weighs 31.5 ounces, or 893 grams, but remember that's a set for four people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/x-sets\">Sea to Summit X-Sets</a> - Sea to Summit makes several excellent tableware pieces with the X prefix. What each has in common is that the <strong>side are collapsible</strong>, so your cup, for instance, <strong>turns in to a relatively flat disk</strong>, which makes it quite a bit easier to store in your backpack. You can get a set of just the X-Bowl and X-Mug, or get a set that includes those two, plus the X-Plate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-infinity-tableset-1-person\">GSI Outdoors Infinity Tableset</a> - This is another <strong>polypropylene set</strong> similar to the REI offering above, but with a few extras that might be worth taking a look at. First, it includes a glass in addition to a mug, but what most people will find useful is the <strong>addition of a knife, fork and spoon, all made from polypropylene</strong>. So a slightly more complete set. It's just for one person, however, and weighs 15.5 ounces, or 439 grams.</li>

It means there’s more space in your backpack for other important things, and it also generally means less weight for you to be carrying around. And there are some definite things to look for if what you want is a small, lightweight sleeping bag.
<h2>Small Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a small sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> – In the choice between down and synthetic insulation, down is a much more compact choice. It packs down a lot smaller than synthetic insulation, relative to the warmth provided, and is also generally lighter, again relative to the warmth provided. Even more than that, higher quality down is better than lower quality down.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – There’s no denying that a mummy shaped sleeping bag is smaller than a rectangular sleeping bag. By eliminating all of that excess material you make the sleeping bag <!--more-->quite a bit smaller. Eliminating all of the unused space inside the sleeping bag also means that you will stay warmer at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Small Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the best and smallest sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - With a <strong>minimum temperature of just 35 degrees</strong>, this is a sleeping bag best used for just summer use in most parts of the world. The benefit, of that, of course, is that it doesn't have to be very big or thick. And the <strong>850 fill down, half length zipper and extra large square baffles</strong> all help to further reduce bulk and weight. And at just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong> it's definitely a lightweight and small sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - The Laser 600 has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong>, so only a little warmer than the HighLite above. But 32 degrees puts it in to the range for three season camping in many parts of the world. The Laser 600 also <strong>uses 900 fill down</strong>, which is the high quality stuff, plus a <strong>narrow mummy cut</strong> and a short zipper to reduce the bulk of the sleeping bag as much as possible. The whole thing weighs just <strong>1 pound 6.2 ounces, which is 630 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795982/mountain-hardwear-phantom-15-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - The Phantom is a four season sleeping bag, depending on how cold your winters are, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>. It uses<strong> 800 fill down</strong>, and features like a full length zipper and draft collar that come in handy in cold temperatures. But at the same time it has a <strong>narrow mummy cut</strong>, to minimize wasted space. That narrow cut makes for a very small and relatively lightweight sleeping bag, at just <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 870 grams</strong>.</li>

One of the clearest advantages of using an inflatable sleeping mat over a foam mat is that the inflatable mat is not nearly as bulky. Of course it’s just about impossible to damage a foam sleeping mat, while the same certainly cannot be said of inflatable sleeping mat. So there are pros, and also cons.
<h2>Inflatable Sleeping Mat</h2>
What to look for when shopping for an inflatable sleeping mat.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Sleeping mats come in a rectangular shape, a mummy shape and every shape in between. A mummy shaped sleeping mat definitely saves on weight, but might be a little small for someone who likes to toss and turn at night. A rectangular sleeping mat is heavier, of course, but gives you some room to move around at night.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – It’s also important to consider the R-value of your sleeping pad, especially if you plan on doing any winter camping. A high R-value is indicative of a sleeping mat that will reflect a good amount of body<!--more--> heat, and in the winter time you need all of the body heat that you can get to stay toasty warm.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Inflatable Sleeping Mat</h2>
The very best inflatable sleeping mats to keep you comfortable in the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is an extremely popular inflatable sleeping pad, in part because it <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. But it's also popular because it's a <strong>rectangular inflatable sleeping pad that weighs just 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, which is a rather impressive weight. It's also <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong>, so plenty comfortable, and has an <strong>R-value of 2.5</strong>, so plenty warm for three season use. A solid all-around inflatable sleeping mat.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - The DownMat is not lightweight, at <strong>34.6 ounces, which is 980 grams</strong>, but it also has an <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, making it <strong>suitable down to -36</strong>, and compared to sleeping mats with a similar R-value it's impressively lightweight. Part of the reason for that is that it uses <strong>700 fill down on the top</strong> of the mat to add warmth, whereas most other four season sleeping mats use foam for insulation. It's also <strong>3.5 inches thick</strong>, so very comfortable, and even comes in a larger deluxe size that is wider and longer, for extra comfy nights in the cold.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - The Clearview is made with value in mind. It's <strong>one of the cheaper inflatable sleeping pads</strong> around, and isn't much beyond just a basic sleeping pad. The <strong>R-value is just 1</strong>, for example, so you cant expect it to add much in the way of warmth to your sleeping experience. It does, however, come in a <strong>few different shapes and lengths, including a mummy shape</strong>, and <strong>weighs just 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, which for the basic price, is certainly a decently light weight. So not feature rich, but still with some definite positives, including a low price.</li>

There are, however, many other fuel options for powering a camping stove, solid fuels being one of them. A <strong>solid fuel camping stove</strong> will typically be able to use the several different kinds of solid fuel that exist. Esbit tablets are one popular solid fuel, for instance, but wood or even debris like pine cones also make excellent solid fuel for a camping stove that is able to utilize them.
<h2>Solid Fuel Camping Stove</h2>
What to look for if you want a solid fuel camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Types</strong> – As alluded to above there are several different kinds of solid fuel out there, and not all solid fuel stoves will be able to work with all of them. So it’s a good idea to make sure of what exact solid fuels your stove will work with. For the sake of versatility, the more you can use the better off you will be.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Another important variable when it comes to a solid fuel camping stove is weight. Most of these kinds of camping stoves will weigh less, because you don’t need all of the complex equipment that goes in to regulating highly <!--more-->combustible fuels like propane. But even so, the difference between heavy and lightweight solid fuel stoves can be striking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Solid Fuel Camping Stove</h2>
Some of the best choices for a solid fuel camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-hexagon-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - For burning a wide variety of solid fuels that you might find in the wilderness, the Hexagon is ideal. It will accommodate wood just as easily as it will pine cones, brush or whatever else you can get your hands on. It's a <strong>basic hexagon shaped piece of titanium</strong>, <strong>sloped inwards towards the top</strong> so that the heat is concentrated on the bottom of your pot, which sits on top. It even <strong>folds down when you're not using it</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/653343/esbit-pocket-stove\">Esbit Pocket Stove</a> - If you would prefer to use <strong>Esbit tablets</strong> as your solid fuel, the Pocket Stove is a simple and very popular choice. It's a <strong>small little stand that has room for an Esbit tablet beneath your pot</strong>. And when you're not using it, it <strong>folds down for easy storage</strong>. Very basic and straight forward. It even comes with 6 Esbit tablets. The whole thing <strong>weighs 3.25 ounces, or 92 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove</a> - If you want to burn solid fuels like wood, but want to keep your options open then the DX is a fantastic choice. <strong>Besides solid fuels it will also burn alcohol</strong>, so as long as you have a little backup alcohol along, not being able to find any wood lying around will never be a problem. The whole thing is also <strong>made of titanium</strong>, so it weighs a very slim <strong>3 ounces, which is 86 grams</strong>.</li>

Like most other pieces of ultralight backpacking gear, an <strong>ultralight backpacking knife</strong> is a great idea just because it saves you from carrying around any more weight than you need to be. The lighter your backpack is, the more you will be able to think about something else other than getting your backpack off.
<h2>Ultralight Backpacking Knife</h2>
What to look for in an ultralight backpacking knife.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Folding or Fixed</strong> – There are two main kinds of backpacking knives, which are folding and fixed blade knives. Folding knives tend to be lighter, which makes them ideal for ultralight backpackers. It must be said, however, that fixed blade knives are stronger, and a better choice if you use your knife quite a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Length</strong> – The longer your knife is the more it is going to weigh, all other things being equal. So getting a<!--more--> knife with a short blade length is definitely a good idea if you’re looking for an ultralight backpacking knife. Of course you don’t want to get a knife so short that it becomes unusable for whatever you use it for.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Backpacking Knife</h2>
Some of the best possible choices for an ultralight backpacking knife.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/delilah-s-peck-razor\">Columbia River Delilah's Peck Razor</a> - With a <strong>blade length of just 1.88 inches</strong> and a total weight of just <strong>.9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>, this is about the smallest and lightest backpacking knife you're likely to find, and if you want something ultralight, it would be hard to  do better than this. It's<strong> a folding knife</strong>, of course, and actually <strong>doubles as a money clip</strong>. It's made from stainless steel, but beyond that there's not much to say. Very small, and very light.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/826733/baladeo-34g-superlight-pocket-knife\">Baladeo 34G Superlight Pocket Knife</a> - This is only slightly heavier than the Peck above, at <strong>1.2 ounces, or 34 grams</strong> like it says in the name, but with a <strong>3.75 inch blade</strong> it's significantly bigger than the very small Peck above. It's <strong>stainless steel, and even includes a belt clip</strong>, but has a very minimal handle and is a very minimalist backpacking knife, and definitely an ultralight backpacking knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sog-knives-field-pup-knife\">SOG Knives Field Pup Knife</a> - The Field Pup is ideal if you would prefer a <strong>fixed length ultralight backpacking knife</strong>. The <strong>blade is 4 inches long</strong>, and since it's made by SOG it's good, high quality steel, which is reflected in the price. It comes with a sheath, of course, and at just <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>, it's one of the lightest fixed length backpacking knives you will find anywhere.</li>

But there are plenty of other things that will determine how lightweight a sleeping bag is, regardless of whether it is down or not. But you really do owe it to yourself to look at <strong>lightweight down sleeping bags</strong>, and you will be happy you did on the second or third day of a camping or backpacking trip.
<h2>Lightweight Down Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of what to look for when reviewing lightweight down sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Not all down is created equal. If you compare a 700 fill down sleeping bag and a 900 fill sleeping bag, both of which provided the same amount of warmth, you would find that the 900 fill down sleeping bag weighed less, because the down is better at puffing up, or lofting, and so provides more warmth, relative to weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Another important variable that determines how much a sleeping bag weighs is the shape. By eliminating all the corners of a rectangular sleeping bag and tapering it some you end up with a mummy shaped sleeping <!--more-->bag, and a lot less material used overall, which of course lowers the weight of the sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Down Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best lightweight down sleeping bags for your next adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - The HighLite is an <strong>ideal summer sleeping bag</strong>, or even three season sleeping in warmer parts of the world, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>. But what really makes it impressive is the <strong>1 pound weight, or 453 grams</strong>, which is fantastically lightweight. It's features like <strong>850 fill down</strong>, large, square baffles and a half length zipper that help it get that low. So an extremely lightweight summer down sleeping bag.</li>

Where people often have problems is in two different areas. One is taking a three season camping or backpacking in the winter, and getting wet as a result of the tent being unable to cope with the harsh winter conditions. People also often get wet as a result of condensation gathering on the inside of a tent as the night progresses, which is more of a ventilation problem then a waterproofing problem.
<h2>Waterproof Tent</h2>
What to look for when you want a waterproof tent for camping or backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Single or Double Wall</strong> – Many winter tents are actually single wall tents. Which might seem like it would make them less waterproof, but with a good fabric all the water will stay on the outside. What’s important on a single wall tent is that there is plenty of ventilation, so that condensation never has a chance to accumulate.</li>
	<li><strong>Season Appropriate</strong> – A three season tent is not the kind of thing that you want to take in to bad winter weather. Getting wet in winter is often a result of a three season tent being inadequate to the bad winter<!--more--> weather, so if you’re going winter camping or backpacking, you might need a four season tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Tent</h2>
Some of the best waterproof tents to take in to rainy weather.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-ultra-light-tent-1-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1</a> - If you want something lightweight, that you could take backpacking as easily as you could take camping, then the Fly Creek is perfect. It has<strong> room for one</strong>, and is <strong>small and lightweight, at just 2 pounds 3 ounces, or 992 grams</strong>. It's also a 2 wall, free standing tent, which isn't common for a weight that low. And while the superior design and materials needed to get the weight that low do bump the price up, you really cant put enough emphasis on weight when you will be carrying your tent. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-tent-ul2-2-person-3-season\">2 man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent-3-person-3-season\">3 man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent-4-person-3-season\">4 man</a> version.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/thor-3-tent-3-person-4-season\">Marmot Thor 3</a> - If you really, truly want to stay dry in the worst weather, then you need a <strong>four season tent</strong>. The Thor has room for 3 inside, <strong>2 doors and a solid, waterproof exterior</strong> that will help you weather the worst weather. Since it's a 4 season tent is also has plenty of poles, and a few convenient guyout points for really making it in to a bomb proof tent. At <strong>10 pounds 12 ounces, or 4.88 kilograms</strong> it's certainly not lightweight, but then bomb proof tents rarely are.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731378/rei-camp-dome-2-tent\">REI Camp Dome 2</a> - If all you want is a waterproof tent to take for a little recreational camping then the Camp Dome line from REI is a good choice. It's a <strong>basic dome tent with a very low price</strong>, ideal for value focused customers. It has <strong>room inside for 2, and even 2 doors</strong>, for good ventilation options. It's freestanding, and comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">4 man version</a> as well, if you want something a little larger with a focus on value. At <strong>4 pounds 15 ounces, which is 2.24 kilograms</strong> it's not exactly lightweight, but not especially heavy either. So an excellent waterproof tent for the value conscious customer.</li>

You want to be careful, however, to balance the weight of your sleeping pad with the comfort of your sleeping pad. A lightweight sleeping pad will make your load a little lighter, but if you don’t get any sleep that’s not going to matter very much.
<h2>Lightest Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look for when you want the lightest sleeping pad possible.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foam or Inflatable</strong> – If you really want the lightest sleeping pad possible then you are likely going to want a foam sleeping pad. Which is not to say, however, that there are no lightweight inflatable sleeping pads. If you want the additional comfort of an inflatable sleeping pad, there are certainly lightweight options available.</li>
	<li><strong>Length</strong> – One way to save weight with a sleeping pad is to get a short length. Your feet and lower legs generally don’t need much, if any padding, and getting rid of that much of the<!--more--> sleeping pad will reduce the weight by quite a bit. Similarly, a mummy shaped sleeping pad gets rid of a lot of excess material as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Lightest Sleeping Pad Reviews</h2>
A few reviews of the lightest sleeping pads on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/inertia-x-frame-sleeping-pads\">Klymit Inertia X Frame</a> - The X Frame is in fact just a frame. <strong>Rather than being a uniform sleeping pad, it's a series of attached inflated tubes</strong>, so that you have just the essential inflation, and no more. Really, there's no substitute for seeing it. The end result, however, is an extremely lightweight sleeping pad, at <strong>just 9.1 ounces, or 257 grams</strong>. It's only <strong>1.5 inches thick</strong>, and because there's pieces missing it's a little difficult to calculate an R-value, but still, if you want the lightest inflatable sleeping pad, this is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is not especially lightweight, compared to the X Frame above, at <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, but it's one of the <strong>lightest conventional sleeping pads around</strong>. If you want a lightweight rectangular, inflatable sleeping pad, then this is it. It <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and is one of, if not the most popular sleeping pad out there. It's <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong>, which is more than enough, and has a <strong>2.5 R-value</strong>,which is warm enough for spring, summer, and fall in most places. So if you want lightweight and a conventional design, this is it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-torso-length.html\">Gossamer Gear Nightlight</a> - The Nightlight is another unconventionally designed sleeping pad. It's foam, but it's just <strong>29 inches long, and is intended for just your torso</strong>, so that your lower body hangs off the end. If you're used to hard sleep then it's not much a burden, but if you're not used to it, it might seem a little uncomfortable. But at about <strong>3.5 ounces, or 100 grams</strong> you're not going to find anything lighter than this. It also comes in a heavier, <a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-3-4.html\">59 inch long version</a>.</li>

What is important, however, is that you choose a pair of hiking shoes that wont give you foot problems. When your feet are happy, after all, then you can enjoy the hiking experience. But when you start getting blisters and hot spots, every step can be uncomfortable or even painful, which makes everything else a lot less enjoyable, which is why you really need good shoes for hiking.
<h2>Shoes for Hiking</h2>
What to look at when you're looking for shoes for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Heavier hiking shoes will tire you out faster. You wont notice much at first, but over an entire day of hiking, that slight addition of weight to your feet really starts to take its toll, and a pair of lightweight shoes for hiking will leave you feeling a lot better than a heavier pair would.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Most hiking shoes are not waterproof, and leave waterproofing to the boots. But if you want a pair of waterproof shoes for hiking, there are some excellent options available to you. Just remember that you have to balance waterproof with<!--more--> breathable, which might be a more valuable option, especially for those hot summer days when there’s no water in sight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Shoes for Hiking</h2>
Some of the very best shoes for hiking, for men and women too.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/f-lite-195-trail-running-shoe-unisex\">Inov8 F-lite 195 Shoes</a> - These are actually <strong>unisex hiking shoes</strong>, which is why there's no women's shoes linked to. The main feature of the F-Lite 195s is their weight. At<strong> just 6.8 ounces, or 195 grams</strong> they're extremely lightweight. They have a <strong>very thin sole, along with a mesh upper</strong> that will keep your feet well ventilated. They're definitely not waterproof, and are made for good weather, or for moving very fast in bad weather. So a pair of extremely lightweight shoes for hiking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829185/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-mens\">New Balance MT10 Minimum Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814347/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Minimus shoes are similar to the F-Lite shoes above, in that they're <strong>designed with minimalism in mind</strong>, as the name suggests. They have a <strong>relatively thin sole, and a mesh upper</strong> for plenty of ventilation, but at <strong>14 ounces, which is 396 grams</strong> they're a bit more substantial than the F-Lite shoes. So another lightweight hiking shoe, but with a little more substance behind it, for those that treat their gear hard.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-mens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Hedgehogs are at the other end of the spectrum from the two pairs above. They <strong>weigh 1 pound 3 ounces, or 538 grams</strong>, and have a <strong>thicker sole, for more padding, along with a a Gore Tex XCR liner</strong> to help keep your feet dry. So more of a traditional hiking shoe, with plenty of padding for what's underfoot, and even a way to keep your feet dry. They wont ventilate as well because of the waterproof liner, so maybe not the best choice for warm weather, but ideal shoes for hiking in wet weather.</li>

If sleeping bags didn’t do this, backpacks would have to be a lot bigger than they currently are. And if you want your sleeping bag really compact, you need a <strong>compression sack for sleeping bag</strong>. Many sleeping bags come with one, but if yours didn’t, or if you lost or damaged yours, then there are some excellent compression sacks for use with a sleeping bag.
<h2>Compression Sack for Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a compression sack for a sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Volume</strong> – Obviously, you want to be sure that your sleeping bag is going to fit in to the compression sack to begin with, otherwise it’s not going to do you much good. So make sure that you don’t get a compression sacks that’s too small. At the same time, you don’t want a gigantic compression sack that is too big, either.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Compression sacks come made of a few different materials. Some, like eVent for instance, are waterproof, which might be something you want from a compression sack. Others, like just basic nylon, wont keep your <!--more-->sleeping bag dry, but they will end up costing quite a bit less, so something to keep in mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Compression Sack for Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of your best options for a sleeping bag compression sack.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-event-compression-dry-sack\">Sea to Summit eVent Compression Sack</a> - Your  <strong>first and best choice</strong> when looking for a sleeping bag compression sack is this option from Sea to Summit. It's <strong>made with eVent, which is a waterproof but also very breathable fabric</strong> ideal for storing a sleeping bag in. It comes in a few different sizes, which <strong>range from 6 liters all the way up to 30 liters</strong>, which will accommodate many different sizes of sleeping bags. It also <strong>won the 2007 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so a seriously good sleeping bag compression sack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/766677/sea-to-summit-ultra-sil-compression-sack\">Sea to Summit Ultra Sil Compression Sack</a> - This is another possible compression sack that could be used with a sleeping bag from Sea to Summit. The difference is that this one is <strong>made with siliconized nylon, which will keep a lot of water out, but not all of it</strong>.

It also comes in <strong>sizes ranging from 6 liters up to 30 liters</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/round-rock-solid-compression-sack\">Granite Gear Round Rock Solid Compression Sack</a> - One more  possible compression sack for a sleeping bag, this one made with <strong>just straight nylon, which wont do much to keep your sleeping bag dry</strong>, but also wont weigh that much either, so a good option for saving weight.

If you are going winter camping, for instance, then you are going to want to buy a four season tent that will be able to stand up to ugly winter weather that might wreck a three season tent. Of course, the seasons of the year that your tent is appropriate for is only one of several different things that you need to consider.
<h2>Buy Tents</h2>
What to look for when you want to buy tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – One of the more important things that you need to decide on is how big your tent is going to be. More specifically, it’s often helpful to compare the floor space of tents. Two may both be called 3 man tents, but they will not necessarily have the same amount of floor space available.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Another important consideration is the weight of the tent. If you’re not going to be carrying your tent, if you’re just car camping for example, then it might not be too much of a concern. But if you’re going <!--more-->to be carrying a tent while camping or backpacking, you will be wishing you had paid a little more for the lightweight tent at the end of the trip.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Recommend Tents to Buy</h2>
Some of the better possible tents to buy, based on the above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731378/rei-camp-dome-2-tent\">REI Camp Dome Tent</a> - If all you need is something basic to get you through the night without getting you dry, a little recreational camping, then the Camp Dome is an ideal tent for you. The<strong> price is very low</strong>, and it's really just a <strong>basic 2 person, dome tent</strong>. It has <strong>2 doors</strong>, which is nice, though no vestibule, which might be a feature that you want. It's also a bit heavy, at <strong>4 pounds 15 ounces, or 2.24 kilograms</strong>. But again, the price is right. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">4 man size</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-1-tent-1-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL1</a> - The Fly Creek is the <strong>kind of tent you want for backpacking</strong>. With <strong>room inside for just 1</strong>, and a weight of just <strong>1 pound 14 ounces, or 850 grams</strong>, it's light enough to throw in to your backpack and just about forget about. It's also a freestanding tent, which is impressive for the weight. Of course a tent doesn't get that light without utilizing a few expensive features and materials, so the cost is a little high. But if you need something lightweight for backpacking, this is an ideal option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-meta-2p-tent-2-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Meta 2P</a> - This is something a little different from NEMO. It's a <strong>single wall tent</strong>, for starters, and you can also <strong>use trekking poles, rather than the tent poles, as supports for the tent</strong>. So if you carry trekking poles and you can save weight and bulk by leaving the tent poles at home. And of course the single wall design helps keep the bulk and weight down. There's <strong>room inside for 2</strong>, and also a nice, big vestibule. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.33 kilograms</strong>.</li>

The problem, however, is that a lifetime of wearing shoes has done a poor job of training your feet for the abuse that something like barefoot hiking can inflict. So <strong>barefoot hiking shoes</strong> are a good compromise. They protect your feet from the sharp rocks, thorns and other debris that you often find on the typical hiking trail, but get rid of all of that excess material between you and ground, and let you feel what you’re hiking on.

	<li><strong>Toes</strong> – Many people’s first introduction to the idea of barefoot anything are Vibram FiveFingers. They’re good for walking around town, for running, and also for hiking. Vibram makes a few models that are specifically made for hiking, but the basic models also do a great job of giving you a barefoot hiking experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – The thicker the material between you and the ground is, the less you will be able to feel what’s underneath you. If you’re just starting out with barefoot<!--more--> hiking you might want a little padding, but for those more experienced barefooters, a thinner sole is a lot closer to the barefoot hiking experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Barefoot Hiking Shoes</h2>
Some of the best options for barefoot hiking shoes for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/f-lite-195-trail-running-shoe-unisex\">Inov8 F-Lite 195 Shoes</a> - With just a <strong>3 millimeter footbed</strong>, these are a great way to get close to the ground, without actually walking on the ground. Even better, they <strong>weigh just 6.8 ounces, or 195 grams</strong>, which is alluded to in the name. So if you want barefoot shoes that are also extremely lightweight, these are an ideal choice. They're just <strong>mesh on top</strong>, there's no waterproofing to speak of, and they're actually <strong>unisex</strong>, so these are both the men's and women's model.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoe-mens\">New Balance MT10 Minimus Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoe-womens\">Women's</a>) - These are a <strong>bit thicker and sturdier</strong>, and a good starting point for someone looking to get started with barefoot hiking. The <strong>soles are quite thin</strong>, but do offer some amount of support, which is ideal if your feet aren't used to a lack of padding just yet. They're also just <strong>mesh on top</strong>, so plenty of ventilation. But at <strong>14.2 ounces, or 402 grams</strong> for the pair, they're the heaviest barefoot hiking shoes on the list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805275/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-mens\">Vibram FIveFingers TrekSport Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804306/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Vibram FiveFingers are what most people think of when they think of barefoot hiking shoes. They're the ones with <strong>individual toes</strong>. These, however, are a little different from the basic FiveFingers. They actually have a slightly thicker, <strong>4 millimeter footbed</strong>, and also some added traction on the bottom of them, so that you can be sure about your footing on uneven and slippery trails. Of course these are ideal if you plan on getting wet in the course of hiking, because they will dry quickly, and you probably wont be wearing socks with them. <strong>The original barefoot hiking shoes</strong>, and still an excellent option.</li>

So if you want a <strong>heavy fleece jacket</strong>, what you need is a 300 weight fleece jacket, or possibly a 200 weight fleece jacket. With a fleece weight like that you will stay warm to far lower conditions than you otherwise would with something like micro fleece or 100 weight fleece.
<h2>Heavy Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for in a heavy fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Your fleece can be as heavy you as you want, but if you want a fleece that will resist wind chill and keep you warm, it’s best to get one with a hardened exterior. That way, wind chill bounces off of your heavy fleece jacket, rather than penetrating it.</li>
	<li><strong>Pockets</strong> – If warmth is your goal then you should be looking for a few additional features from your fleece jacket to help keep you warm, like pockets. Another good thing to<!--more--> have if you want to stay warm is a hood, to trap all the warmth that otherwise escapes from the head.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Heavy Fleece Jacket</h2>
Some of the best options for a heavy fleece jacket, for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Fleece Hooded Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-softshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Hyllus is a <strong>versatile and technical heavy fleece jacket</strong>, ideal for cold weather on isolated mountains. It has <strong>a hood, plus a couple of zippered hand warmer pockets</strong> to keep your head and fingers warm. It also has a hardened soft shell outer exterior to compliment the 300 weight fleece, so that you're <strong>protected as much as possible from both moisture and wind</strong>. So not a cheap option, but if you plan to be getting in to some bad weather, this is the heavy fleece jacket you want to be wearing.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785468/mountain-hardwear-monkey-man-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Fleece Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - Another heavy <strong>300 weight fleece jacket</strong>, this one with something unusual. The <strong>outer surface is actually quite plush and piled</strong>, so that it has an almost furry texture. This actually helps to cut down, a bit, on wind, though obviously the outer surface isn't actually hardened. There's no hood, so you'll have to find another way to keep your head warm, but there are a <strong>couple of zippered hand warmer pockets</strong>, plus a zippered pocket on the chest for storing a few small essentials.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/r4-jacket-men-s\">Patagonia R4 Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/r4-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - The R4 is a good, solid but basic fleece jacket. There's no word on what exactly the weight of the fleece is, but it's <strong>Patagonia's heaviest fleece jacket</strong>, and their best option for those that want to stay warm. It also has a fairly low profile and athletic cut, so a good layering option. There's no hood, but like the Monkey Man above it has a <strong>couple of zippered hand pockets, plus one zippered chest pocket</strong>. So another solid heavy fleece jacket option for around town, hiking and the like.</li>

In such conditions, most tents will do an acceptable job of keeping you dry and comfortable all night long. But when you head in the mountains, and especially in to higher elevations, you need to be looking at <strong>mountain tents</strong> that will be best suited to the unique conditions that are often found in the mountains. Specifically, you will want tents that can resist the wind well.
<h2>Mountain Tents</h2>
What you want to see from mountain tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Freestanding</strong> – In the mountains you wont always be able to find a nice patch of ground where you can use stakes, and so it’s usually a good idea to have a free standing tent. That way, you don’t have to worry about finding the perfect camping spot, and you can set up just as easily on a slab of rock as you could on dirt.</li>
	<li><strong>Wind Resistant</strong> – One of the more severe weather conditions encountered in the mountains is high wind. Generally, the more poles your tent has, the stronger it will be when the wind starts blowing. Similarly, a tent with <!--more-->low, sloped walls will shed wind a lot better than a tall tent with high sides.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Mountain Tents</h2>
Some of the very best mountain tents for those nights in high places.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dragontail-tent-2-person-4-season\">MSR Dragontail Tent</a> - The Dragontail is actually <strong>a tunnel tent, rather than a dome tent</strong>, which actually makes it very strong without as many poles, which is ideal for mountain conditions. It uses <strong>3 ribs to create a tunnel</strong> around the tent, the main benefit for the people sleeping inside being plenty of head room to sit up in. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, which does nothing to impact performance, provided that you use the Dragontail's venting properly, while cutting down on weight. And at <strong>4 pounds 6 ounces, or 1.99 kilograms</strong>, it's certainly a relatively lightweight option. So a mountain tent with an uncommon design.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/739349/rei-mountain-3-tent\">REI Mountain 3 Tent</a> - If you would prefer to spend time in the mountains without spending too much on a tent, then REI's line of tents is usually a safe bet. The <strong>Mountain 3 isn't cheap, but compare to most other mountain tents it is</strong>. As the name suggests there is <strong>room inside for 3</strong>. It also has <strong>5 tent poles</strong>, so plenty of strength, and has a decently sized vestibule too, which is nice for keeping gear dry at night. But with an inner tent and a rain fly, it's certainly not lightweight, at <strong>8 pounds 13 ounces, or 4 kilograms</strong>. So a decent choice if you want to save money. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/739354/rei-mountain-2-tent\">2 man version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-dome-5-tent-5-person-4-season\">The North Face Dome 5</a> - The Dome 5 is the kind of mountain tent you want for a big group. With <strong>room for 5 inside</strong>, plus a very large vestibule, this tent will do duty for anything from camping to a base camp station. It has a <strong>total of 10 poles</strong>, so you can be sure there wont be any breaks from the wind, and <strong>two large doors for easy in and out access</strong>. At <strong>31 pounds 7 ounces, or 14.25 kilograms</strong> it's not even close to lightweight, and it's also far from cheap, but when you need something exceptional for the mountains, this is the kind of tent you want.</li>

But finding <strong>cheap trekking poles</strong> that are not cheaply built is not so difficult. Sales certainly help, but if you know what you are looking for, you can find a good, solid pair of trekking poles that wont make too of a dent in your wallet.
<h2>Cheap Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look for when you want cheap trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Your two main choices, when it comes to material for trekking poles, are aluminum and carbon fiber. Carbon fiber is a lighter option, but it’s also a more expensive option. So if you want cheap trekking poles, you’re likely going to want to stick to the heavier aluminum trekking poles.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed Length</strong> – There aren’t many fixed length trekking poles out there, but a straight shaft of metal, rather than three separate shafts and all extra parts needed to adjust length, generally<!--more--> costs less. With a fixed length trekking pole, of course, you have to know what specific length you want, because you’re stuck with it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Trekking Poles</h2>
Some of the best and cheapest trekking poles around.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784270/rei-traverse-trekking-poles-pair\">REI Traverse Trekking Poles</a> - These are a <strong>good, basic pair of trekking poles from REI</strong>, whose in house brand usually offers good, if basic products at very reasonable prices. They don't have much in the way of extras, but they're<strong> aluminum poles with three telescoping sections</strong> that will go anywhere from 26 inches to 55 inches. They're not particularly lightweight, at <strong>19.1 ounces, or 541 grams</strong> for the pair, but what really stands out about these trekking poles is the  low price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/distance-z-poles\">Black Diamond Distance Z-Poles</a> - The Z-Poles are something rare, they're <strong>fixed length</strong>. Rather than telescoping like most other poles, these <strong>fold like tent poles</strong>. The advantage of this is that they weigh a lot less than most other trekking poles.Even being <strong>aluminum, they weigh just 11.6 ounces, or 330 grams</strong>, and the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-distance-zpoles\">carbon fiber version</a> is more expensive, but weighs even less. So if you don't want to spend a lot but do want a pair of lightweight trekking  poles, these are ideal. Just be sure to get the right size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/leki-summit-antishock-trekking-poles-1-pair-lek0138\">LEKI Summit Antishock Trekking Poles</a> - One more pair of <strong>basic  telescoping aluminum trekking poles</strong>. These have a few very likable features, like <strong>cork handles</strong>, that you will definitely appreciate after long enough periods of use. And as the name suggests they have <strong>anti-shock built in</strong>, which is something else that starts to pay dividends after hours of use. They also weigh a more reasonable <strong>17.8 ounces, or 504 grams</strong>. So more expensive, but also better in a couple ways compared to the REI Traverse poles above.</li>

Of course the same is true for your head, which is why something like a <strong>down camping pillow</strong> can be a great piece of gear to have with you. It will help keep your head warm, and will of course also keep your head well padded, which is often a bit of a problem for many backpackers.
<h2>Down Camping Pillow</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a down camping pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – As with any down product, part of what you need to be concerned about is the quality of the down. Higher quality down will not loft as much, meaning that you will need more down inside the pillow to achieve the same amount of loft. And more down means a heavier pillow.</li>
	<li><strong>Compression</strong> – Part of what makes a down pillow great is that it can be compressed way down when it’s not being used, so that it doesn’t take up all kinds of room in your<!--more--> backpack. So it pays to make sure that your down pillow comes equipped with some method of compression, just like many down sleeping bags do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Camping Pillow</h2>
There aren't many, but these are the best down camping pillows.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814887/quixote-goose-down-pillow\">Quixote Goose Down Pillow</a> - First up, a seriously good down camping pillow from Quixote. It <strong>uses 650+ fill down</strong>, to provide plenty of comfort. And of course it stuffs down in to a tiny package in the morning, which is the main advantage of using down for just about any piece of camping gear. It <strong>doesn't come with a stuff sack</strong>, however, so you will need to find your own if you want to keep it separated in your backpack. It <strong>weighs a total of 6 ounces, or 170 grams</strong> for the small size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-cloudrest-down-pillow\">Western Mountaineering Cloudrest Down Pillow</a> - Another down pillow for camping, this one better suited to being used as a topper for some other bulky item that will do the elevating part. This is more just to provide comfort. It <strong>uses high quality, 800 fill down</strong>, which is definitely nice, and weighs less than the Quixote option, at <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>. Even better, <strong>there's a stuff sack built right in to the pillow</strong>, so you'll never lose it and you'll always be able to make it in a small package in the morning.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralite-pillow-case\">Therm-A-Rest Ultralite Pillow Case</a> - If you're looking at down pillows then chances are you might have other down gear, like a down jacket or sweater, for instance. If that's the case, then you could go with a <strong>padded pillow case and then use your down garments, or anything else really, to provide the bulk inside the pillow case</strong>. It's not a down pillow, but it accomplishes the same thing, and best of all, it's a lot easier to pack a pillow case in the morning than it is an entire pillow. It <strong>weighs 1 ounce, or 27 grams</strong>.</li>

What makes spray suitable for a bear to begin with is that it puts out a lot of spray, and the spray goes a long distance. You want to be able to convince the bear, before it gets close, to go elsewhere. As long as your bear spray is able to do that, it will be suitable for any kind of bear.
<h2>Grizzly Bear Spray</h2>
What to look for when you want grizzly bear spray.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Can Size</strong> – The bigger your can of bear spray is, the more spray you will have to work with. And if you have a larger can you will be able to spray for longer. Bigger cans can also sometimes spray a bit farther, and when a bear is coming towards you at a run, every foot of distance is very important.</li>
	<li><strong>Holster</strong> – A can of bear spray that is not accessible is worthless to you. You might not have much time to react to a bear, especially a more aggressive bear like a grizzly. So a holster <!--more-->or something else that makes your bear spray accessible at all times is just as important to have as the bear spray itself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Grizzly Bear Spray</h2>
There aren't many, but these are the best options for grizzly bear spray.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray (230 g)</a> - This the slightly smaller size of bear spray can made by Counter Assault. It's <strong>range is between 12 and 30 feet</strong>, and it<strong> sprays for approximately 7 seconds</strong>, which is more than enough when a grizzly is charging at you. You might also want to consider a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">holster</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray (290 g)</a> - The larger of the two canisters made by Counter Assault, this one will go for slightly longer, at <strong>9.2 seconds of spray time</strong>, and also has a slightly larger range, at <strong>anywhere from 12 feet to 32 feet</strong>. Again, it's a good idea to consider getting a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">holster</a> so you have somewhere convenient to put the spray.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-spray\">Frontiersman Bear Spray</a> - The Frontiersman bear spray can is slightly smaller than the two from Counter Assault, at just 225 grams. It <strong>comes with a holster</strong>, however, which is a smart piece of equipment to have. It <strong>will fire approximately 18 feet</strong>, so a shorter range of fire, and will <strong>spray for 8 seconds</strong>, so about the same as the two Counter Assault options.</li>

Just be aware that two person sleeping bags are not a good way to save on weight, like a two person tent is. If you’re looking to save weight, you’re better off with two lightweight, one person sleeping bags. But for cozying up at night, a sleeping bag for two is ideal.
<h2>Sleeping Bag for Two</h2>
What to look at when you want a sleeping bag for two.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Even with sleeping bags for two, there are rectangular shaped sleeping bags and then there are also more tapered options that will help cut down on weigh a bit. Another thing a tapered sleeping bag does is eliminate dead space within the sleeping bag, which helps keep you warmer at night.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – Your two main choices when it comes to the insulation inside your sleeping bag are synthetic insulation, which is cheaper, but also<!--more--> heavier, and down, which is lighter and more compactable, but also more expensive, and not the best choice when things get wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag for Two</h2>
Some of the best sleeping bags for two people to share at night.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-dream-island-sleeping-bag-15-degree-synthetic\">Big Agnes Dream Island Sleeping Bag</a> - This is a big, heavy sleeping bag for two ideal for car camping, but not a whole lot else. That said, car camping gear is usually the cheapest gear, and for a double sleeping bag with a <strong>minimum temperature of just 15 degrees</strong> it does indeed have a very reasonable price. It's also<strong> synthetic, and mostly rectangular in shape</strong>, with a hood for keeping your head warm. Specifically, it weighs <strong>9 pounds 5 ounces, or 4.22 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/king-solomon-15-double-bag-650-down\">Big Agnes King Solomon 15</a> - The King Solomon is another sleeping bag for two with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>. This one, however, is filled with <strong>600 fill down</strong>, which helps to bring the weight down to a much more reasonable <strong>5 pounds 3 ounces, or 2.53 kilograms</strong>, which is light enough that it would be a good option for backpackers. It also comes with a hood, and while it's definitely a more expensive option than the other Big Agnes bag above, it's also a lighter option, and much better for carrying.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808845/rei-siesta-35-double-sleeping-bag\">REI Siesta +35 Double Sleeping Bag</a> - One more sleeping bag for two, this one better suited for summer conditions, with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>. It uses <strong>synthetic insulation</strong>, but also a <strong>definite mummy shape</strong>, which helps to offset the heavier synthetic insulation. But even so, it weighs a total of <strong>8 pounds 12 ounces, or 3.9 kilograms</strong>, which is quite a bit more than the much warmer King Solomon above, so you can really see the difference in weight that insulation makes. So another good option for car camping, but not so much for backpackers or hikers. It also has a very reasonable price, which some will definitely appreciate.</li>

For that reasons, <strong>small tents</strong> are often ideal. They cut down on weight, for sure, but they also cut down on bulk, which means that you can be then cut down on the size of your backpack, or at least free up room inside your backpack for other important gear. Of course a tent that’s too small might feel a bit cramped, so it’s a balancing act.
<h2>Small Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing small tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trekking Pole Supports</strong> – One easy way to cut down on the bulk of your tent is to get one that will use trekking poles as tent poles. That way, if you carry trekking poles anyway, there are no poles to back in the morning, because you will be carrying your tent poles in either hand.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall</strong> – A good way to make your tent a smaller package when it comes to packing is to eliminate half of the fabric. A single wall tent will keep you dry, and wont suffer from <!--more-->condensation build up, as long as it is well ventilated. Besides cutting down on the size, a single wall tent will also cut down on weight quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Small Tents</h2>
Some of your best options when picking out a small tent.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2</a> - When it comes to small tents, there's not many smaller free standing tents than the Fly Creek series from Big Agnes. The UL2 version, which has<strong> room inside for two</strong>, is not especially roomy, but at just <strong>2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong> it's certainly lightweight, and will pack up in to a very small package. It's a <strong>two wall tent</strong> too, no single wall design here, and while it's not the cheapest tent around, it's certainly an excellent choice. It also <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, which helps, and even comes in a smaller <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">1 man version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-gogo-elite-tent-1-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Gogo Elite</a> - The Gogo Elite is, literally, a very small tent. It's <strong>actually more like a bivy sack</strong>, in that there's just enough room inside for you to lay down, and not much room in the way of vertical space. But unlike a bivy sack it will stay up off of your sleeping bag, which is crucial for staying dry. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, and the <strong>pole is actually inflatable, rather than aluminum</strong>, which definitely helps to save on weight and size. The whole thing also <strong>weighs just 1 pound 7 ounces, or 652 grams</strong>, which is impressively lightweight. So if you want something that is quite literally small, this is a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">TarpTent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is actually a relatively <strong>roomy 1 person tent</strong>, but it saves a lot of bulk and weight in two ways. First, it <strong>uses trekking poles, rather than tent poles as the supports</strong>. So as long as you use trekking poles, you don't have to carry tent poles. You can, however, purchase a pole if you don't use trekking poles. It's also <strong>a single wall design</strong>, so that there is a lot less material to pack up in the morning when it's time to go, which again saves on bulk. And at <strong>24.5 ounces, or 694 grams</strong> it's a very lightweight and small tent. The price is also very attractive if you are looking for a cheap small tent.</li>

Often, these are not going to be the tents that you want to be carrying for any significant amount of time, because they can get rather heavy, but for recreational camping they’re fine. But even so, there are a few certain things that you should definitely be looking for from a family camping tent, regardless of the price.
<h2>Cheap Family Tents</h2>
What to look at when looking to buy cheap family tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Doors and Partitions</strong> – With any group larger than four or so, you’re likely going to want a tent that has a partition, to help cut down on noise, and also 2 doors, so that people aren’t crawling over each other to reach the one door. Sleeping in such close proximity to other people can lead to a restless night, if you’re not careful.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re car camping then weight isn’t going to be much of a concern, but if you’re going to be carrying your family tent around, you’ll likely want a lighter family tent. With any group larger than 4, it’s often a better <!--more-->idea to go with two smaller tents, because the combined weight of the two smaller tents will often be less than those large tents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Family Tents</h2>
Some of the best cheap family tents to take next time you head to the campground.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">REI Camp Dome 4</a> - The Camp Dome is <strong>ideal for a smaller family of 4</strong>. It's just a <strong>basic dome tent with a price to reflect that</strong> basic design. It has <strong>2 doors</strong>, which is ideal, but unfortunately no vestibules, so you'll have to find somewhere else to keep your gear dry at night. But it comes with everything you need to make a night of it, and while the <strong>weight of 9 pounds 7 ounces, which is 4.28 kilograms</strong> means you probably wont want to carry this tent very far, the price is certainly very attractive.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/acadia-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Kelty Acadia 6</a> - Another <strong>basic dome tent</strong>, but this one <strong>with room for 6</strong>, which is an ideal size for bigger families, or else smaller families that want something really roomy. It <strong>weighs 14 pounds 3 ounces, or 6.7 kilograms</strong>, so again not a tent that you would want to carry very far, but the price is definitely right for a bit of recreational camping. It <strong>has 2 doors</strong>, but not internal partitions. It also has a bit of a vestibule, so that you have somewhere to put your shoes at night to keep them dry. But really, an excellent price for a 6 man tent, and a good choice for a little car camping or something similar.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-big-house-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Big House</a> - One more <strong>6 man tent</strong>, ideal for smaller families who want something roomy, or else larger families looking to squeeze everyone in under one roof. This is another larger tent with no internal partition, but it does at least have <strong>2 doors</strong>, so that you don't have to crawl over everyone in the middle of the night to reach the door. It <strong>weighs 13 pounds 10 ounces</strong>, which is slightly lighter than the 6 man Acadia above, but again not a tent that you would want to be carrying very far, but ideal for car camping or just some light recreational camping.</li>

And while this is sometimes true, bivy sacks can actually end up costing quite a bit, especially if you go for one with a high quality material. But finding a quality, <strong>cheap bivy sack</strong> is certainly not impossible. As long as you know what to look for, a cheap bivy sack that will keep you dry and not make you sweat isn’t too hard to find.
<h2>Cheap Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for from a cheap bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – If you’re looking for a cheap bivy sack then the material the bivy sack is made from is important. Gore Tex, for instance, is a good material for a bivy sack, but it’s also rather expensive, and if you want a cheap bivy sack, you are going to have to pick the material that you want carefully.</li>
	<li><strong>Supported</strong> – Many bivy sacks come with a pole or two over the face, so that the bivy sacks get up off of your sleeping bag, and you get a better amount of air circulation inside the<!--more--> bivy sack. But those extra design features generally mean a higher price tag, so if you want cheap, it’s best to avoid those bivy sacks with a support structure.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Bivy Sack</h2>
Some of the best cheap bivy sacks for keeping you happy outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794292/rei-minimalist-bivy-sack-regular\">REI Minimalist Bivy</a> - REI's in house brand is a reliable go to when you want reasonably price backpacking, camping or hiking gear. The Minimalist bivy is a <strong>combination of a nylon upper treated with REI's Elements laminate.</strong> The bottom is much tougher taffeta nylon, for maximum protection from whatever you lay the bivy sack on. The <strong>face portion is bug proof,</strong> and has an <strong>impressive 6 zippers to create small gaps for ventilation</strong>. It also weighs reasonably little, at <strong>15 ounces, or 430 grams</strong>. So while coated nylon is the most waterproof option, it's a good bivy sack for most conditions. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794291/rei-minimalist-bivy-long\">longer size</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-e-bivy\">MSR E-Bivy</a> - A cheap, if simple bivy sack from MSR. There's <strong>no bug net</strong> here, just a simple overlapped opening to keep you from getting rained on. The <strong>top of the bag is silnylon</strong>, while the <strong>bottom is tougher taffeta nylon with a waterproof coating</strong>, for more durable protection from the elements. So <strong>not entirely waterproof</strong>, but good enough for most weather. The whole thing does, however, weigh just <strong>9 ounces or 255 grams</strong>, so it's definitely a lightweight bivy sack option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/storm-bivi\">Rab Storm Bivi</a> - The Rab Storm Bivi is a 4 season bivy sack. It's <strong>both waterproof and breathable</strong>, thanks to the Hyperlite Storm fabric on top and the laminated nylon on the bottom. What stands out here is that the opening is along the top edge of the bivy sack, in a U shape, so that you can close the bivy sack up at night and be completely protected from the weather outside. So a <strong>better option for when the weather gets ugly</strong>, though you wont be able to see the stars at night. The whole thing <strong>weighs 17.2 ounces, or 490 grams</strong>.</li>

The <strong>best backpacking hammock</strong> will do everything that a backpacking tent might do, and will also provide you with the comfort that comes with sleeping in a hammock, which is difficult to compete with. And of course the right hammock will weigh less than the average tent, meaning you get to carry around less gear, which is never a bad thing.
<h2>Best Backpacking Hammock</h2>
What to look for when you want the best backpacking hammock possible.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Package</strong> – If you don’t already have some hammock gear, then what you likely want is a package. You need the hammock, of course, but you also need the hanging system to attach the hammock to a couple of trees, as well as a tarp to go over top of the hammock and keep you out of the rain.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Netting</strong> – Another thing that you might want to look for when getting a backpacking hammock is a hammock with built in bug netting. You cant count on being lucky enough to<!--more--> experience no bugs, and if you want to get any kind of restful sleep at night when the bugs are out, you need a backpacking hammock with some bug netting built in.</li>

<h2>Best Backpacking Hammock Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a few of the best backpacking hammocks.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-singlenest-hammock\">Eagle's Nest Outfitters SingleNest Hammock</a> - A great example of a hammock for taking backpacking. It will <strong>hold up to 400 pounds</strong>, which is quite a bit more than most other hammocks out there, and comes with carbiner clips on either end for hanging, though it does not come with the actual ropes needed for hanging, or a tarp for protecting you from the rain. So a <strong>great choice if you already have other gear to compliment just the hammock</strong>, or else want to customize the other parts necessary. It <strong>weighs 18 ounces, or 510 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dry-fly-rain-tarp\">Eagle's Nest Outfitters Dry Fly Rain Tarp</a> - The Dry Fly is exactly what you need for a hammock like the one above, which doesn't come with a tarp. It's ideally shaped to shed water away from you in your hammock without adding any unnecessary weight. It even <strong>comes with a compression stuff sack</strong> for in the morning when you're packing everything up. It <strong>weighs 1 pound 6 ounces, or 623 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight Asym Classic Hammock</a> - The Ultralight Asym is the full package. It <strong>includes the hammock with integrated bug net, a hanging system and even a tarp for keeping the rain off</strong>. It really is everything you need to be fully protected from nature at night while you sleep. It also has a fairly unique entry system, where you enter and exit via a split down the center of the hammock that is velcroed shut. It will <strong>hold a maximum of 250 pounds</strong>, and is definitely more expensive than the other options above, but you have to remember that you're getting everything in one neat package. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>.</li>

If you plan on going camping in the winter, for instance, then you are going to need a four season tent that will be able to handle things like heavy snow and blowing winds. On the other hand, a four season tent would be needlessly heavy for just some recreational camping.
<h2>Buy a Tent</h2>
What to look for when you want to buy a tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – One of the more important considerations to make when buying a tent is the weight of the tent. Any camping or backpacking gear that you are going to be carrying should be as lightweight as possible, so that you don’t tire yourself out too much. By the second or third day of a camping trip you are going to be wishing you had gotten the lightweight tent.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Of course one of the most basic decisions that you need to make before you buy a tent is how many people will be able to fit inside the tent. More specifically, it can<!--more--> be helpful to compare the actual square feet of floor space, because two 3 man tents will not necessarily have even close to the same amount of floor space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Tent Reviews</h2>
Some of the best tents in a few different categories, that you might consider buying.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731378/rei-camp-dome-2-tent\">REI Camp Dome Tent</a> - If you just want something cheap and easy for a bit of casual camping, then the Camp Dome tent from REI's in house brand is a perfect choice. It has a <strong>very attractive price</strong>, and is just a <strong>basic dome tent with an inner tent and a rain fly</strong>. There's <strong>room for 2 inside, and even 2 doors</strong>, though just awnings, no vestibules. It <strong>weighs 4 pounds 15 ounces, or 2.24 kilograms</strong>, so not the lightest tent ever, but as long as you wont be carrying it too much that's not much of a problem. So a good cheap tent. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">4 man size</a> for larger groups.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-meta-2p-tent-2-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Meta 2P Tent</a> - Something a little different and a little innovative from NEMO Equipment. What's different about the Meta is that you <strong>can actually use trekking poles as the tent poles</strong>, so a good choice for backpackers looking to save a little weight. It's not a free standing tent, but there's room inside for two, and it also <strong>has a nice, big vestibule</strong> for packing in equipment that you want kept dry. It's also a <strong>single wall design</strong>, which helps to cut down on weight as much as possible. At <strong>2 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.33 kilograms</strong> it's noticeably lighter than the Camp Dome tent above, which is the same size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2</a> - The Fly Creek is <strong>one of the lightest free standing, 2 wall tents</strong> on the market, and a great choice if you want the best. The Fly Creek UL2 actually<strong> won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a quality tent. Part of what makes it an award winner is the innovative design, which allows it to reach a low weight of <strong>just 2 pounds 2 ounces, or 963 grams</strong>, which is impressive for a 2 man tent. So a great tent to buy for backpacking or more serious outdoor adventures. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-4-tent-4-person-3-season\">4 man</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-3-tent-3-person-3-season\">3 man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-1-tent-1-person-3-season\">solo version</a> which might be more suitable for you.</li>

A <strong>thick foam sleeping pad</strong> will offer you quite a bit more comfort at night, which will let you sleep that much better. Of course a thicker foam sleeping pad is also going to be a bulkier, heavier sleeping pad, so you need to take that in to consideration.
<h2>Thick Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look at when you want a thick foam sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Contoured</strong> – Many thicker foam sleeping pads use contours to make the foam thicker, while at the same time keeping weight and bulk as low as possible. Many sleeping pads, for instance, have an egg carton design on the top. Another popular way to increase the thickness while keeping weight down is with ridges built in to the top of the sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – If you are concerned about the weight of your thick foam sleeping pad, one good way to get it down as low as possible is to get a mummy shaped sleeping pad. There aren’t too many mummy shaped foam sleeping pads, however, but you<!--more--> always have the option of hacking off a few corners with an exacto knife, since it’s just about impossible to break a foam sleeping pad.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thick Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
Some of the best thick foam sleeping pads for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z Lite</a> - The Z-Lite is one of the thickest pure foam sleeping pads on the market. It's a <strong>total of .75 inches thick</strong>, and has a <strong>egg crate design on the top</strong>, which maximizes thickness and comfort while keeping weight as low as possible. It's not super warm, with an <strong>R-value of 2.2 and a weight of 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, but it's an ideal choice for backpackers looking for a thick foam sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/two-track-pad-2-in\">Big Agnes Two Track Pad</a> - The Two Track is a warm, but relatively lightweight sleeping pad. It's <strong>inflatable, but also has 2 inches of foam on top</strong>, which adds insulation and also comfort. With an <strong>R-value of 6.5</strong> it's definitely a warm choice, though at <strong>36 ounces, or 1020 grams</strong> for the rectangular version it's not the lightest choice ever. The mummy shaped version does weigh a bit less. So a good choice if you want something relatively warm, but not unbearably heavy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/812011/exped-sim-comfort-10-lw-sleeping-pad\">Exped SIM Comfort 10 LW</a> - The SIM Comfort abandons all thoughts of lightweight design and goes all in for comfort. It's another <strong>combination of foam and inflation, with a total of 4 inches of padding</strong> between you and the ground, which is rather impressive. The <strong>R-value of 9.5</strong> is also rather impressive, as that makes it the warmest sleeping pad on the market. But at <strong>67.4 ounces, or 2.24 kilograms</strong> it's not even close to the kind of sleeping pad that you would want to carry backpacking. So very thick, but also very heavy.</li>

For example, water is heavy, but a water bottle can also be extremely heavy, and there are some very lightweight options out there. You might also want a bigger water bottle for hiking, so that you have plenty of water, rather than not having enough and having to ration yourself.
<h2>Best Water Bottle for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when you want the best water bottle for hiking with.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Different water bottles are made with different materials, each of which has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Stainless steel, for instance, is very durable and strong, but also much heavier than something like plastic, which can also be quite durable, but not to the same degree that stainless steel is.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Water bottles for hiking come in all different shapes and sizes. You might, for instance, want one large water reservoir to draw from, so that on a long day<!--more--> in hot temperatures you don’t have to worry about finding a water source and cleaning that water, and can just refill from your water reservoir.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Bottle for Hiking Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a select few of the best water bottles for hiking with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-cas0448\">Platypus Platty Plus Bottle</a> - The Platty is perfect for the hiker or backpacker looking for an innovative way to save on weight and bulk. The Platty Plus is <strong>actually made from flexible plastic, rather than hard plastic</strong> like a nalgene bottle, so that the structure of the bottle is provided, in part, by the water inside the bottle. And of course when you empty the bottle out it folds up inside your backpack, so that it takes up as little space as possible. It comes in a <strong>1 liter and 2 liter size</strong>, the <strong>1 liter weighing .8 ounces, or 22 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/402049/nalgene-wide-mouth-loop-top-round-bottle-32-fl-oz\">Nalgene Wide Mouth Loop Top Bottle</a> - The Nalgene Wide Mouth bottle is <strong>an absolute classic</strong>. This generation of the popular is <strong>BPA free</strong>, which is a definite bonus, but other than that it's the same Nalgene bottle that most people are familiar with already. It <strong>will hold .95 liters</strong>, has the loop on the lid so that you don't lose the lid and also so that you have something to hang the bottle by. The whole thing <strong>weighs in at 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams</strong>. So a definite classic.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/aluminum-water-bottle-24-oz\">Liberty Bottleworks Aluminum Water Bottle</a> - Most metal water bottles are made from stainless steel, since stainless steel is so tough. But stainless steel is also very heavy, whereas something like aluminum is quite a bit lighter, and if constructed properly, relatively strong. This<strong> aluminum water bottle</strong> from Liberty Bottleworks is actually made in the US from recycled aluminum, <strong>will hold .7 liters of water</strong> and weighs a very impressive <strong>.5 ounces, or 14 ounces</strong>, making it the lightest water bottle on the list, and a great choice, as long as you're the kind of person that doesn't try their gear too roughly.</li>

But if you’re a backpacker, hiker or something similar, you will likely want the <strong>lightest down jacket</strong> that you can get. Every little piece of gear adds weight to your backpack, after all, and it is better to be carrying a lightweight down jacket than it is to be carrying a heavy down jacket. Lighter down jackets also tend to be more compressible, another trait that backpackers, hikers and other, similar outdoor enthusiasts will appreciate.
<h2>Lightest Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want the lightest down jacket possible.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Everything else being equal, a 900+ fill down jacket will be lighter than a 800+ fill down jacket. The reason is that the 900+ fill down lofts better, and thus provides you with more warmth without adding weight. Not only that, the better quality down will compress down better, because there’s less of it for the same amount of warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If your goal is to have the lightest down jacket possible then you will likely want to do away with extras, like a hood. A hood could be useful, of <!--more-->course, but it adds weight. Even smaller features, like pockets, add weight and bulk that you might not want.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightest Down Jackets</h2>
Some of the best light down jackets for your next hiking or backpacking adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell Ex Light Down Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - At just <strong>5.7 ounces, or 161 grams</strong> for the men's, this is about as light as a down jacket gets. First, it <strong>uses 900+ fill down</strong>, which is the high quality stuff that weighs less for the same amount of warmth. It also comes without any extras, and that includes a hood and even hand warming pockets. It's a <strong>basic, stripped down down jacket</strong> designed for one thing, and that's saving as much weight as possible. So if you want the lightest down jacket possible, this is very likely it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultraight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - If you want light, but you want the features too, then this would be a better choice than the Ex Light above. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, which isn't quite as light as the 900 fill down of the Ex Light. But it also <strong>includes a hood and a couple of pockets for your hands, plus a zippered chest pocket</strong> for a few essentials. And while it's not as lightweight as the Ex Light, its weight of <strong>9 ounces, which is 255 grams</strong> is certainly not heavy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bitterroot-850-down-jacket-men-s\">GoLite Bitterroot 850 Down Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bitterroot-850-down-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - Another relatively <strong>lightweight down jacket, this one designed for slighter cooler temperatures</strong>. What you need to remember is that the less down there is inside the jacket there is, the lighter it will be, but also the colder it will be. So if you want to stay warm in cold temperatures, but also want a lightweight jacket, this might be a good choice. It uses <strong>850 fill down</strong>, as the name would suggest, and a hood, plus a couple of pockets for your hands. It weighs <strong>12 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>, but most of that extra weight, when you compare it to the lighter Patagonia jacket above, is extra down which goes towards keeping you warmer.</li>

A <strong>warm weather sleeping bag</strong> is the perfect example of this, since they are typically much smaller and lighter, and easier to pack than their winter counterparts.
<h2>Warm Weather Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for from a warm weather sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> – One of the main advantages of synthetic sleeping bags is that they do a lot better when they get, but when the weather is warm the chances of getting your sleeping bag wet are generally going to do down, making down insulation the obvious choice for an insulating material.</li>
	<li><strong>Minimum Temperature</strong> – Obviously, you’re not going to need as warm a sleeping bag for warm weather, but you will still need to decide on an exact temperature. A 32 sleeping bag might be ideal for spring, summer and fall in some parts of the world, and only good for summer in others.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Warm Weather Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the best options for a warm weather sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralamina-32-sleeping-bag-synthetic\">Mountain Hardwear Ultralamina 32</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralamina-32-women-s-bag-synthetic\">Women's</a>) - With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong>, the Ultralamina is warm, but not too warm. In many parts of the world it makes an ideal three season sleeping. So not suitable for really warm weather, but good for a variety of conditions. It's a <strong>synthetic sleeping bag</strong>, with a<strong> relatively narrow mummy cut</strong> to help reduce weight. So a good blend of cost saving features like synthetic insulation, as well as weight saving features like the shape. The exact <strong>weight is 1 pound 16 ounces, or 898 grams</strong>, and it also <strong>won the 2007 Gear of the Year award from Outside Magazine</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Highlite</a> - The Highlite is another good warm weather sleeping bag, this one with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>, making it suitable for those warmer nights, though it only has <strong>a half length zipper</strong>, so you don't get to put the zipper down when it gets too hot inside the sleeping bag. But the half length zipper, along with the <strong>850 fill down</strong> helps to cut down on weight, if not the price. And at just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>, it is extremely lightweight, and a great choice for backpackers looking for a summer sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828312/marmot-plasma-40-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +40</a> - For those really warm nights, the Marmot Plasma, with a <strong>minimum temperature of just 40 degrees</strong>, is a great choice. It <strong>uses 900 fill down</strong>, which is a rather impressive quality of down, making it another very lightweight option, though you do end up paying a premium for that higher quality insulation material. The <strong>shell is also coated with a durable water repellent finish</strong>, which is a nice touch if you're going to be exposed to the elements. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 2 ounces, or 530 grams</strong>, so another warmer weather sleeping bag ideal for backpackers and anyone else looking for the best.</li>

More specifically, you will likely want a small tent, as well as a lightweight tent, especially if you are the one that is going to be carrying this portable tent around. But besides how portable a tent is, there are a few other tent related things that you need to decide on before you can be sure which tent is right for you.
<h2>Portable Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing portable tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trekking Pole Supports</strong> – If you want to get really innovative, and if you carry trekking poles, then there are a few tents out there that will work with trekking poles providing the structure, rather than a tent pole. Imagine how much more portable a tent would be if you didn’t have to carry any tent poles with it.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall</strong> – Another good way to cut down on the weight and bulk of a tent is to go with a single wall tent, instead of a more traditional tent where you have an inner tent and a rain fly. As long as you properly ventilate your tent, you <!--more-->wont have any problems with condensation, and you will have cut down on roughly half of the fabric of the tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Portable Tents</h2>
Some of the best portable tent options for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/spitfire-1-tent-1-person-3-season\">Eureka Spitfire 1</a> - The Spitfire is a very portable tent, with <strong>room inside for just one</strong> and a relatively impressive <strong>weight of 2 pounds 12 ounces, or 1.25 kilograms</strong>. It has a fairly unique shape, but plenty of room inside. What's best about the Spitfire, however, is that it's a portable tent with a very low price. So if you want something to take take backpacking or solo camping, but don't want to spend a lot, the Spitfire might be the ideal portable tent for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-meta-2p-tent-2-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Meta 2P</a> - The Meta is another solid portable tent. It's a <strong>single wall design that can also use trekking poles for supports</strong>, which are the two features listed above to look out for, so it has plenty going for it. There's <strong>room inside for two</strong>, and there's also a nice, big vestibule for storing whatever gear you need kept dry at night. Even the interior of the tent is very roomy, at <strong>37 square feet of floor space</strong>. So while you save weight and bulk with the design features, you also don't lack for space in any regard. So a portable but roomy tent, perfect for anyone who uses trekking poles. The whole thing <strong>weighs 2 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.33 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2 Tent</a> - The UL2 is the ideal portable tent for someone who is willing to spend the money to have the best. It's a <strong>free standing tent</strong>, and has a <strong>double wall design</strong>, which might make you think that it's going to be heavier, but at <strong>2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong> it's the lightest tent on this list, even lighter than the 1 person Spitfire above, this being a 2 person tent. It actually <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so definitely an impressive tent, but with a price to match that. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">solo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">3 person</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">4 person</a> version, for whatever you need.</li>

But if you want a cross between a hiking boot and a hiking shoe, a leather hiking shoe is a good choice. It gives you the kind of durability and protection from use and abuse that a boot does, but gives you the weight savings of a shoe over a boot, which can be equally as important over a long day of hiking.
<h2>Leather Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you are wanting leather hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – If you’re looking for leather hiking shoes then you’re probably also looking for some amount of waterproofing. Leather by itself, if properly cared for will keep your feet fairly dry, but it’s a better idea to get a pair of hiking shoes that come with a waterproof liner, like Gore Tex, which will add a bit of redundancy as far as keeping your feet dry goes.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – With leather hiking shoes it’s going to be inevitable that they end up weighing more than most other hiking shoes. But still, a heavy hiking shoe is not a good hiking shoe, and even within the limited selection of leather hiking <!--more-->shoes out there, there are lightweight leather hiking shoes and then heavy shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Leather Hiking Shoes</h2>
A few of the best leather hiking shoes for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807298/ahnu-elkridge-event-cross-training-shoes-mens\">Ahnu Elkridge eVent Cross-Training Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829296/ahnu-montara-ii-waterproof-hiking-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - These shoes from Ahnu have a combination of <strong>hardy full grain leather and synthetic leather on top</strong>, with no mesh in site, to ensure that you get as much protection from the elements possible. That leather outer is combined with an <strong>eVent liner on the inside</strong>, eVent being a waterproof material similar to Gore Tex, though eVent is generally believed to be more breathable, which makes it an ideal material for a waterproof shoe liner. All that in a low cut shoe package. They <strong>weigh 2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, so not the lightest shoes ever, but then you cant expect full grain leather shoes to be all that light.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-footwear-drifter-gtx-hiking-shoe-mens\">Patagonia Footwear Drifter GTX Hiking Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/drifter-gtx-women-s\">Women's</a>) - Another pair of excellent leather hiking shoes, this time from Patagonia. These do have a <strong>bit of mesh, right around the laces</strong>, so depending on whether you want a bit of breathability these may or may not be the right choice for you. <strong>The rest of the upper is leather</strong>, however, and that is complimented by a <strong>Gore Tex liner inside</strong>, to keep your feet nice and dry. Between the leather and the Gore Tex, there isn't much chance of ending up with wet feet. All that is complimented nicely by a Vibram sole. These also weigh slightly less than the Ahnu shoes above, at <strong>2.06 pounds, or 935 grams</strong>.</li>

Which makes sense, because a bear is a big, powerful animal that a lightweight canister wouldn’t stand up to. Still, a relatively <strong>lightweight bear canister</strong> is a useful thing to have, because there can be a couple of pounds of difference between a lightweight bear canister and a heavier bear canisters.
<h2>Lightweight Bear Canister</h2>
What to look for when you want a new lightweight bear canister.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – The bigger your bear canister is, all other things being equal, the heavier it will be. So decide how much room you need to store food, and then buy a lightweight bear canister of about that size. Keep in mind too that you can share a large bear canister between two people, so that you only have to bring one canister.</li>
	<li><strong>Parks Approved</strong> – Many people buy bear canisters specifically because they are required for overnight camping in many national parks with large bear populations. Make sure that the bear canister you plan to buy is approved. All of the above <!--more-->canisters are approved as of this writing, but that can change without notice.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Bear Canister</h2>
Some of the best lightweight bear canister options currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768901/bearvault-bv450-solo-food-container\">BearVault BV450 Solo Food Container</a> - The BV450 is acutally a smaller bear canister, which isn't good if you're going to be backpacking or camping for a whole week, but for just a weekend or something similar, it's ideal. It has a <strong>large lid for getting large pieces of food inside, and is clear</strong>, so that you can locate something visually, rather than digging around for it. It will <strong>hold a total of 7.2 liters</strong>, which is <strong>enough for 3 or maybe 4 days of food</strong>, depending on how much you eat. And it <strong>weighs just 2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>, which is a good weight for a bear canister.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - Another bear canister, this one big enough to carry about a weeks worth of food, with <strong>11.7 liters of storage capacity available</strong>. It does also weigh a fair bit more, however, at <strong>4 pounds 4 ounces, which is 1.92 kilograms</strong>. What is particularly nice about this bear canister is that <strong>it is bright yellow</strong>, so that even if the bear drags your food canister away, you should have relatively little trouble finding it again. But if you want lightweight, there are likely better options available.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\">BearVault BV500 Bear Resistant Food Canister</a> - The BV500 is just slightly smaller than the Bear Keg above, with <strong>11.4 liters of space</strong> available to you, and is considerably lighter, at just <strong>2 pounds 9 ounces, or 1.16 kilograms</strong>. It's actually just a bigger version of the BV450 above, so it has the same wide opening and clear sides, both of which are what help make the BV450 a better option. This one is just bigger, so that one person can go for a week or two people could go out for a weekend. So another excellent lightweight bear canister.</li>

Which is quite a lot of money, but then staying dry when you’re outdoors, especially when it’s cold out, is important. Still, it’s more than possible to find a <strong>cheap rain jacket</strong> that wont empty out your wallet, but will still keep you dry for hours on end through a rain storm. What you need is to know what you’re looking for when you go shopping for a rain jacket, so that you don’t get something that is just cheap.
<h2>Cheap Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a cheap rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Something like Gore Tex 3L Pro is not going to be cheap, but there are other, equally good fabrics, like eVent, that will keep you dry, breath well and leave plenty of money in your wallet. The trick is to find a fabric that wont cost a whole lot, but will do a good job of keeping you dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – Rain jackets often come with all kinds of extras that add to the price tag. Something like a helmet compatible hood, for instance, is nice to have if you do a lot of rock <!--more-->climbing, for example, but otherwise it’s a feature that you don’t need, and that you shouldn’t pay for if you can help it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the best cheap rain jackets for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">Women's</a>) - If you have your heart set on a Gore Tex jacket but don't want to spend a lot, then the Minimalist from Marmot is an ideal compromise. It uses <strong>Gore Tex's 2.5 layer fabric, called Paclite</strong>, which will keep you dry but will also ventilate well. But beyond that it stays true to the Minimalist name. It <strong>has the basics, like pit zips, zippered hand pockets, 1 chest pocket and a drawcord on the hood and hem</strong>, but beyond that there's nothing fancy here. Just a basic Gore Tex rain jacket with a good price, at least compared to other Gore Tex jackets.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796005/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795592/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Torrentshell is likely more what most people have in mind when they think of cheap rain jackets. It's made with <strong>Patagonia's own waterproof material, called H2N0</strong>, which helps to keep the price down low. It's also another jacket that has just the basics, like <strong>pit zips and hand pockets</strong>, but not much else. It's the cheapest rain jacket on this list, and an ideal choice if all you want is something basic to keep you dry.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-2-5-storm-jacket-men-s\">GoLite Pertex 2.5 Storm Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-strom-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - One more <strong>2.5 layer jacket</strong>, this time from GoLite. GoLite is a company dedicated to making lightweight gear, as the name suggests, and this is actually <strong>their lightest waterproof rain jacket</strong>, so an ideal option really for staying dry without carrying around a bulky or heavy rain jacket. It includes <strong>pit zips, a drawcord on the hood plus a drawcord on the hem</strong>, but again what stands out about this cheap rain jacket is the low weight.</li>

Of course, down also tends to be more expensive, and also doesn’t perform quite as well when wet, but for many people, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.
<h2>Down Filled Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when reviewing down filled sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – There is actually a whole range of different downs, which are delineated by the fill number. An 800 fill down sleeping bag, for instance, while good, is not as good as a 900 fill sleeping bag. The 900 fill down will provide more warmth, relative to weight, than the 800 fill down.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Regardless of what insulation you decide to use in your sleeping bag, you need to decide on what shape you want your sleeping bag to be. The obvious advantage of a mummy shaped<!--more--> sleeping bag, of course, is that there’s less of it, and so it will weigh less than a comparable rectangular sleeping bag will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Filled Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best down filled sleeping bags with a few different minimum temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite Sleeping Bag</a> - First up, an excellent down filled sleeping bag<strong> for warmer summer nights</strong>. With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong> it wont be much good for winter, but when it's warm it's an ideal temperature rating. That, combined with extra large baffles, a half length zipper and <strong>high quality 850 fill down</strong> makes it extremely lightweight, at just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>. So an excellent, lightweight summer backpack, ideal for backpackers or anyone else the least bit concerned about weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/830938/sea-to-summit-trek-tki-sleeping-bag\">Sea to Summit Trek TK1 Sleeping Bag</a> - This is a combination of a few different features. First, it uses down, but <strong>650 fill duck down</strong>, which helps to keep the price down as much as possible. It's also a <strong>semi-rectangular shape</strong>, which means it's rectangular with a slight taper, so a fine line between comfort and weight. And with a <strong>weight of 2 pounds 2 ounces, or 963 grams</strong>, and a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong> it's not especially lightweight, but it's certainly not heavy either. A good compromise between weight, comfort and price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neutrino-600-sleeping-bag-800-down\">Rab Neutrino 600 Sleeping Bag</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neutrino-600-sleeping-bag-800-down-women-s\">Women's</a>) - The Neutrino is the kind of sleeping bag you want when the temperature starts dropping down low. With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of just 10 degrees</strong> it's warm enough to keep you sleeping comfortably in the winters of many parts of the world. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, and a fairly narrow mummy cut. It also has features like a draft collar and a draw cord on the hood that are essential for keeping you warm. And at just <strong>2 pounds 8 ounces, or 1.12 kilograms</strong> it's very lightweight, relative to other 10 degree sleeping bags out there.</li>

Fortunately for you, there are plenty of lightweight camping stoves to choose from, regardless of which kind of fuel you prefer to use. There are even a few that wont require you to bring any fuel at all.
<h2>Lightweight Camping Stove</h2>
What to consider when you're buying a lightweight camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Type</strong> – Just about every fuel source has lightweight stoves that will work with it, but some fuel sources are definitely better suited to lightweight design than others. Wood camping stoves, for instance, don’t require any fuel, beyond just what you need to actually get a spark going.</li>
	<li><strong>Alternatives</strong> – Something else to consider when looking for your next camping stove is a camping stove that can use more than one fuel type. A wood camping stove, for instance, is a great piece <!--more-->of equipment, except for those times when there’s no wood around. Having a stove that will burn alcohol as well, plus a little alcohol might really come in handy in that situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Camping Stove</h2>
Some of the best lightweight camping stoves for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768603/snow-peak-litemax-stove\">Snow Peak LiteMax Stove</a> - At just <strong>1.9 ounces, or 53 grams</strong> this is one of the <strong>lightest canister stoves around</strong>. In fact you'll have to worry more about the weight of your fuel with a stove like this. The <strong>average boil time is about 5 minutes 30 seconds</strong>, depending on a whole lot of variables, of course. It's also extremely small, and folds up for easy storage when you're not using it. Just slip it on to your backpack and forget about it until you need it. A really portable, lightweight camping stove ideal for those who like to use canisters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-whisperlite-stove\">MSR WhisperLite Sotve</a> - The Whisperlite is a <strong>white gas stove</strong>, and while it <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>, which is quite a bit more than the LiteMax above, that weight makes it one of the lightest liquid fuel stoves around, and so an excellent choice if you prefer white gas. It <strong>comes with a few convenient extras, like a wind screen</strong>, and has a respectable <strong>boil time of 3.9 minutes</strong>. It also folds up small enough to fit in a lot of pots, which is a convenient storage option. So a very lightweight white gas stove to take camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/junior-stove\">Littlbug Junior Stove</a> - The Junior is a <strong>combination of alcohol stove and wood burning stove</strong>, or any other solid fuel that you can get your hands on. It's <strong>made of stainless steel</strong>, which isn't the lightest material ever, but if you're burning wood, for instance, then you're probably not carrying your fuel with you, so that helps to cut down on the weight quite a bit. Even alcohol is a very lightweight fuel, because you don't need any special containers to carry it. It will <strong>boil water in about 5 minutes</strong>, depending on the fuel and conditions, and <strong>weighs 5.1 ounces, or 144 grams</strong>.</li>

But foam pillows are large, and not very well suited to something like backpacking, where the size of your gear matters. For backpacking, something like an <strong>inflatable backpacking pillow</strong> will do a much better job of keeping you comfortable at night, and then compressing down small in the morning so that you can stuff it in to your backpack and not take up a lot of room.
<h2>Inflatable Backpacking Pillow</h2>
What to consider when buying an inflatable backpacking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Padded</strong> – Sleeping with your head against a straight inflatable surface might be a little difficult. It will often pay to have some sort of padded surface on the pillow. You can always just lay a sweater over top of the pillow, but many inflatable backpacking pillows come with some sort of more comfortable sleeping surface built in.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – You can get just a basic rectangular pillow, but one of the great things about foam is that it conforms to the shape of your head. An inflatable backpacking will not do that, however. Fortunately, some inflatable<!--more--> pillows come shaped, so that your head can find a nice groove on the inflatable pillow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Inflatable Backpacking Pillow</h2>
Some of the very best inflatable backpacking pillows for your next adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763637/rei-self-inflating-travel-pillow\">REI Self-Inflating Travel Pillow</a> - This pillow from REI is a great, <strong>small shaped pillow</strong> ideal for those who want something small. The <strong>exterior is a softer polyester</strong>, so that your head is comfortable. And as the name suggests, the pillow self inflates, while you can quickly deflate it and put it in the included stuff sack for easy storage.  Best of all, the whole thing <strong>weighs just 4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>, which is more than light enough for most people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-fillo-pillow\">NEMO Equipment Fillo Pillow</a> - The Fillo <strong>pillow is pure comfort</strong>. It's a relatively <strong>large, rectangular pillow</strong>, but comes with a <strong>full inch of memory foam built in to the surface</strong>, so that you get that soft, cushioned feel that your pillow at home gives you. Little feautres like a micro-brushed outer surface, for softness, and an <strong>integrated stuff sack</strong> help round out this very comfortable inflatable backpacking pillow. It's not light, however, at <strong>10.8 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - The last, and <strong>lightest inflatable pillow</strong> is from Mont Bell. It's a basic rectangular pillow without much in the way of a soft, brushed surface, though that's easily fixed with a sweater or shirt, though there's nothing that says you have to have a luxuriously soft brushed surface to sleep well. But what's best about this inflatable pillow is the weight. At<strong> just 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong> none of the other pillows above are even close. So if you want a lightweight pillow to take backpacking, this is it.</li>

Many of those supplies you might need anyway, not for a survival situation but just as a course of regular camping usage. Fire starting equipment, for instance, is an essential part of any camping survival kit, but is also something that most campers use day to day, to help them cook their meals. The same can be said of other camping survival essentials, like a knife or medical supplies.
<h2>Camping Survival Supplies</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for camping survival supplies.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Medical Supplies</strong> – One thing that you should definitely include in any collection of camping survival supplies is medical equipment. Survival situations often go hand in hand with accidents or something similar, and the first thing you may find that the first thing you need from your camping survival supplies, in a survival scenario, is medical supplies.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – It’s also a good idea to make your camping survival supplies waterproof. Many things<!--more--> that you might think to include, like fire starting supplies or medical supplies are susceptible to water damage, and will be useless if you get them wet, which might be difficult enough to do in a survival situation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Survival Supplies</h2>
Some of the best camping survival supplies, just in case.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708135/adventure-medical-kits-pocket-survival-pak\">Adventure Medical Kits Pocket Survival Pak</a> - If you want a comprehensive survival kit that is also relatively lightweight - the kind of thing that you can just throw in your backpack and forget about - this is ideal for you. It includes <strong>things to help you get rescued</strong>, like a whistle, <strong>things to help to find your way to help</strong>, like a compass, and <strong>gear to help you find food</strong>, like snare wire and fishing equipment. It also includes a few indispensable items, like duct tape, that are sure to come in handy in a survival situation, and of course some basics for starting a fire. And all for just <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-grylls-ultimate-survival-kit\">Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Kit</a> - This is indeed an ultimate kit, which includes just about anything you might need to be relatively comfortable in the outdoors. Besides the <strong>basics, like signaling, navigation and food catching</strong>, you also get a <strong>few extras, like a survival blanket, an LED, and even a small pocket guide</strong> for what steps you should take in a survival situation, knowledge which you might find extremely useful. It even includes a hand saw, which might be handy for an extended stay in the outdoors. It does <strong>weigh 9.4 ounces, or 266 grams</strong>, so not the lightest survival kit ever.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/ultimate-survival-technologies-deluxe-survival-kit\">Ultimate Survival Technologies Deluxe Survival Kit</a> - Despite the \"Deluxe\" in the name this is just a basic kit with a few items in it. It's <strong>comprised of gear for starting a fire, a signaling mirror and a hand saw</strong>. So it's missing a lot of things that might come in handy, like gear for catching food, but if you could only take a few items with you, those would all be versatile and useful things to have with you. The whole thing <strong>weighs 16 ounces, or 453 grams</strong>.</li>

Memory foam is not often used for sleeping pads, however, in part because it is quite a bit denser than the usual foam, and thus heavier. Memory foam does, however, offer a much more comfortable sleeping surface than regular foam, and if your main concern is comfort, it makes for a very restful night in the outdoors.
<h2>Memory Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look for when you want a memory foam sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Topper</strong> – Just like memory foam mattress toppers for your bed at home, there are memory foam mattress toppers for sleeping pads. By using just a topper you don’t add a needlessly large amount of weight to your sleeping pad, and you get all of the comfort of memory foam, which is the main reason to have a memory foam sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Memory foam being a heavy option, there is potential to save a fair bit of weight with a mummy shaped<!--more--> memory foam sleeping pad. Even if your sleeping pad doesn’t come in a mummy shape, you certainly wont break your memory foam sleeping pad by hacking off a few corners with an exacto knife.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Memory Foam Sleeping Pad</h2>
There aren't too many to choose from, but these are the best memory foam sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/775928/big-agnes-memory-foam-pad-kit\">Big Agnes Memory Foam Pad Kit</a> - This Foam Pad Kit from Big Agnes is <strong>designed to work as a cover for a sleeping pad</strong>, but there's no reason you couldn't just use the foam itself as a sleeping pad. It <strong>weighs 2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.21 kilograms</strong>, however, so it's not the lightest thing in the world, but then memory foam is heavy stuff to begin with. It's <strong>3.5 inches thick</strong>, which will provide a good enough sleeping pad for most people, and a luxurious sleep with a sleeping pad inserted in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-dream-time-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Dream Time Sleeping Pad</a> - The Dream Time is a combination of<strong> 3 inch thick memory foam on top, with an inflatable portion underneath that</strong>, so you end up sleeping on a bed of air and a bed of foam, which might even be more comfortable than your mattress at home. Of course the whole things <strong>weighs 6.6 pounds, or 3 kilograms</strong>, so it's not exactly a lightweight choice, but then for this much comfort you have to expect that it's going to be heavy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sleeping-giant-deluxe-pillow\">Big Agnes Sleeping Giant Deluxe Pillow</a> - If you have a memory foam sleeping pad then there's no reason you should stop there, when you could have a matching memory foam pillow as well. Like the Big Agnes memory foam upgrade kit up above, this is <strong>a 2 inch foam portion which is meant to slip on to an inflatable pillow</strong>, though you can order the insert and inflatable pillow together if you don't already have the pillow. It <strong>weighs just 6.5 ounces, or 184 grams</strong>.</li>

Shoes are fine, even ideal for warm weather where moisture isn’t going to be much of a problem. But for colder, wetter months of the year you’re likely to be better served by <strong>hiking boots for women</strong> or men. Boots do a much better job of keeping your feet dry than shoes do, for one, and are usually quite a bit more durable, and stand up to hard use in bad conditions better.
<h2>Hiking Boots for Women</h2>
What to consider when you want hiking boots for women.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Sometimes you need features like full grain leather outers, and you cant help but get a pair of hiking boots for women that are heavy. But every pound on your feet is equal to about five pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure, so you will end the day with a lot more energy if you choose lightweight hiking boots.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Getting a pair of waterproof hiking boots is a no brainer, but you should definitely put a little thought in to the kind of waterproofing you get. A liner is a good start, for example, but not all liners are made equal, and <!--more-->Gore Tex is usually best. Similarly, a full grain leather outer will help to keep a lot of water out, and adds a welcome bit of redundancy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Boots for Women</h2>
Some of the best options for women wanting hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/zephyr-backpacking-boot-women-s\">Kayland Zephyr Backpack Boots</a> - If you want simple and lightweight, then the Zephyr boots are an ideal choice. At <strong>17.5 ounces, or 500 grams</strong> they're lighter than most hiking shoes, but are boots, and not only that, they're waterproof too. Rather than Gore Tex they <strong>use eVent</strong>, which is similar, but is both lighter and more breathable, and so an excellent choice for those looking to waterproof their boots without getting sweaty feet. They <strong>feature a solid Vibram sole</strong>, and even <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. So a well reviewed and very lightweight pair of women's hiking boots.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/asolo-stynger-gtx-hiking-boot-womens\">Asolo Stynger Gore-Tex Boots</a> - If you would prefer something <strong>a little bigger and more durable</strong>, then the Stynger boots might be the best choice for you. The <strong>upper is a mixture of suede and Cordura nylon</strong>, for good durability, and this is paired with <strong>a Gore Tex liner</strong> to keep out all the water. They're definitely on the heavy side, at <strong>2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>, but then the heavy duty, durable option is never the lightweight option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693986/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-womens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - These are boots for the person who's not concerned in the least about weight, and wants maximum durability. The <strong>upper is full grain leather</strong>, for maximum durability and even some decent protection from water. That is <strong>combined with a full Gore Tex liner</strong>, and between the leather and the Gore Tex you can be reasonably sure your feet are going to stay dry. They also come with a <strong>heavy duty Vibram sole</strong>, for maximum traction on bad terrain. At <strong>3 pounds 5 ounces, or 1.5 kilograms</strong>, you're definitely going to feel them on your feet, but you can rest assured they will last for years too.</li>

And if you are an addict, well then that cup of coffee first thing is really more of a requirement. Either way, you cant take your coffee machine with you camping, so you need a <strong>camping coffee pot</strong>.
<h2>Camping Coffee Pot</h2>
Here is what to look for from a camping coffee pot.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reusable -</strong> Depending on how long you are camping for, you might have to make quite a few pots of coffee, and so whatever option you go for should be reusable, and should require little in the way of cleaning. Generally, the less clean up and work your camping cooking gear requires, the better.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated -</strong> It also often helps if your coffee making gear is integrated in some way with your other equipment. A coffee pot that can double as a pot for your food, for instance, is a<!--more--> lot more useful than a coffee pot that is only good for making coffee. And if your food tastes a little like coffee, is that really such a bad thing?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Pot</h2>
A few of the better camping coffee pots and coffee making devices on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee / Tea Filter</a> - Most people have a pot or mug that is suitable for making coffee in, but no device to actually make the coffee with. The MugMate is an elegant solution to that problem. It's also an award winning solution to that problem, having bagged an <strong>Editor's Choice Gold Award in 2009 from Backpacker magazine</strong>. The MugMate has a couple of tabs that sit on either side of your cup and allow the coffee grinds to soak in to your hot water. The <strong>metal filter material means it is easy to clean</strong>, and best of all it <strong>weighs a mere 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>, and is suitable for tea too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snowpeak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - With this offering from Snowpeak you get <strong>both a french press and a pot that can double as a cooking pot</strong> or mug for other beverages. It also <strong>makes two cups</strong>, so it's ideal if you're not the only coffee drinker in your group. It <strong>weighs 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>, but remember that you're getting both a press and a pot, so that is quite light.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snowpeak Coffee Drip</a> - Another innovative coffee delivery device from Snowpeak is this <strong>coffee drip</strong>. It folds up nice and small when not in use, and when it is in use it <strong>sits on top of your mug and makes your coffee</strong> just like any other coffee drip would. It <strong>weighs 4.9 ounces, or 139 grams</strong>, so not the lightest option, but <strong>if you prefer drip made coffee, it's an elegant solution</strong>.</li>

The problem, however, comes when you try to pack those camping bowls and plates in to your backpack. They are awkwardly shaped and always require a certain level of careful planning to get them in to your backpack without taking up a whole bunch of room. C<strong>ollapsible bowls for camping</strong>, however, are an elegant solution to this problem.
<h2>Collapsible Bowls - Camping</h2>
A few things to look for when looking for collapsible camping bowls.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> As with most camping gear, weight matters, especially if you have to actually load your camping gear in to a backpack, rather than a vehicle. There is no reason to <!--more-->carry a heavy collapsible camping bowl when there are lighter collapsible camping bowls for camping available.</li>
	<li><strong>Size -</strong> Some collapsible camping bowls are fairly small, the reason being that they are too collapsible, and the bigger they get the more unstable they become. Make sure you get a proper sized bowl, so that you don't end up having to eat your meal in stages.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Collapsible Bowls - Camping</h2>
The best of the best when it comes to collapsible camping bowls.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752844/guyot-designs-squishy-bowl-and-cup-set\">Guyot Designs Squishy Bowl</a> - There aren't too many choices when it comes to collapsible bowls, and the Squishy Bowl is a fairly clear winner. It won a <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award back in 2007</strong>. It's actually a set, which includes a <strong>6 oz cup and a 16 oz bowl</strong>. 16 oz isn't huge, but it's not tiny either. The <strong>cup weighs 1.7 ounces, or 48 grams, while the bowl weighs 3.3 ounces, or 93 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/x-bowl\">Sea to Summit X-Bowl</a> - The X-Bowl is a different kind of collapsible. Whereas the Squishy bowl quite literally squishes down, the X-Bowl has <strong>sides that collapse down</strong>, like an accordion, which leave you with a flat sort of frisbee, which is a lot easier to pack than a bowl. The <strong>bowl weighs 2.8 ounces, or 80 grams, and holds 22 ounces of liquid</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Collapsible Camping Bowls</h2>
There are also a few viable alternatives to a collapsing bowl. Most camping plates actually have fairly high sides, and work well as bowls. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-deep-dish-plate\">MSR DeepDish</a>, for instance, is 1.7 inches deep, and would work well as a bowl in most instances.

Sea to Summit also makes a plate with collapsible sides, called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-x-plate-collapsible-plate\">X-plate</a>. If you want a collapsible bowl / plate combo unit, it is ideal."

There are some great hiking hats that will keep you well protected from the sun, as well as a few that will keep you dry as well. And there are even some hiking hats that will help keep the bugs away from you while you are out enjoying the wilderness.
<h2>Hiking Hat</h2>
All the best features to look for from a hiking hat.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sun Protection -</strong> Any good hiking hat should provide you with protection from the sun. There are a few ways that they can do this, such as a big wide brim or with fabric<!--more--> that hangs down to your neck, but some sort of sun protection is important. Related to this, look for hats with a good UPF rating.</li>
	<li><strong>Strap -</strong> Any hiking hat with a wide brim will fly away at the first gust of wind if it isn't securely fastened to your head. A good fit will help, but a strap that can be cinched up to your chin is even better. You can also use that strap to let the hat hang out on your back when you don't want to wear it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Hat</h2>
The very best hiking hats.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721740/tilley-ltm6-airflo-hat\">Tilley LTM6 Airflo Hat</a> - Tilley is a well known name in outdoor hats of all kind, so it's no surprise that they have a few great hiking hats, the Airflo being one of the better ones. It's made with <strong>nylon</strong>, and has the standard wide brim to keep the sun off your face and neck. It also has a <strong>UPF 50+ rating</strong> to help keep the sun off. Unique features include <strong>mesh around the top of the crown to increase ventilation, a hidden pocket for storing a few small valuables, and a bit of foam built in to make sure it floats</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bugsaway-adventure-hat-men-s\">ExOfficio Bugsaway Adventure Hat</a> - The Bugsaway is another wide brimmed hiking hat. It's <strong>nylon</strong>, so it will dry quickly if you get it wet, and also has a <strong>UPF 30+ rating</strong> to help protect you when the sun is out. The stand out feature of the Bugsaway, however, is that it actually helps keep bugs away. It's <strong>treated with something called Insect Shield, an odorless material that repels bugs and biting insects</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-seattle-sombrero\">Outdoor Research Seattle Sombrero</a> - The Seattle Sombrero is another wide brimmed hat that will protect you from the sun, but is better suited to protecting you from the rain. It's fully <strong>covered with Gore-Tex</strong>, so water will drip off of you, but not on you. And because it's Gore-Tex, you will get a small amount of breathability for when you start sweating.</li>

The advantage of carbon over the other popular trekking pole material, aluminum, is that it's quite a bit lighter. Pumping those trekking poles all day can be a little tiring, so having a pair of lightweight trekking poles can make a real difference. The main disadvantage of carbon trekking poles is that they will break, rather than bend.
<h2>Carbon Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look for when reviewing carbon trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adjustable -</strong> Most trekking poles are adjustable, so it's not something that you have to worry about too much, but adjustable is preferable to fixed length, unless you are really looking to save weight. With adjustable length trekking poles you can customize their length to your height, and you will also have a much easier time storing the poles in your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Anti-Shock -</strong> Another feature to look for on your trekking poles is anti-shock. The anti-shock on trekking poles will dampen feedback that you get through the poles in your hand, which <!--more-->can become increasingly annoying over the course of a day, especially if you are using them on a lot of rocky or uneven ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Carbon Trekking Poles</h2>
The very best of the carbon trekking pole market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-distance-zpoles\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles</a> - These are by the <strong>lightest trekking poles of the three listed here, at 9.5 ounces, or 270 grams</strong>. They are also <strong>fixed length</strong>, however, so you will have to determine the optimal length before you end up ordering. They do fold down, however, so they are easy to travel with and will store well in a backpack. They also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so if you want lightweight, you will be hard pressed to find anything better than the Ultra Distance Z-Poles.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-alpine-carbon-cork-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Alpine Carbon Cork Trekking Pole</a> - These trekking poles from Black Diamond are <strong>adjustable</strong>, unlike the Ultra Distances, but they also weigh quite a bit more, at <strong>17 ounces, or 492 grams</strong>. But for that extra weight you do get a couple other nice features, like <strong>plush cork handles for a good grip, and foam below the handles for choking up</strong> when you are going downhill, for instance. Their <strong>usable range is 65 cm to 130 cm</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/812555/leki-carbonlite-aergon-xl-antishock-trekking-poles-pair\">Leki Carbonlite Aergon XL Antishock Trekking Poles</a> - The Aergon XL trekking poles are a fairly basic trekking pole without too many extra features. The one notable exception to that is <strong>anti-shock</strong>, which is a great feature that helps to alleviate some of the feedback coming through the poles and in to your hands. They <strong>weigh 14.2 ounces, or 402 grams, and have a usable range of 65 cm to 135 cm</strong>.</li>

Winter hiking on snow, in snowshoes for instance, can lead to snow blindness on a sunny day, and is a situation where hiking sunglasses are definitely called for. Similarly, hiking along the beach can result in a lot of sun being reflected off the water, and can similarly be damaging to the eyes in high doses. So get the <strong>best hiking sunglasses</strong> to look cool, definitely, but also to protect your eyes.
<h2>Best Hiking Sunglasses</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hiking sunglasses.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Strong Frame -</strong> It's a rough and tough world out there in nature. Well not quite, but you do at least want a pair of glasses that can take a fall without breaking or bending. Fragile<!--more--> things do not mix well with hiking or just about any outdoor activity, and that includes fragile sunglasses.</li>
	<li><strong>Polarization -</strong> Polarized lenses are another feature that you might want to strongly consider for a pair of hiking sunglasses. If you do much snowshoeing, for instance, or if you spend time on the water when you're not on the hiking trail, polarization can make a whole world of difference for cutting down on glare.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Sunglasses Reviews</h2>
Reviews of the very best hiking sunglasses currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/oakley-straight-jacket-sunglasses\">Oakley Straight Jacket Sunglasses</a> - These sunglasses from well known manufacturer Oakley aren't polarized, but they do have a lot of other things going for them. For starters the lenses are ideal for <strong>low light conditions</strong>, meaning you wont have to be taking them on and off as you go from shade to sun and back again under the trees. They also have a <strong>strong composite frame, and Oakley's trademark XYZ Optics</strong> to provide as much clarity as possible.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722629/chilis-bluefin-polarized-sunglasses\">Chili's Bluefin Polarized</a> - These are an ideal pair of hiking sunglasses if you're the kind of person that likes to use and abuse their hiking equipment. They're cheap, at <strong>approximately $20</strong>, so you wont mind breaking or losing them. They're also <strong>polarized</strong> to cut down on glare, and they have a fairly neutral style and look, which means they're good for both men and women.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/maui-jim-hookipa-sunglasses-polarized\">Maui Jim Ho'okipa Sunglasses</a> - A <strong>higher end pair of polarized hiking sunglasses</strong> from Maui Jim. They have a very tough <strong>nylon frame, and polycarbonate lenses</strong> that stand up well to a little use and abuse. Besides that, however, they're also a fairly good looking pair of sunglasses that would work just as well around town as they would on the trail. So if you only want to have to own <strong>one pair of sunglasses for the trail, the town, the beach</strong> and anywhere else you might need sunglasses, these are a great choice.</li>

You might be tempted to take along a bigger knife, but it’s generally not something that you’ll need, and for most purposes a <strong>camping pocket knife</strong> is an ideal choice. Of course there are a few other choices that you need to make when picking out a pocket knife for camping. You need a knife that is going to do everything you need it to do, and ideally without weighing too much, so that it doesn’t make your pants sag.
<h2>Camping Pocket Knife</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a camping pocket knife.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – All other things being equal, you don’t want to be carrying around a big, heavy camping knife unless you’re really going to need a big heavy knife. A small camping pocket knife will do just about everything that you might need a knife for in the outdoors, and wont add unnecessary weight to your gear load.</li>
	<li><strong>Serrated</strong> – A versatile camping pocket knife is the best knife, and a serrated section on the blade makes for a much <!--more-->more versatile knife. You will have a much easier time cutting through rope and cord, for instance, which is a common enough task for campers to have to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pocket Knife</h2>
Some of the very best camping pocket knives for your next camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/826733/baladeo-34g-superlight-pocket-knife\">Baladeo 34G Superlight Pocket Knife</a> - If you want something small and minimal, then this pocket knife by Baladeo is perfect. At <strong>just 1.2 ounces or 34 grams</strong>, as the name suggests, you'll hardly even know that you're carrying it. But with a <strong>3.75 inch blade</strong> it's not tiny, and it even comes with a <strong>handy belt clip</strong> so that it's always right where you need it. So the perfect camping pocket knife for someone who wants something small and lightweight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-paraframe-i-serrated-edge-knife\">Gerber Paraframe I Serrated Edge Knife</a> - The Paraframe is a little bigger and more substantial than the Baladeo knife above, but still definitely qualifies as relatively lightweight, at just <strong>2.6 ounces, or 73 grams</strong>. It has a <strong>3 inch blade</strong> when it's open, plus a <strong>belt clip and serrated section</strong> on the knife to maximize your cutting options. So a well made but relatively lightweight pocket knife to take camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/470-emissary\">Benchmade 470 Emissary</a> - Benchmade is known for using quality stainless steel for their knives, and the 470 Emissary is a perfect example of that, <strong>using premium steel to ensure that the 3 inch blade is as good as possible</strong>. High quality steel costs more, however, and the price of this knife is quite a bit higher than those of the other two knives above. Besides that, the knife has the basics, such as <strong>a belt clip, and an impressive weight of just 2.2 ounces, or 62 grams</strong>, thanks in part to the aluminum alloy handle. So not cheap, but if you want the best camping pocket knife possible, this is one of the best.</li>

But there are certainly some big, heavy bivy sacks out there that will rival the weight of smaller tents, and so it helps to look for a <strong>lightweight bivy sack</strong>, and not just assume that your bivy sack is going to be lightweight. That way, you get all the advantages of using a bivy sack, without sacrificing weight.
<h2>Lightweight Bivy Sack</h2>
What you want to pay attention to when you want a lightweight bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Supported</strong> – Many bivy sacks come with poles that make the bivy sack in to a very small tent, which certainly does have a few benefits, such as increasing air flow. But all that extra material, not to mention the poles, adds to the weight of the bivy sack, and if you want a lightweight bivy sack it’s best to avoid those structured bivy sacks.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The material that your bivy sack is made out of will also help determine just how lightweight it is. Something like Gore Tex is a good <!--more-->fabric for a bivy, because it breathes but is also waterproof, but Gore Tex is also heavy. So pay attention to the fabric that bivy sacks are made out of if you want a lightweight bivy.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightweight Bivy Sack</h2>
Some of the very best lightweight bivy sacks to take on your next backpacking or camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-lite-bivi\">Rab Alpine Lite Bivi</a> - The Alpine Lite Bivi is exactly the kind of gear you want when taking a bivi sack in to alpine conditions, as the name suggests. The <strong>top of the bivy is very breathable eVent fabric</strong>, which is waterproof, similar to Gore Tex, but the main thing being that it is very breathable, to allow moisture to escape. That is complimented by a <strong>completely waterproof bathtub floor</strong>, and a <strong>U-shaped opening along the top edge of the bivy</strong>, so that there is no face opening for rain or snow to pelt you in the face through. And all for a <strong>weight of just 15 ounces, or 420 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-e-bivy\">MSR E-Bivy</a> - The <strong>top of the E-Bivy is a silicon coated nylon</strong>, while the <strong>bottom is a heavier duty</strong>. So while it would be generous to call the E-Bivy waterproof, it will do a decent job of keeping you dry in light moisture, and being nylon, will breath very well, so at least you wont get wet from the inside. It has an <strong>overlapping face opening</strong>, so that you can be protected from the elements while still getting lots of air circulation. And at<strong> just 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong> it's light enough that you'll hardly even know you're carrying it. So maybe not waterproof, but an ideal bivy sack for good weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Brand/Terra_Nova/Bivi_bags/Ultra_Bivi_Bag.html\">Terra Nova Ultra Bivi</a> - At just <strong>2 ounces, or 50 grams</strong>, the Ultra is the lightest bivy sack on the market. It's even <strong>waterproof, but unfortunately not breathable</strong>, so if you're not careful you will end up getting wet from your own generated condensation. It also has a <strong>fully exposed face opening</strong>, so if it starts raining or snowing there is at least one part of you that is going to be getting wet. Still, you cant beat the weight of the Ultra. The price, however, is also extreme, so if you're not looking to spend a lot, this might not be the lightweight bivy sack for you.</li>

But there are actually quite a few other options available, like a bivy sack, or a hammock. <strong>Hammocks for camping</strong> have a few advantages over the average tent. For one, curling up in a hammock can be a lot more comfortable than inside a tent on a sleeping pad. A hammock also gets you up off the ground, and makes it so that you don’t have to worry about things like ground water.
<h2>Hammocks for Camping</h2>
What to consider when you're reviewing hammocks for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tarp</strong> – Unless you can be sure that it’s not going to rain while your camping, one accessory that you’re likely to need for your camping hammock is a tarp. Some hammocks will come in a package with a tarp, but many don’t, and so you should make sure that you’re either getting a hammock with a tarp, or else get a tarp to go along with your hammock.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Proof</strong> – A tarp will protect you from the rain, but not from the bugs. Some hammocks come with a bug proof roof built in, so that you stay protected from the bugs at night, and can get a good sleep, but some don’t. You can always <!--more-->wear a bug net to bed, of course, but many hammocks come with a bug net ceiling built in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hammocks for Camping</h2>
Some of the very best hammocks to take camping with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/moskito-traveller-hammock\">Byer of Maine Moskito Traveller Hammock</a> - This is an ideal hammock to take along for a little casual camping, especially if you're not expecting any rain. It's a full hammock with a <strong>maximum weight of 250 pounds</strong>, and importantly, <strong>a built in mosquito net</strong>, to keep you bite free while you sleep. What it doesn't come with is a tarp, to keep you dry, or a hanging system, though Byer of Maine does make ropes, called <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721723/byer-amazonas-microrope\">MicroRopes</a>, that work well with this hammock. So a good basic model for taking camping with you. It <strong>weighs 1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-singlenest-hammock\">Eagles Nest Outfitters SingleNest Hammock</a> - The SingleNest is <strong>just a hammock, nothing else</strong>. You're not protected from bugs, rain, and it also doesn't come with ropes for hanging. So an ideal hammock if you want to buy the rest of the gear you will need separately, or else if you already have some of that gear. One nice thing about the SingleNest is that it <strong>will hold 400 pounds</strong>, which is considerably more than most hammocks, which typically go up to 250 pounds. It <strong>weighs 18 ounce, which is 510 grams</strong>, and there's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-doublenest-hammock-egn0002\">two person version</a> available.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight Asym Classic Hammock</a> - The Explorer is what you want if you want to be fully protected from the elements and the bugs, and you don't want to have to shop around. The hammock itself <strong>will hold 250 pounds, and has a built in bug net on the top</strong>, to keep mosquitoes and everything else at bay. It <strong>also comes with a rain fly that works well with the rest of the hammock, and ropes</strong> so that you can properly hang the hammock. So a great package of everything you need to get started with hammock camping.</li>

But a <strong>fleece jacket with hood</strong> will do an even better job of keeping you warm. The reason is that a lot of your warmth when you’re outside is lost from your head. It takes a lot of heat to keep that brain inside running properly. So if you want to get warm, it’s a good idea to trap all that heat that’s escaping from your head, and direct it back at you. That’s why a fleece jacket with a hood is such a useful piece of gear to have.
<h2>Fleece Jacket with Hood</h2>
What to consider when you want a fleece jacket with hood.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – A hood will definitely help keep your head warm, but the thickness of the fleece itself will also determine, to a large extent, how warm you stay. 100 weight fleece, for instance, will keep the chill off, but 300 weight fleece will leave you warm and toasty inside you jacket.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Just like the thickness of the fleece jacket, a hardened exterior will also do a lot to keep you warm. Fleece jackets often come with hardened outer surfaces to<!--more--> help deflect wind. So if you don’t want to lose all kinds of heat to the wind chill, a hardened outer surface on your fleece jacket is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Fleece Jacket with Hood</h2>
Some of the best fleece jackets with a hood for men as well as women.
<h3><strong>Men's Fleece Jacket with Hood</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815134/rei-rauk-jacket-mens\">REI Rauk Jacket</a> - The Rauk is less athletically cut than the R1 below, and is <strong>ideal for around town, though is certainly has a few features that make it suitable for life in the outdoors</strong>. One is the hood, obviously, but another is the <strong>hardened outer surface, which makes it more resistant to both wind and moisture</strong>, two things that you're likely to experience frequently in the outdoors. There's no word on the weight of the fleece, but it's likely 100, or maybe 200 weight fleece, so ideal for cool temperatures, but not extremely cold, at least not without a few more layers. It also comes with a couple of zippered hand pockets and thumb holes on either sleeve.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - The R1 is <strong>ideal for those who like to be active</strong>. It is <strong>100 weight fleece</strong>, but has tiny channels cut in to the inside, so that it will breath as much as possible, so that you stay warm when you're staying active, without sweating. It has a hood, plus <strong>a zippered chest pocket and a couple of thumb holes</strong> on either sleeve and an extra long length, with <strong>an athletic cut</strong>, which makes it perfect for layering. The ideal hooded fleece jacket for being active in the outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Fleece Jacket with Hood</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799347/the-north-face-windwall-2-fleece-jacket-womens\">The North Face WindWall 2 Fleece Jacket</a> - The WindWall 2 is a solid fleece jacket for when the temperatures start to dip down. It uses <strong>200 weight fleece</strong>, to keep you warm, plus a <strong>hardened outer surface to keep the wind and rain at bay</strong> as best as possible. The hood is joined by a couple of zippered chest pockets, so that you can keep all your extremities warm. It doesn't have an especially athletic cut, however, so it's equally suitable for around town. So a very versatile hooded fleece jacket for cold temperatures.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-shadow-hooded-fleece-jacket-womens\">Rab Shadow Hooded Fleece Jacket</a> - The Shadow is a lighter fleece jacket than the WindWall above, as it uses <strong>100 weight fleece</strong>, which will keep you warm but will also allow you to breath, and not get too overheated when you're staying active. The hood also has a small opening, to keep in as much warmth as possible, and a <strong>couple of zippered hand pockets and thumb holes in the sleeves</strong>, all designed to keep you as warm as possible. So an ideal fleece jacket for going out and being active in.</li>

There are plenty of different choices to make when picking out a sleeping bag, and even when you decide on what you want, it can be daunting to really look through the hundreds of potential different options that are out there. Which is why a <strong>sleeping bag comparison</strong> is one really excellent way to help you find the perfect sleeping bag for you. If nothing else, it helps to really demonstrate what the differences are between various sleeping bags.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Comparison</h2>
What to consider when you want to do a sleeping bag comparison.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – If it wasn’t already obvious, one good way to cut down the potential sleeping bags to choose from is to look at the temperature ratings. If you spend some time looking at the kind of temperatures that you will be out in, you will get a good idea of exactly what kind of minimum temperature you want on your sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Weight is an important characteristic to compare when looking at sleeping bags, especially if you will be carrying that sleeping bag over long distances, but it’s <!--more-->not determined by any one thing. Rather, a wide variety of variables, such as the shape of the sleeping bag or the material used to insulate the sleeping bag contribute to the weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the best sleeping bags, based on the above criteria for comparison.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralamina-45-sleeping-bag-synthetic\">Mountain Hardwear Ultralamina 45</a> - If you just need a sleeping bag to keep the chill off on warm summer nights then the Ultralamina 45 might be an ideal choice. As the name suggests the <strong>minimum temperature rating is 45 degrees</strong>, which is at the cooler end of the spectrum when it comes to sleeping bags. It's also uses <strong>synthetic insulation, and a mummy shape</strong>, and <strong>weighs just 1 pound 9 ounces, or 708 grams</strong>, which is relatively light, though not when you compare it to many other down sleeping bags. But still, a solid warm weather sleeping bag with an attractive price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-megalite-sleeping-bag-30-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering MegaLite</a> - The MegaLite is, as the name suggests, a sleeping bag designed to be lightweight. With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 30 degrees</strong> and a <strong>weight of 1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>, it's both warmer and lighter than the Ultralamina above, which gives you some idea of what an improvement down is over synthetic insulation. The MegaLite uses <strong>high quality 850 fill down, plus a mummy shape</strong> to save you as much room as possible. So an ideal three season sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/830941/sea-to-summit-trek-tkii-sleeping-bag\">Sea to Summit Trek TkII</a> - When things get a little colder you need a sleeping bag that can provide you with more warmth. The <strong>18 degree minimum temperature rating</strong> of the Trek TkII is ideal for four season camping in many parts of the world. It's also a <strong>semi-rectangular sleeping bag</strong>, so you have a little more room to move around inside. It also <strong>uses 650 fill duck down</strong>, not goose down,  which keeps you warm and the weight down, without raising the price too much. At <strong>2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, the TkII isn't the lightest sleeping bag at that temperature rating, but it's a good blend of a few different features that increase comfort without increasing price too much.</li>

A tent will keep you dry, after all, but one of the more important things that a tent also does is keep bugs out. If you are slightly worried about rain, incidentally, many people use a tarp of some sort in combination with a mosquito tent, which is a lightweight package that will both keep the bugs off and keep the rain away too, should it start showering a bit.
<h2>Mosquito Tent</h2>
What to consider when you want a mosquito tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Structure</strong> – Some mosquito net tents work just like any other tent, with poles and plenty of room inside. But there are also much smaller mosquito tents that look more like a bivy sack, or and even some mosquito tents that work with a tarp set up where you use a trekking pole or something similar for support.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – One of the big advantages of using a mosquito net tent instead of a full tent is that you save quite a bit of weight. But even amongst mosquito tents, there is quite a bit of difference<!--more--> in the various weights, and unless you want to end up carrying a big, heavy mosquito tent, it helps to pay attention to weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best mosquito tent</h2>
Some of the very best mosquito tents to keep the bugs at bay.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mega-bug\">Black Diamond Mega Bug</a> - The Mega Bug is a perfect <strong>getaway for 2 people</strong> looking to escape from the bugs. It's a simple mesh exterior with a waterproof floor that also doubles as an interior tent when combined with a tarp, which Black Diamond also sells. The whole thing is <strong>supported by a single aluminum pole in the center</strong>, which is made more stable with the guyouts along the edge of the tent. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 13 ounces, or 822 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-mesh-bivy\">Marmot Mesh Bivy</a> - If you'd prefer a mosquito tent for just yourself, then a <strong>bivy style tent</strong> is ideal. The mesh is <strong>supported above your head by a single looped pole</strong>, so that bugs are kept at bay. Of course something like this is ideal for combining with a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">tarp tent</a>, so that you are protected from the bugs and the rain too. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 3 ounces, or 538 grams</strong>. So just enough of a shelter to get you away from the bugs while you get some sleep, without adding much weight to your overall load.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798576/sea-to-summit-mosquito-pyramid-insect-shield-net-single\">Sea to Summit Mosquito Pyramid Insect Shield</a> - The Pyramid is similar to the Mega Bug above, but rather than a pole to support the mesh around you there is <strong>just a convenient hanging spot, so that you hang the entire mesh structure from something overhead</strong>. If there's a tree around that will work, but if you don't mind getting a little creative you could also use a trekking pole, or even a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">tarp tent</a>. Whatever system works best for you. This is a <strong>single person size</strong>, but there's also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798575/sea-to-summit-mosquito-pyramid-insect-shield-net-double\">two person size</a>. This smaller one <strong>weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, making it by far the lightest option on this list.</li>

Particularly if you are carrying around a heavy load, <strong>hiking trekking poles</strong> are a crucial piece of gear to have with you. They allow you take some of the weight off of your knees, which is often a joint that suffers with hikers and backpackers. Hiking trekking poles can also increase stability, and even provide a stable platform for taking pictures. A very versatile piece of equipment.
<h2>Hiking Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look at when you're reviewing hiking trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When considering hiking trekking poles you have two choices for material, which are aluminum and carbon fiber. Aluminum is heavier, but also quite a bit cheaper. Carbon is lighter and more expensive, and also a little more brittle and prone to breaking in lower temperatures.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed or Adjustable</strong> – Most trekking poles are telescoping, which allows you to fine tune the length so that it’s just right for you. But there are a few pairs of fixed length trekking <!--more-->poles out there. The main benefit of using fixed length trekking poles is that they tend to weigh less than the adjustable kind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Trekking Poles</h2>
Some of the best hiking trekking poles for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784270/rei-traverse-trekking-poles-pair\">REI Traverse Trekking Poles</a> - If you would prefer <strong>something cheap and basic</strong> for trekking poles, REI's in house brand is usually fairly reliable. These are a basic pair of telescoping trekking poles, meaning they're <strong>an adjustable length</strong>. They're <strong>made with aluminum</strong>, and have soft foam on the handles for maximum comfort, but there's nothing fancy here. They <strong>weigh 19.1 ounces or 541 grams</strong> for the pair, they're unisex, but the most attractive thing about these trekking poles is definitely the price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> - The Ultra Distance poles are a step in the complete opposite direction from the basic REI poles above. First, <strong>they're fixed length</strong>, and fold like tent poles do, rather than telescope down like most trekking poles. So that means you need to pick the right size for you, because you cant adjust them. They're also <strong>carbon fiber</strong>, to help save on weight, and at <strong>just 9.5 ounces, or 269 grams</strong> for the large size, they're lighter than just about anything else out there on the market. They also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and really are an excellent choice if you want lightweight trekking poles to take hiking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/corklite-aergon-speedlock-anti-shock\">Leki Corklite Aergon Speedlock Anti-Shock</a> - If you want solid trekking poles with all the bells and whistles, these from Leki are a good choice. They have the <strong>nice cork handles</strong> that some of the higher end trekking poles feature, for maximum comfort over hours of use. They also have <strong>anti-shock built in</strong>, which again maximizes your comfort when you're using them for hours on end. They're <strong>made with aluminum</strong>, are adjustable, and <strong>weigh in at 18.6 ounces, or 527 grams</strong>.</li>

Finding <strong>cheap sleeping bags</strong> helps, and finding sales and discounts helps even more, but if you don't know much about sleeping bags, you might not have a good idea of what to look for.

So here are a few things to look for which will tend to bring down the cost of a sleeping bag.
<h2>Cheap Sleeping Bags</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Synthetic Insulation -</strong> Down is a fantastic insulating material for sleeping bags for a few different reasons, but down, and especially high quality down, tends to cost more than synthetic insulating materials. This isn't always true, and if you manage to find a cheap down sleeping bag that's a great find, but if you want a cheap sleeping bag, chances are you are looking for synthetic. The one upside is that synthetic insulation is better than down when wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Heavy -</strong> Generally, cheaper sleeping bags tend to be heavier sleeping bags. Again, there are some exceptions<!--more-->, which I will cover below, but if you want a cheap sleeping bag you are probably not getting as light a sleeping bag as possible. Part of this is that synthetic insulation, discussed above, is heavier than down.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Sleeping Bags</h2>
Here are a few of the best cheap sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-spiral-burrow-bag-5-synthetic\">Mont Bell Super Spiral  Burrow Bag</a> - Mont Bell makes some really great down sleeping bags, and they include a lot of the features from those bags in this synthetic sleeping bag for a package that is both <strong>lightweight and inexpensive</strong>. It weigh a very reasonable <strong>31 ounces, which is 878 grams, and for that you stay warm down to 40 degrees</strong>, which is an ideal temperature rating for <strong>summer camping or backpacking</strong> in most parts of the world. The price you get will vary depending on the retailer, but <strong>should be in the $100 to $150 range</strong>, which is a great price for such a lightweight sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/809128/rei-lumen-40-sleeping-bag\">REI Lumens +40 Sleeping Bag</a> - This is another <strong>summer sleeping bag</strong> that is good down to <strong>36 degree temperatures</strong>. It's made by REI, and <strong>costs between $120 and $130</strong> as of this writing. It's another synthetic sleeping bag, so it is going to weigh a bit more, but this is offset by the mummy shape, so at least you save on fabric. The precise weight is <strong>32 ounces, or 900 grams</strong>, so it is slightly heavier than the Mont Bell above, but you get a slightly better temperature rating and a slightly better price for that extra weight, so a reasonable trade-off.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-aleutian-bx-sleeping-bag-20-degree-heatshield\">The North Face Aleutian Bx Sleeping Bag</a> - If you are looking for something with a lower temperature rating, that would be suitable for some <strong>spring, fall or even mild winter camping</strong>, the North Face Aleutian will be a good choice for the budget conscious. <strong>It's good down to 20 degrees</strong>, which is an ideal temperature rating for a lot of off-season camping and backpacking. It does <strong>weigh 3.45 pounds, or 1545 grams</strong>, however, so not the lightest sleeping bag in the world. But the saving grace is the price, which is <strong>just under $100, which makes this a great bargain</strong>.</li>

And if you can bring some with you that's great, but to safely drink the water that's already out there, you will need a <strong>hiking water filter</strong>. A water filter will get rid of all the bad stuff in the water, making it more or less safe to drink.
<h2>Hiking Water Filter</h2>
What to look for from hiking water filters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> If you are going to be carrying a water filter with you in the outdoors, it might as well be a lightweight water filter. Some of them can get rather heavy, but there is no real reason to carry something heavy, when there is a perfectly good lightweight option.</li>
	<li><strong>Method of Filtration -</strong> You might think that pumping is the only way to get water through a filter, but you <!--more-->would be wrong. There are other methods of filtration, and even alternatives to filtering altogether.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Water Filter</h2>
Recommendations on the best hiking water filter.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-hyperflow-microfilter\">MSR HyperFlow Microfilter</a> - The HyperFlow <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and has gone through some improvements since then to make it even better. It will <strong>pump three liters of water per minute</strong>, and will go a total of <strong>1000 liters before the filter needs replacing. It also weighs just 7.8 ounces, or 221 grams</strong>, which is more than light enough for most people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-works-filter\">Platypus Gravity Works Filter</a> - This water filter from Platypus is a good example of something a little different. Rather than using your hard work on the pump to get water, this filter <strong>uses gravity</strong> to get the water through the filter. It gives you <strong>1.75 liters of water per minute</strong>, and will go for <strong>1501 liters before the filter needs replacing</strong>. It does weigh a bit more, however, at <strong>10.7 ounces, or 304 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720265/katadyn-hiker-pro-water-filter\">Katadyn Hiker PRO Water Filter</a> - The Hiker PRO is another pump filter. It weighs a little more than the comparable HyperFlow above, at <strong>11 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>, but it also gets top marks for being easy to clean, while the HyperFlow is sometimes criticized as being difficult to clean in the field. It also only <strong>pumps 1 liter per minute</strong>, and the filter needs to be <strong>replaced every 750 liters</strong>, so it does fall short in a few other areas as well. Still, it's a very popular pump water filter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Hiking Water Filters</h2>
Water filters are not the only way to make your water drinkable. If your water is already reasonably clear, and all you're concerned about is the things you cant see lurking inside your water bottle, then a water purifier might be the answer. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a>, for instance, uses a blast of UV light to instantly kill just about everything lurking in your water. No pumping or waiting, just clean water instantly.

You might be able to get by with your everyday underwear for backpacking, but if you don't want to have to haul along a different pair for every day, or if you are looking to cut down on chaffing and odors, then what you need is a good pair of backpacking underwear.
<h2>Backpacking Underwear</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for backpacking underwear.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fit</strong> - For women, not much changes as far as fit goes for switching from everyday underwear to backpacking underwear, but for men who are used to a loose fitting boxer shorts kind of underwear, a few changes are in order, the main one being that you should be going for a tight fit, especially in the thighs, which helps to avoid chaffing.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabric</strong> - Another important criteria for selecting backpacking underwear is the fabric. You definitely do not <!--more-->want to go with something like cotton. There are many excellent fabrics available with all kinds of features, like antimicrobial coatings to cut down on smell, that are available when buying underwear for backpacking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Underwear</h2>
The best backpacking underwear, broken down for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Backpacking Underwear</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/boxer-brief-w-fly-150-men-s\">Icebreaker Boxer Brief</a> - Wool probably isn't the first material that most people think of when they think of backpacking underwear, but wool is actually a great choice for a few different reasons. First, it is <strong>naturally antimicrobial</strong>, meaning you wont smell nearly as bad after a long day of backpacking. <strong>Wool also feels great against the skin</strong>, and is a natural material, which will be a definite plus for some people. Finally, Icebreaker does wool garments extremely well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/694431/exofficio-give-n-go-boxer-briefs-mens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs</a> - On the other hand there is a <strong>synthetic option</strong> from ExOfficio. These are similar in size and fit to the Icebreakers, but are made of a <strong>combination of nylon and spandex for a nice, stretchy fit</strong>. They <strong>breath well, dry quickly and have an antimicrobial coating</strong> so that just like with the wool, your boxers will smell fresh at the end of the day. Best of all, they're <strong>half the price of the Icebreakers</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Backpacking Underwear</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-merino-boy-boxer-womens\">Stoic Merino Boy Boxer</a> - A <strong>boxer brief fit for women</strong>. This pair of backpacking boxers from Stoic are <strong>merino wool</strong>, which is actually an excellent material for this kind of garment. <strong>Wool breathes well, dries quickly and best of all, is a natural antimicrobial</strong>, so you will smell as fresh at the end of the day as you did when it began.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795155/exofficio-give-n-go-string-bikini-briefs-womens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go String Bikini Briefs</a> - Very similar to the ExOfficio boxers found above in the men's category, but with a woman's fit. They're made of a <strong>blend of nylon and spandex</strong>, which feels good against the skin and provides an excellent fit, and are <strong>treated with an antimicrobial coating</strong>, so that you will smell fresh at the end of the day. The nylon also wicks moisture extremely well and dries quickly, which is ideal when you are being active.</li>

The big caveat with hammocks is that you need trees, or something like trees to rig your hammock to. Provided you have a few solid objects to tie your hammock to, however, you are fine. At least until it starts raining, which is where a <strong>hammock tent</strong> comes in. A hammock by itself is fine, but a hammock with an overhead fly is definitely better. It will keep you dry, and will also help to cut down on your exposure to things like bugs.
<h2>Hammock Tent</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hammock tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bug Protection</strong> - Just like a regular tent, it is nice if your hammock tent protects you from bugs which will otherwise eat you alive at night. A good alternative to a full bug netted <!--more-->hammock, however, is a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-insect-shield-mosquito-head-net\">bug net for your face</a> which, in combination with a zipped up sleeping bag, will keep the bugs at bay.</li>
	<li><strong>Hammock Sized</strong> - Many people use rectangular tarps for camping under when sleeping on the ground, and while you may be able to make such a tarp work for you, a tarp sized for a hammock, with a wide middle and narrower ends, will better protect you from bad weather and will also help to save on weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hammock Tent</h2>
A few of the better hammock tents that you will find on the market today.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hammock-bliss-no-see-um-no-more-hammock\">Hammock Bliss No-See-Um Hammock</a> - If you're not worried about getting wet, or if you already have a rain fly for your hammock, then what you need is a <strong>hammock with built in no-see-um netting</strong>. The integrated design ensures that you wont have to deal with any bugs at night, which is a definite plus when sleeping outdoors. This particular model weighs <strong>28 ounces, or 793 grams, and will hold up to 350 pounds</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight</a> - If you are looking for the <strong>whole package, including hammock, rain fly and suspension system</strong>, this option from Hennessy is ideal. You actually enter the Explorer from the bottom, which then closes behind you with velcro, meaning that there are no zippers or other weak spots where bugs might get in. The whole system weighs <strong>38 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>, so not the lightest hammock, but keep in mind that you are getting everything you need in one package. It also <strong>holds up to 250 pounds</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dry-fly-rain-tarp\">Eagle's Nest Outfitters Dry Fly Rain Tarp</a> - If you already <strong>have the hammock and just need the tarp</strong>, then this is a great choice from Eagle's Nest Outfitters. It's big enough to cover your hammock and your gear too, and is the ideal shape for use with a hammock. It <strong>weighs 22 ounces, or 623 grams</strong>.</li>

Though there are many unisex backpacks on the market, there are also many excellent <strong>hiking backpacks for women</strong>, that are built for a woman's frame. Buying a gender specific backpack will give you a better chance of finding the right fit, which will allow you to stay comfortable over a long period of hiking. One of the more important differences between men's and women's backpacks, however, is the size. You should only carry a certain percentage of your own weight, and women being smaller, should be carrying a load proportional to their size.
<h2>Hiking Backpacks for Women</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for women's backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> - Women being smaller than men, should be carrying a lighter, smaller load than men. A woman's sleeping bag, for instance, will tend to be smaller than a man's sleeping <!--more-->bag, which will help to make the load smaller. It's recommended that you carry a certain percentage of your weight too, so 30% percent of a 180 pound man will be a lot more than 30% of a 120 pound woman.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - To help lighten the load, you should be looking for lightweight sleeping bags. There's no reason to carry a heavy backpack, after all, when you could be carrying a lightweight backpack instead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Backpacks for Women</h2>
A few of the better backpacks designed with women in mind.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824384/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-ki-pack-womens\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60 Ki</a> - The Blaze A.C. 60 <strong>won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2011</strong>, and is a great backpack to take hiking, camping or anywhere else. It's lightweight, at <strong>2.8 pounds, or 1.3 kilograms</strong>, and will hold <strong>60 liters</strong> of gear. It's lidless, to help cut down on weight, and also does not have a sleeping bag compartment. It does, however, have a hydration sleeve for easy access to a water bladder, as well as a few exterior pockets for storing a few essentials.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peak-pack-unisex\">GoLite Peak Pack</a> - This is one is a <strong>unisex</strong> pack that will work equally well for both men and women. You have <strong>three different size options</strong>, so you can get the size of backpack that is appropriate for you. It also weighs quite a bit less, at <strong>1.6 pounds, or 737 grams</strong>, but only has room for <strong>36 liters</strong> of gear. It also <strong>lacks a frame</strong>, so you wont want to carry anything beyond 25 or 30 pounds, but you likely wont need anymore than that if you plan right.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-xenon-85-backpack-womens-4700-5100cu-in\">Osprey Xenon 85 Backpack</a> - At the other end of the scale there is the Xenon, which offers a full <strong>85 liters</strong>, which is enough room to pack just about anything. You get plenty of features with a backpack like this, including a detachable day pack, multiple access points to the main pocket and plenty of external pockets as well. The price for all that, however, is weight. The Xenon weighs <strong>6.3 pounds, or 2.8 kilograms</strong>, so definitely not a lightweight option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - Another <strong>unisex option</strong>, this time from ULA Equipment. You have <strong>four length options to choose from, however, as well as four hip belt options</strong>, so you even though it's unisex, you will likely get a better fit, provided you are willing to do a little work and measure yourself. And with <strong>68 liters</strong> of capacity for gear at just <strong>36 ounces, or 1 kilogram of weight</strong>, it's a great option for those looking to save on weight.</li>

They take a lot of weight off of your knees and distribute it in to your arms and shoulders, allowing your body to better handle a heavy load and lots of ups and downs on the trail. But some trekking poles can get rather heavy, having the unintended consequence of tiring out your arms. But with <strong>ultralight trekking poles</strong>, you can have all of the advantages of trekking poles without any of those drawbacks.
<h2>Ultralight Trekking Poles</h2>
Features that you want to see when shopping for ultralight trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Carbon</strong> - There are two basic materials that trekking poles come in, which are carbon and aluminum. Carbon is the lighter of the two, and though it has a few drawbacks, like being more expensive and more prone to breaking, you should be looking at carbon trekking poles if you want ultralight trekking poles.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed Length</strong> - Adjustable poles are definitely nice to have, but if you really want to save on weight, there is no <!--more-->better way to do that then with fixed length trekking poles. All that extra material that comes on adjustable trekking poles, after all, does weigh quite a bit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Trekking Poles</h2>
A few of the best ultralight trekking poles, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles</a> - If you need the best and lightest, the Ultra Distance Z-Poles are an excellent choice. They weigh a very slim <strong>9.5 ounces, or 270 grams</strong>, and <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award</strong>. They're <strong>fixed length</strong>, but come in a number of different sizes, so you can find the best pair for you. They're also <strong>carbon</strong>, rather than aluminum, and do <strong>break down in to smaller sections</strong> for stuffing in to your backpack when not in use.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/trekking/lt3c-trekking-poles.html\">Gossamer Gear LT3C Trekking Poles</a> - Another extremely ultralight trekking pole option. These particular poles are c<strong>arbon, and weigh just 5.5 ounces, or 158 grams</strong>. They also come in several different sizes, for different heights. The only real drawback of these poles is that they are a <strong>true fixed length, in that they don't break down</strong>, so a little more difficult to travel with. But still, you cant beat the weight of these trekking poles.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813390/black-diamond-distance-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\">Black Diamond Distance Z-Poles</a> - If carbon just does not appeal to you, and you would be more comfortable with <strong>aluminum</strong>, then these are an excellent option from Black Diamond. They're similar to the Ultra Distance poles above, besides the material. Like the carbon version <strong>they break down in to separate sections</strong>. The aluminum, however, weighs quite a bit more, at <strong>12.3 ounces, or 350 grams</strong>.</li>

They are lightweight, easy to replace, and fool proof to use. They don't do so well in winter, or at higher elevations, but for general use for three seasons camping, they are an ideal choice for campers.
<h2>Camping Stoves - Propane</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for a new propane camping stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - There's no sense in carrying a heavy camping stove when you could be carrying a lightweight camping stove instead. Putting aside the fuel and its weight, there are many extremely lightweight propane camping stoves on the market. For many of them, you will hardly even realize that you are carrying them.</li>
	<li><strong>Time to Boil</strong> - An important metric when it comes to camping stoves is how long it takes for the stove to boil <!--more-->your water. This number will change, based on how much water you are boiling, what kind of pot you are using and even what the weather is like, but still, no one wants to wait forever for water to boil.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Stoves - Propane</h2>
A few of the very best propane camping stoves out there on the market.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/crux-lite-stove\">Optimus Crux Lite Stove</a> - A great little propane camping stove, the Crux Lite weighs in at just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 72 grams</strong>. It will bring <strong>1 liter of water to a boil in 3 minutes</strong>, given average conditions, which is a fairly impressive time. It doesn't fold, which wont help to save on bulk, but the not folding is part of what helps it to weigh so little.</li>

The difference in weights between the Crux the this stove are fairly negligible, however this one needs a full 52 seconds more to produce a boil, with a <strong>boil time of 3 minutes, 52 seconds</strong>. This stove did, however, <strong>win the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award</strong>, so you know it's an excellent product.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-litemax-stove\">Snow Peak LiteMax Stove</a> - The <strong>lightest stove on this list, at just 1.9 ounces, or 54 grams</strong>, the LiteMax is an excellent choice for those looking to save every gram possible. No boil time is advertised, but with as many positive reviews as this stove receives from customers, it wont be high.</li>

For those that like to venture off of the trail and in to the back country, a compass might be relied on for navigation, and used quite a bit. A compass might also be a survival item, or a just-in-case item that you can pull out if something goes wrong. Whatever you plan to use your compass for, the <strong>best compass for hiking</strong> will, at a minimum, give you the basic information of where you are, and where you should be going.
<h2>Best Compass for Hiking</h2>
Things you should be looking for when reviewing compasses for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Declination Adjustment</strong> - You adjust declination on a compass to compensate for the difference between true north and magnetic north, which is the north that a compass is attuned to. If you're pulling your compass out because something has gone wrong, and you need to know where north is, declination likely wont be a priority for you, but if you are using your compass for navigation, you should definitely be taking declination in to account.</li>
	<li><strong>Sighting Mirror</strong> - For navigating with a compass, a sighting mirror is an important tool to have to make your job easier. A sighting mirror allows you to see the <!--more-->compass needle and the horizon at the same time, so you can fix your direction of travel on a geographic feature or something similar with relative ease.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Compass for Hiking Reviews</h2>
The very best compasses for hiking, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787189/suunto-mc-2-pro-compass\">Suunto MC-2 Pro Compass</a> - The MC-2 is a great, middle of the road compass. It has has all the basic, essential features for real navigation, like a <strong>sighting mirror and adjustable declination</strong>, but does not cost an exorbitant amount. It also comes with an <strong>adjustable lanyard</strong> so you can hang the compass on your neck, where you have easy and quick access to it. The MC-2 <strong>weighs 2.65 ounces, or 75 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-8099-pro-compass\">Brunton 8099 Pro Compass</a> - The 8099 is a top of the line compass, <strong>for serious navigation</strong>. It has the basics, including a <strong>sighting mirror and an adjustable declination, as well as a few expert features</strong>, like three clinometer systems and a bubble level, for reading the slope of various geographical features. If you want to do some serious navigating, this is a good choice. It <strong>weighs 3.6 ounces, or 3.6 ounces, or 102 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tag-a-long-w-thermometer\">Brunton Tag-a-long</a> - If you don't plan on doing any navigating, and just want <strong>something you can pull out in an emergency</strong>, then the Tag-a-long is ideal. It's just a <strong>basic bubble compass</strong> that will point north for you. It also comes with a <strong>thermometer</strong>, which might be useful in a survival situation, and comes on a handy key chain ring, so you can attach it to a backpack or jacket and forget about it. It <strong>weighs .7 ounces, or 20 grams</strong>, light enough that you will forget you're carrying it until you need it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>A Good Map</h2>
It must be said that a compass isn't of much use if you don't have a good map to go along with it. If you plan on navigating, it also helps to have up to date information on what the declination adjustments are for the area you are hiking in.

If you don't plan to do any navigating, and just want a compass as an emergency measure, then you should at least familiarize yourself with the area you are hiking in, and where you could go, should you get in to trouble. Features like mountains are easy to orientate yourself with, and major roads will generally be hard to miss, and will be good places to get help. Knowing where these things are in your hiking area is good knowledge to have before you set out."

There are plastic alternatives, or course, but if you want your camping plate to really last, metal is an ideal choice.
<h2>Metal Camping Plates</h2>
What to look for when you are shopping for a new metal camping plate.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - You've narrowed your choice down to metal, but there are still quite a few different metals that you can choose from. Stainless steel is strong, but heavy, and aluminum is lightweight, but not particularly strong. Titanium is both lightweight and<!--more--> relatively strong, but also quite expensive.</li>
	<li><strong>High Sides</strong> - When camping, you're rarely lucky enough to be eating off of a flat surface, like a table. More likely, you will find yourself eating out of your lap, or something similar, in which case it pays to have high sides on your camping plate, to keep the food where it's supposed to be, and not all over you or the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Metal Camping Plates</h2>
A few of the very best metal camping plates, in a few different material choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-trek-titanium-plate\">Snow Peak Trek Titanium Plate</a> - First, a great choice of plate from Snow Peak. It's <strong>titanium</strong>, so it doesn't weigh much, at just <strong>2 ounces, or 56 grams</strong>. It's also a good size, with a <strong>7.5 inch diameter</strong>, making it an ideal choice of metal camping plate for those who want to save on weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-plate\">MSR Alpine Plate</a> - Another <strong>7.5 inch diameter</strong> camping plate, this time made of <strong>stainless steel</strong>. Because of the stainless steel this plates weighs a bit more, at <strong>4.4 ounces, or 126 grams</strong>. It will be strong though, and this particular plate has especially high sides too, which will come in handy if you're the kind of person that likes to load up a plate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401061/aluminum-dinner-plate-9-inch\">Aluminum Dinner Plate</a> - And finally, a basic <strong>aluminum camping plate</strong>. It has a <strong>9 inch diameter</strong>, so larger than the other two plates, but the sides are only .6 inches high, so not a very significant lip there. But it <strong>weighs just 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, so quite lightweight, especially when you consider that it's larger than the other two plates listed.</li>

In summer, a sleeping pad keeps you comfortable, and in winter a sleeping pad keeps you both comfortable and warm, something that you should not be relying entirely on your sleeping bag for. But the <strong>best backpacking sleeping pad</strong> will do all this and will do it without weighing a lot, because you have to remember that when you're backpacking, you have to carry everything you're taking with you, and you might as well be carrying a lightweight backpacking sleeping pad.
<h2>Best Backpacking Sleeping Pad</h2>
Features to look for when you are picking out your next backpacking sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - Sleeping pads come in a few different shapes, the two most distinctive being mummy shaped, where the sleeping pad is full width at your hips and shoulders, and tapered everywhere else, and rectangular, which is self-explanatory. Mummy <!--more-->shaped saves on weight, definitely, but if you're a restless sleeper, you might find it too small for you.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> - Another important feature of sleeping pads to be aware of is R-value. You can read plenty more about <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">R-value</a>, but basically the higher the R-value is, the warmer your sleeping pad will be. That is, the more heat it will reflect back up at your, rather than letting that heat seep in to the ground.</li>
	<li><strong>Padding Type</strong> - There are also a couple of choices when it comes to the kind of padding you want, those being inflatable or foam sleeping pads. Foam is more durable, you cant really break foam, but foam also tends to be a little harder than inflatable sleeping pads.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backpacking Sleeping Pad Reviews</h2>
A selection of a few of the very best backpacking sleeping pads on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped Downmat Sleeping Pad</a> - First up, a backpacking sleeping pad with one of the <strong>best R-values, at 8</strong>, that you will find. If you plan on doing any <strong>winter camping</strong>, this is an ideal sleeping pad. It will also do well in the summer, though it will be heavier than most other summer sleeping pads. It's <strong>rectangular, and actually has a layer of down built in to it</strong>, which helps with adding warmth. It <strong>weighs 2.2 pounds, which is 1.02 kilograms</strong>, which is very lightweight when compared to sleeping pads with a comparable R-value.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is one of the best backpacking sleeping pads for summer, and certainly one of the most popular. It's <strong>inflatable, and rectangular</strong>, which might make you think that it's heavy, but it actually weighs a very <strong>lightweight 14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>. It's <strong>R-value is 2.5</strong>, which is ideal for summer camping, and it <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's good.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-3-4.html\">Gossamer Gear Nightlight</a> - If your chief concern is weight, then foam is a good choice, and a sleeping pad like this one, that's only <strong>3/4 length</strong>, is even better. You let your feet or head or a bit of both hang off, and end of saving on weight. The Nightlight <strong>weighs 12.3 ounces, or 350 grams</strong>, and is <strong>3/4 of an inch thick</strong>, with an egg crate design for added comfort. It rolls up well, and you can stick it on the exterior of your backpack and not be worried about damaging it.</li>

But even the best waterproof boots have one important flaw, which is that they cant do anything about water coming in down the top of the boot, between the boot and your leg. Which is where <strong>waterproof gaiters</strong> come in, sealing off that area where water might penetrate. A good waterproof gaiter will also help protect your boots from water and damage from being banged up against rocks and other debris from the trail. For certain conditions, like walking through water soaked brush, waterproof gaiters can be a crucial piece of outdoor gear.
<h2>Waterproof Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you’re looking at waterproof gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Many materials are claimed to be waterproof, but in reality will just keep you dry for a limited amount of time or limited amount of water, after which you will get wet. So pay <!--more-->attention to the material you are getting. Gore-Tex is always a good choice, but certainly not the only one available.</li>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Gaiters come in all different lengths, but if your objective is to keep your feet dry, you will be better served by high gaiters that come up to somewhere close to the knee. That way, your whole lower leg is protected, and it will be very difficult for any water to find its way down in to your boot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Gaiters</h2>
A few of the better waterproof gaiters currently on the market.
<h3><strong>Men's Waterproof Gaiters</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769562/mountain-hardwear-ascent-stretch-air-permeable-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Ascent Stretch Gaiters</a> - First, a great pair of gaiters from Mountain Hardwear. The <strong>uppers on these are constructed with a tough, treated nylon</strong>, to both keep water out and allow some air in.The <strong>lower portion is made of a tougher, more durable nylon</strong> to stand up to plenty of abrasion and help protect your boots. They get up to about the <strong>mid-calf</strong>, and are a good choice for a waterproof gaiter.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - When it comes to waterproof gaiters, these are an extremely popular choice. The <strong>upper portion is constructed with a very durable Gore-Tex</strong>, so that you stay dry and your legs can breath a little, and it reaches about the <strong>mid calf</strong>. The <strong>lower portion is cordura and heavy duty pack cloth</strong>, to protect your boots from all sorts of abuse. These gaiters <strong>won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold Award way back in 1999</strong>, and they've only gotten better with time.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Waterproof Gaiters</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/769562/mountain-hardwear-ascent-stretch-air-permeable-gaiters\">Mountain Hardwear Ascent Stretch Gaiters</a> - The same basic waterproof gaiter as the one described in the men's gaiters above. They use a <strong>treated nylon for waterproofing</strong>, and are a solid choice as a gaiter for wet conditions. These are actually <strong>a unisex gaiter, but they come in several different sizes</strong>, the smaller sizes being more appropriate for women.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - Very similar to the men's version described above, but not quite the same. These have the same waterproofing, with a <strong>very durable Gore-Tex for the uppers</strong>. Where they differ is a few areas, including the color scheme and very likely the <strong>length, to accommodate women's shorter legs</strong>.</li>

For one, something that you need to think about when picking out a camping knife is the weight of the knife itself. Remember that unless you’re car camping you will have to carry that knife around, and a chunk of metal can get heavy quickly. A lightweight camping knife may not be quite as strong as something bigger and heavier, but a lighter option will likely be better for the overall camping experience.
<h2>Best Knife for Camping</h2>
Features to consider when shopping for a knife for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Folding or Fixed</strong> – There are two main kinds of knives that you can take camping. Fixed blades are the kind that usually come in a sheath, and are made of one solid piece of metal. They’re strong, being all one piece, but also tend to be relatively heavy. Folding knives, on the other hand, are usually lighter and smaller, but also weaker, because of the folding joint.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Remember that you’re carrying a chunk of metal around with you, and that can <!--more-->get heavy after awhile. If weight is a concern, and it should be if you’re carrying your camping gear, then it can pay off, in terms of how your back and legs feel at the end of a day on the trail, to carry a small, lightweight knife as opposed to a big, heavy one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Knife for Camping Reviews</h2>
A few of the best knives for taking camping with you in the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816234/gerber-bear-grylls-ultimate-knife\">Gerber Bear Grylls Ultimate Knife</a> - You might be put off by the Bear Grylls promotion, but Gerber makes solid knives that are ideal for taking camping. This is a solid <strong>fixed blade knife with 4.8 inches of blade</strong> to work with. Besides the knife itself you <strong>get a whistle on a lanyard, a diamond sharpener built in to the sheath, and a  ferrocerium fire starter, also in the sheath</strong>. The whole unit <strong>weighs 14.7 ounces, or 416 grams</strong>, so not even close to lightweight, but if you're interested in the survival aspect, it's a great knife. Incidentally, if all you're looking for is a fixed blade knife, the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\">Big Rock</a>, also by Gerber, is an excellent choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/34-gram-pocket-knife-black-titanium\">Baladeo 34 Gram Pocket Knife</a> - At the complete other end of the spectrum from the Bear Grylls knife is this <strong>folding knife</strong> from Baladeo which, as the name suggests, <strong>weighs just 1.2 ounces, or 34 grams</strong>. The <strong>blade is actually quite long, at 3.6 inches</strong>. Part of the blade is also serrated, to give you cutting options. It's <strong>made of steel and coated with titanium</strong>, so you get both strength and light, an ideal combination.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-paraframe-i-serrated-edge-knife\">Gerber Paraframe I Serrated Edge Knife</a> - Another <strong>folding knife</strong>, this one a bit bigger and heavier to stand up to more wear and tear. It's still relatively lightweight, at <strong>2.6 ounces, or 73 grams, and has a full 3 inch blade</strong>. Just like the Baladeo, a portion of the blade is serrated, so that you can get through materials like rope with relative ease. <strong>Not as lightweight as the Baladeo, but likely quite a bit stronger</strong>.</li>

The three heaviest things that backpackers tend to carry are called the big three, and consist of the sleeping bag, the backpack itself, and of course the tent. A good <strong>backpacking tent</strong>, then, should be lightweight. You don’t want to be lugging around a big, heavy tent, because your knees and back will certainly not thank you at the end of the day, and you will also run out of room in your backpack, necessitating a bigger backpack.
<h2>Backpacking Tent</h2>
What to look for when you’re looking for a backpacking tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – As stated above, you really want a lightweight tent if you’re going to be carrying it in a backpack. Related to this, a lightweight tent will also tend to be smaller and more compact, which takes up less room in your backpack, and means you don’t need a big, oversized backpack either.</li>
	<li><strong>Trekking Pole Supports</strong> – One thing that you should always be on the lookout for when it comes to backpacking equipment is dual<!--more--> use items. Many people use trekking poles, for instance, but once you get to camp there’s not much use for them. There are many tents, however, that will allow you to use trekking poles in places of tent poles, allowing you to leave tent poles at home. Not for everyone, but a feature definitely worth considering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Tent</h2>
A select few of the very best backpacking tents that you could hope to get your hands on.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - First up, a lightweight option that gives you the <strong>option of using trekking poles as supports</strong>, as described above. Tarptent isn't a brand that you will find over at REI or the like, but they make excellent, lightweight tents that have a loyal following in the lightweight backpacking community. The Contrail is a <strong>single wall design with plenty of ventilation</strong>, intended for <strong>1 sleeper</strong>. It weighs very little, at <strong>24.5 ounces, which is 696 grams</strong>. If you're willing to try something a little different that will save you a lot of weight, the Contrail is an ideal choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2</a> - In the more traditional dome tent category is the Fly Creek line from Big Agnes. The UL2 has room for <strong>two sleepers, and at 33.8 ounces, or 960 grams</strong>, it's one of the most lightweight dome tents you'll find.

Nature is full of interesting animals and impressive vistas. But sometimes seeing everything from a trail is a little difficult, given the distances involved. Sometimes, with a bear, for instance, you would feel a lot better if you never got close enough to see up close, and you had to rely on something like binoculars. Whatever the case, the <strong>best binoculars for hiking</strong> will give you plenty of amazing views without making you trek all over the place.
<h2>Best Binoculars for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a new pair of binoculars to take hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bi or Mono</strong> – Most people default to binoculars when looking for magnification for hiking, but there are actually many excellent monoculars available that do an excellent job of magnifying what is distant, albeit for just one of your eyes. The upside is that a monocular weighs roughly half of what a pair of binoculars does.</li>
	<li><strong>Magnification</strong> – You also need to decide on just how powerful a pair of binoculars you want. Higher magnification can be nice to have, but then binoculars with <!--more-->better magnification also tend to be heavier and more delicate, a combination which tends to not mix very well with outdoor pursuits like hiking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Binocular Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the better binoculars that you could take hiking with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-echo-zoom-monocular-10-30x21.html\">Brunton Echo Zoom Monocular</a> - First up, a <strong>monocular</strong>, which is a magnifier for one eye, just like a scope. It does anywhere from <strong>10x to 30x zoom</strong>, which is quite respectable, and since it's just one eye, it weighs comparatively little, at <strong>3.2 ounces, which is 91 grams</strong>. It's not going to give you quite the same experience that a pair of binoculars would, but then it also weighs quite a bit less. And while it's<strong> not a waterproof unit it's at least small enough to slip in to a pocket</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/744595/nikon-trailblazer-atb-waterproof-8-x-25-binoculars\">Nikon Trailblazer ATB</a> - These make a great compact, basic pair of binoculars to take hiking, camping or backpacking. They do <strong>8x zoom, and are waterproof</strong>, which is always a nice feature to have when it comes to hiking equipment. They're fairly lightweight too, at <strong>9.9 ounces, or 280 grams</strong>. They're basic, but sometimes that's all you need.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721658/nikon-eagleview-zoom-8-24-x-25-compact-binoculars\">Nikon Eagleview Zoom</a> - The Eagleviews are something a little more complex, but also from Nikon. They do <strong>zoom anywhere from 8x to 24x</strong>, though they may not be everyone's first choice to take hiking, since they're <strong>not waterproof</strong>. They do make up for this, however, by coming with a <strong>leather case, which provides a bit of a classic touch and also some protection from the elements</strong>. If you want something a little more powerful, these could be the hiking binoculars for you.</li>

Many people go in to the outdoors to get away from technology, but even those people would agree that taking a basic watch that at least tells the time is a necessity. <strong>Hiking watches for men</strong> and women do a lot more than just tell the time, however. Many also double as compasses, altimeters, barometers and more. They can tell you quite a lot about the world around you, and used properly, can be an indispensible piece of equipment for travel in the outdoors.
<h2>Hiking Watches for Men</h2>
What to be on the lookout for when shopping for a hiking watch.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – Hiking watches are rarely just a way to tell time. As alluded to above, they often come with a whole variety of extras such as digital compasses, altimeters, barometers and more. They can tell you quite a lot about the world around you, and can be extremely<!--more--> useful tools to have in all kinds of different situations.</li>
	<li><strong>Backlight</strong> – You would likely find it difficult to find a hiking watch that didn’t have a backlight, but even so, it’s worth pointing out that if you want to be able to use your watch at night without a flashlight, you need a backlight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Watches for Men</h2>
Some of the better hiking watches for men, across a few different price points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/timex/expedition-trail-series-digital-compass-watch-full-size\">Timex Expedition Compass Watch</a> - First, something basic from Timex. The one major feature that comes on this watch is a <strong>digital compass, and of course a backlight</strong>. Beyond that it's just a way to tell the time that has a few basic features, like an alarm, that just about any digital watch comes with. Of course the price reflects this lack of features, so <strong>if you're not looking to spend too much, this is a good choice</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778410/casio-pathfinder-paw1500-1v-multifunction-watch\">Casio Pathfinder Multifunction Watch</a> - If what you're looking for is features, and lots of them, the Pathfinder is a great choice. It's <strong>solar powered</strong> first of all, so as long as you get some daylight you'll never run out of batteries. It also <strong>receives atomic clock updates</strong>, so even if you lose power due to lack of sunlight, you wont have to guess at the time when it comes back alive. Beyond that it has a <strong>digital compass, altimeter, barometer and thermometer</strong> to tell you everything you might want to know about the environment around you. <strong>A great hiking watch with plenty of features to play with</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-vector-altimeter-watch.html\">Suunto Vector Altimeter Watch</a> - The Vector is a feature rich watch with a price that isn't too extreme, like the Pathfinder. It has an <strong>altimeter, barometer, thermometer and compass</strong>, making it a useful piece of technology for knowing what the environment is doing around you. It's a great compromise if what you want is a <strong>high quality watch but you don't want to spend an overly large amount</strong> to get it.</li>

The <strong>best person locator beacons</strong> are impressive pieces of technology that will get help to you in just about any location, no matter how remote. When you’re by yourself and you want a little peace of mind, or even if your family and friends want a little peace of mind, a personal locator beacon is an ideal way to provide it.
<h2>Best Personal Locator Beacon</h2>
Features that you might want to look for on your next personal locator beacon.
<ul>
	<li><strong>I’m OK</strong> – Some of the higher quality personal locator beacons allow you to send “I’m OK” messages to friends and family at home. You can often include GPS data with the message, so that they can pinpoint where you are. It’s a nice feature that provides a little peace of mind to people at home, which is often what taking along a personal locator beacon is all about.</li>
	<li><strong>Test Mode</strong> – Something else that you may want to have on your personal locator beacon is a test mode. PLBs<!--more--> are well designed and constructed, because they wouldn’t be much use if they were continually breaking. But even so, when you’re depending on a device in case of emergency, it helps to be able to test it, so that you know it’s working properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Personal Locator Beacon Reviews</h2>
A few of the best person locator beacons, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/acr-sarlink-view-406-personal-locator-beacon.html\">ACR SARLink View 406</a> - If you're looking for the very best personal locator beacon, it will be hard to beat the View 406. You can <strong>send \"I'm OK\" messages that include GPS data</strong>, so that friends and family can know you're okay and can track your progress. There's also a <strong>test mode</strong>, so you know the device is working, and a <strong>digital display for crucial information</strong> like frequencies and remaining battery life. It also uses the <strong>subscription free Search and Rescue satellite</strong>, and finally, has a <strong>strobe light</strong> that automatically gets activated when the device is triggered, so that rescuers can more easily find you. The whole thing <strong>weighs 8.9 ounces, or 258 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791972/mcmurdo-fast-find-210-personal-locator-beacon-with-gps\">McMurdo Fast Find 210</a> - If you don't like the high price of the ACR unit above, something like the Fast Find may be better. It <strong>doesn't have the ability to send \"I'm OK\" messages, but does have a test mode</strong>. And it does the crucial job of alerting rescuers, via the <strong>subscription free Search and Rescue satellite</strong>, where you are. It also has an <strong>LED light that can be manually activated to blink</strong>, which wont be as bright as a strobe light but will definitely assist rescuers in finding you. So not many extras on this personal locator beacon, but it does the most important job, and costs relatively little. The whole thing <strong>weighs 5.3 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gps-satellite-messenger\">SPOT GPS Satellite Messenger</a> - The SPOT is not like your traditional personal locator beacon. It uses a <strong>subscription service, which is $99 per year</strong>, and not the free Search and Rescue satellite, which most other personal locator beacons use. Beyond that it has the ability to <strong>send \"I'm OK\" messages and GPS data</strong>, which will give friends and family some peace of mind. The unit <strong>weighs 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams</strong>.</li>

Women’s and <strong>men’s soft shell jackets</strong> are so great because, while they’re not really the best at any one thing, they are quite good at a number of things. They insulate well, they also cut the wind well, and most will also keep you dry, up to a point. So while a soft shell jacket might be the wrong jacket in a rain storm or a wind storm, it’s a great jacket to grab in the morning when you don’t know what the day holds for you.
<h2>Men’s Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for your next soft shell jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Though many soft shell jackets are not water resistant, or at least not treated with any kind of water resistant product, it’s a great feature to have on a soft shell jacket. If you have a soft shell jacket that is at least water resistant you can leave your rain jacket at home, saving room and weight in your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – One of the greatest things about a soft shell jacket is that it is versatile, and when it comes to keeping you warm in a variety of weather conditions, there are<!--more--> few things more versatile than a hood. Your head is one of the areas where you lose the most body heat, and a hood gives you the ability to keep that body heat in when you’re cold, and let it out when you’re hot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
A select few of the better men's soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/788626/arcteryx-gamma-mx-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Gamma MX Jacket</a> - The Gamma is one of several excellent soft shell jackets made by Arc'teryx. First, it has a <strong>durable water repellent (DWR) finish</strong>, to give it some water resistance, and a total of <strong>5 zippered pockets</strong>, 2 for the hands, 2 on either breast and 1 on the arm. The full length zipper and high collar mean you can vary just how warm it is too, making it great for a wide variety of conditions. The price is high, but this is a high quality soft shell jacket. It <strong>weighs 18 ounces, or 510 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-leadville-softshell-jacket-mens.html\">Marmot Leadville Softshell Jacket</a> - Another soft shell jacket with a design similar to that of the Gamma MX above. Gore Windstopper fabric makes the jacket both <strong>wind and water resistant</strong>, and a high collar and full length zipper make it suitable for a wide variety of weather conditions. It comes with <strong>3 zippered pockets</strong>, 2 for the hands and 1 on the breast. It's very similar to the Gamma MX above, but just about half the price, making it a great value choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/boreas-pull-on-men-s\">Rab Boreas Pull-On</a> - <strong>Winner of the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, the Rab Boreas is a fantastic choice for a soft shell jacket. First, it's a <strong>pull on, with a half length zipper. It also has a hood</strong>, something that neither of the other jackets have, which can help add warmth when the temperature drops. What it doesn't have is any sort of waterproofing or water resistance, something the other two jackets above do have. But the award, along with the price, which is half that of the Leadville and a quarter of what the Gamma MX is, make it an attractive choice if you don't plan on getting wet. It <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 300 grams</strong>.</li>

You also very likely spend a good amount of time walking from here to there. And if your feet aren’t happy while you’re out and about, the rest of you isn’t going to be having much fun either. Which is why a good pair of <strong>camping socks</strong> is so important. Ideally more than one pair, but there are a few pairs that you could wear for days on end without noticing much dirt or smell.
<h2>Camping Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for camping socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – First and foremost, you need to decide on a material for your socks. And while there are a few exotic choices available to you, like bamboo, the first and best choice is always going to be wool. It regulates body temperature well, wicks away moisture and is also a natural antimicrobial, so after a long day of hiking your socks will smell just as good as they did at the start.</li>
	<li><strong>Fitted</strong> – A simple tube sock is always the cheaper choice, but a more expensive fitted sock definitely has a few positives on its side. For one, a fitted sock tends to<!--more--> feel better over a long day of being inside a shoes. Fitted socks also tend to crease and wrinkle a lot less, creases and wrinkles being on the common causes of blisters and hot spots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Socks</h2>
A few of the best camping socks to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-mens-tko0055\">Teko Merino Midweight Hiking Sock</a> - First, a great pair of <strong>midweight camping socks</strong> from Teko. They're made with high quality <strong>merino wool</strong>, as the name suggests, and have a number of great features, including <strong>extra padding on the bottom, extra ventilation on the top of the sock and a fitted shape throughout</strong>. A really fantastic camping sock if you're looking for something midweight. There's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-midweight-hiking-sock-womens-tko0006.html\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/phd-outdoor-light-crew-sock-men-s\">Smartwool PhD Outdoor Light Crew Sock</a> - Another camping, this a light one from Smartwool, which are well known for making excellent wool products. These particular socks are <strong>fitted, and offer a bit of extra cushion on the bottom where it counts, and Smartwool's 4 way fit system</strong>, to keep your socks in place at all times. Another fantastic pair of wool camping socks. There's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/phd-outdoor-light-crew-sock-women-s\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/711809/injinji-tetratsok-mini-crew-toesocks\">Injinji Tetratsok Mini Crew</a> - You may or may not have seen these before, but they're the <strong>socks with individual toes</strong>. Far from a novelty, there is actually an excellent reason for those individualized toes, which is that it <strong>eliminates the blisters that many people experience from having their toes rub together</strong>, particularly when putting in big miles on the hiking trail. They also wick moisture very well, and are an all around great sock, putting the unique toe design aside. Worth looking at, especially if you get blisters on your toes. They're also <strong>unisex, so no women's version</strong>.</li>

And if this works for you, that’s great, but just know that there are some wonderful pairs of camping underwear out there that solve a lot of the problems, like chaffing, that most people experience when they try to use regular old underwear while camping, which can make your camping experience a lot more enjoyable.
<h2>Camping Underwear</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for new camping underwear.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a couple of different choices that you have when it comes to the material for your camping underwear. Wool is an obvious one, though this is not the same scratchy sweater wool that most people are familiar with. Wool wicks moisture well, and helps to regulate temperature, both important features in a pair of camping underwear.</li>
	<li><strong>Antimicrobial</strong> – One of the big advantages of going with wool for your camping underwear is that it is a natural <!--more-->antimicrobial, meaning that at the end of the day it will smell just about as good as it did at the beginning. There are, however, several excellent synthetic camping underwear choices that come treated with antimicrobials.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Underwear</h2>
Some of the better choices when it comes to camping underwear, broken down by gender.
<h3><strong>Men's Camping Underwear</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/694431/exofficio-give-n-go-boxer-briefs-mens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go Boxer Briefs</a> - First up, a good, solid pair of camping boxers from ExOfficio. They're a <strong>blend of nylon and spandex</strong> and have a <strong>tight fit, to help eliminate chaffing</strong>. The nylon helps them to <strong>dry extremely fast</strong>, and the spandex helps give them a good stretch, for different leg sizes. Best of all, they have an <strong>antimicrobial treatment</strong>, so you will smell great at the end of the day.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/icebreaker-bodyfit-150-boxer-brief-w-fly-mens\">Icebreaker BodyFit 150 Boxer Briefs</a> - These are fairly similar in design to the Give-N-Go Boxers above, but they're <strong>made of wool</strong>. This isn't thick scratchy wool, however, and you will find it easy to go a whole day wearing these. Wool is a natural material of course, and <strong>breathes very well</strong>, a trait always welcome in underwear you're going to be active in. Wool is also a <strong>natural anti-microbial</strong>, which helps to cut down on smell if you have to wear the same pair for more than a day while out camping.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Camping Underwear</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795155/exofficio-give-n-go-string-bikini-briefs-womens\">ExOfficio Give-N-Go String Bikini Briefs</a> - Similar to the Give-N-Go boxers above for men, but with a woman's cut. They're a <strong>combination of nylon and spandex, for a quick drying, stretchy fit</strong>. They're also treated with an <strong>anti-microbial</strong>, so that they don't retain smells, making them ideal for being active outside for an entire day in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/stoic-merino-boy-boxer-womens\">Stoic Merino Boy Boxer</a> - These are reminiscent of a <strong>boy's boxer cut</strong>, for added comfort in the outdoors. They're also made with a <strong>high quality wool</strong> that feels surprisingly great against the skin. Wool, especially the higher quality stuff, <strong>breathes very well</strong>, which is always a bonus in the outdoors. Wool is also a <strong>natural anti-microbial</strong>, which means the boxers wont retain smells.</li>

You may want some sunscreen and a pair of hiking sunglasses to go along with your hat, of course, but the hat is important, because sun screen only does so much.
<h2>Hiking Hats for Men</h2>
Features to try and find on your next hiking hat.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Wide Brim</strong> – One of the defining characteristics of the hiking hat is the wide brim that encircles the entire hat. This brim is not just for show, it serves a valuable purpose, which is to keep the sun off of your face and neck. It also helps to keep you dry if you get a few showers.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Another important choice that you have to make when picking out a hiking hat is the material. Nylon is an obvious choice, as it does well as sun protection, and dries well from exposure<!--more--> to either rain or sweat. Gore Tex is another good choice if you’re more interested in protection from the rain.</li>
</ul>

Cold, stiff fingers can be a real danger, and the last thing you want is to get in to camp and then to have your fingers be so stiff that you cant even set up your tent, to get warm, or your stove, to get dinner going. Even a simple, thin pair of <strong>backpacking gloves</strong> can do quite a bit to keep your hands, if not toasty warm, then at least warm enough so that they’re still useful to you around camp.
<h2>Backpacking Gloves</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for backpacking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Reinforced Palms</strong> – If you’re constantly handling things with your gloves on, like trekking poles, water bottles and other equipment, then there’s a chance your gloves will get damaged from all that use. Backpacking gloves that have a bit of tougher material sewn in to the palms will help a lot in preventing that damage.</li>
	<li><strong>Windstopper</strong> – Many of the better backpacking gloves on the market have something called Gore Windstopper sewn in to <!--more-->them. This material works as the name suggests, preventing wind chill, which can be a real problem with thin backpacking gloves in windy places. It’s a great way to keep your fingers warm without needing big, thick gloves.</li>
</ul>

But there are also a number of things that add to the warmth of a sleeping bag, and will keep you warm and toasty. Obviously, the temperature rating of the sleeping bag is a good indicator of just how warm that sleeping bag will be. And there are always other things you can do, like wearing your sweater to bed, for instance, that will add warmth to a sleeping bag.
<h2>Warmest Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the warmest sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Draft Collar</strong> – You will likely want a draft collar, and a few other extras like a drawcord on the hood, to help add warmth. These features help to hold the warm air that your body generates inside the sleeping bag. If there are gaps in places, that warm air will escape, and cold air will have a chance to get inside your sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Mummy Shape</strong> – Another thing that you definitely want when trying to get the warmest sleeping bag possible is a mummy shaped sleeping bag. The extra space <!--more-->inside a rectangular sleeping bag will only sap heat away from you and allow it to dissipate. Less space inside a mummy shaped sleeping bag means more concentrated body heat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Warmest Sleeping Bag Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the warmest sleeping bags, at a few different temperature points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - With a <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, this option from Mont Bell makes an excellent four season sleeping bag. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, but what makes it particularly warm is Mont Bell's unique construction method, where the baffles are cut at a 45 degree angle, so that the sleeping bag coils and squeezes around you at night as you move, increasing the warmth. It also has standard features like a <strong>draft collar, and the shell is water repellent</strong>, so you wont get cold if your sleeping bag gets wet. It <strong>weighs 2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-phantom-sleeping-bag-0-degree-down\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - The Phantom is one of the better sleeping bags with a <strong>0 degree temperature rating</strong>, and there are quite a few of them. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, but the feature that makes it warmer than the competition is the <strong>relatively narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>. This cut eliminates as much unused space as possible inside the sleeping bag, without making things too cramped. So the heat that your body generates fills a smaller area, and thus makes you warmer. It also weighs an impressive <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795904/marmot-cwm-eq-40-sleeping-bag\">Marmot CWM EQ</a> - If you're serious about needing the warmest, then there are few sleeping bags that are warmer than the CWM, which has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of -40</strong>. This sleeping bag isn't messing around. The draft collar is top notch, and the drawcord around the hood provides a good seal without feeling uncomfortable. And the <strong>entire outer shell is waterproof</strong>, because when the temperature outside is -40, you really do not want the <strong>800+ fill down</strong> inside getting wet and losing its ability to insulate. The bag <strong>weighs 4 pounds 10 ounces, or 2.o9 kilograms</strong>.</li>

One the one hand they need to be able to keep up with rain, snow, mud and the other ugly conditions that you often find in the winter. But they also need to be comfortable, and to do a half decent job of breathing, so that you don’t end up overheating. Finding that perfect pair of winter hiking pants can be hard, but it’s certainly not impossible, and there are some definite good choices out there.
<h2>Winter Hiking Pants</h2>
What you will likely want from a pair of winter hiking pants.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Depending on the conditions you’re hiking in, it might be a good idea to look in to waterproof winter hiking pants. If you’re going to be spending a lot of time in the snow, for instance, or if you’re in a  part of the world that experiences a lot of rain during the winter, then waterproof might be a good idea.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Any time that you get clothing that is waterproof or even water resistant, you run in to breathability problems. So if you get winter hiking pants that are waterproof or water resistant, it would be a good idea to get pants that have<!--more--> some sort of ventilation option as well, so you don’t end up overheating. Breathable fabric, at a minimum, is something that you will want.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763785/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-mens\">Arc'Teryx Alpha SL Rain Pants</a> - If you want a well built, solid pair of winter hiking pants that will definitely keep you dry, the Alpha SL pants are a good choice. They're <strong>made with Gore-Tex Paclite</strong>, which is one of the <strong>more breathable versions of Gore-Tex</strong>. The knees and seat are both highly articulated, and the <strong>bottom of each leg has a long zipper</strong> so that you can take the pants on and off without taking your boots off. An all around great pair of pants, especially if you want Gore Tex.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pants</a> - The Torrentshell pants are <strong>more of a budget option</strong>, though still a good option for winter hiking. They're <strong>nylon, with a DWR finish</strong>, which puts them in the <strong>water resistant or semi-waterproof category</strong>. One benefit of this is that they are at least very breathable. They also have zippers on the lower legs, for easy on and off without having to take your boots off.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Winter Hiking Pants</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763470/arcteryx-alpha-sl-rain-pants-womens\">Arc'Teryx Alpha SL Rain Pants</a> - A very good option if what you want is the dependability of Gore Tex. These use <strong>Paclite, which is one of the more breathable version of Gore Tex</strong>, and a good choice for hikers who don't want overheated, sweaty legs. The knees are highly articulated, which is a nice feature to have for hikers who are moving around a lot, and the <strong>bottom of the pants have a zipper</strong>, so that you can put these on as a shell without having to take your boots off to do so.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pant-womens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pants</a> - These are slightly less than waterproof, being <strong>made of nylon with a DWR, or durable water repellent coating</strong>. But less waterproofing typically means more breathable, so if you want something that's water resistant and breathes well, these are ideal. And being just a DWR coated nylon, these are <strong>quite a bit cheaper than the Gore Tex option</strong> above. They also have a zipper on the lower leg, to facilitate taking the pants on and off without taking your boots off.</li>

Staying dry is important, after all, especially when the temperature starts dipping. The last thing that you want to be is both wet and cold. Of course if your rain jacket holds all your sweat in then you end up getting wet, even if it’s not from the rain, and so the best rain jackets allow moisture to escape too.
<h2>Best Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're in the market for a new rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pit Zips</strong> – An essential feature of any good rain jacket is ventilation, and there is no better ventilation than pit zips. These are zippered openings under either armpit. When you get hot, and you feel the sweat coming on you can undo either zipper, and allow fresh air to circulate through your armpits and in to the jacket.</li>
	<li><strong>Gore-Tex</strong> – There are a variety of materials that get touted as being waterproof, but only a <!--more-->few that will really keep you dry all day long through pouring rain. Gore-Tex is a safe bet for a high quality rain jacket, and eVent is a similar fabric that does an excellent job of keeping you dry.</li>

It's made with <strong>Gore Tex 3L Pro, which is the best and most durable that Gore Tex has to offer</strong>.

A <strong>Gore Tex hiking jacket</strong> will keep you dry, but will also breath very well, which is the ideal combination to have in a hiking jacket that you expect to get wet in.

<h2>Gore Tex Hiking Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a Gore Tex hiking jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> – There are actually a few different kinds of Gore Tex that you have to choose from. Paclite, for instance, is a thinner, more breathable kind of Gore Tex. It’s still a good choice, but isn’t quite as waterproof as something like 3L Pro Gore Tex, which is a much more dependable fabric choice, though it is thicker and heavier.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Gore Tex will breath well, but even so hiking can be hard work, and a waterproof jacket is not going to do you much good if you end up getting <!--more-->soaking wet from sweat that hasn’t been allowed to properly ventilate. One of the most common, and most effective forms of ventilation are pit zips, which are zippered openings underneath the armpits.</li>

It also has a whole bunch of more subtle features, like an <strong>extended length, a minimal amount of seams and a laminated drawcord and hem</strong>, rather than sewn, that help to separate it out from the competition. This is an expensive jacket, but then there's a reason for that.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist</a> - If you're not looking to spend the kind of money that Arc'teryx jackets command, then the Marmot Minimalist might be a better choice. It uses <strong>Gore Tex Paclite, which is the lighter, more breathable</strong> version of Gore Tex. It has a few essentials, like pit zips and a zippered chest pocket, but this jacket is <strong>designed to be small and lightweight</strong>, like the name suggests. <strong>Perfect for backpackers, hikers and campers</strong> looking for a packable Gore Tex jacket that you can wear around town too.</li>

Running will require very specific kind of snowshoe, while heading off the trail and in to the backcountry with a big, heavy backpack on while require a very different kind of snowshoe. This is what you need to think about before buying snowshoes.
<h2>Choosing Snowshoes</h2>
The three major categories that exist when it comes to snowshoes.
<h3><strong>Hiking Snowshoes</strong></h3>
For the general hiker or recreational snowshoer, you don't need anything too fancy. Something that has <strong>enough crampons to have a few adventures off of the trail, and something that doesn't weigh so much that you're exhausted</strong> after a few minutes of snowshoeing. For <!--more-->recreational snowshoeing, you're probably not looking to spend too much either.

For general hiking, there's few snowshoes better than the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22s</a>. They're <strong>plastic</strong>, but plastic is good in a few ways. First, it's a lightweight material. At <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong> these are some of the lighter hiking snowshoes around. Plastic is also quite a bit cheaper than the standard aluminum frame and nylon deck combination. These particular snowshoes will only <strong>hold up to 180 pounds, but you can get <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a></strong> that will improve that to 250 pounds.
<h3><strong>Running Snowshoes</strong></h3>
For running snowshoes you're looking for something more specific. <strong>Running snowshoes should be, more than anything else, lightweight</strong>. Running is hard work, after all, and it's a lot harder when you've got something heavy strapped to your feet. With a pair of good, lightweight snowshoes, however, you will wont have to worry about exhausting yourself in the first few minutes of a run.

For running, there's no snowshoe better than the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Race snowshoes</a>. At just <strong>2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong>, they're among the lightest snowshoes available, and use superior materials, like <strong>high quality aluminum</strong>, to achieve that weight. The bindings are a simple one pull system, and Altas has a <strong>spring loaded suspension technology</strong> that helps these snowshoes to not interfere with your natural running gait. If you're scared away by the price, Atlas makes another snowshoe, called the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\">Atlas Run snowshoes</a>, that is the <strong>same basic design and quite a bit cheaper</strong>, though also a bit heavier.
<h3><strong>Backcountry Snowshoes</strong></h3>
Backcountry snowshoes are something a little more complex. They usually have <strong>more, and better crampons</strong>, so that when you're climbing steep slopes you're not slipping back down the hill. Backcountry snowshoe also typically have what's called a heel lift bar, which helps with leg fatigue when going up. And finally, you'll need a <strong>snowshoe with a high enough weight capacity</strong> for both you and your backpack.

If you want something for the mountains, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 Series</a> is an excellent choice. It comes in <strong>three different sizes, the largest of which will carry an impressive 300+ pounds</strong>, which is more than enough capacity for most people plus a heavy backpack. At <strong>4 pounds 3 ounces, or 1.9 kilograms for the medium</strong> they're also a respectable weight. Some <strong>solid crampons and a heel lift bar</strong> round out the features, and make these a very solid backcountry snowshoe. There's also a <strong>women's version</strong> called the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas Elektra 12 Series</a>."

Maybe you get really powdery snow, or you strap on a heavy backpack and start sinking in. Whatever the case, snow down your boots is often a reality of snowshoeing, but not if you have a good pair of snowshoe gaiters.
<h2>Snowshoe Gaiters</h2>
Things you want to see on a good pair of snowshoe gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – When snow goes flying it really goes flying, and so something like ankle height gaiters is unlikely to cut it, unless you can make them work with a good pair of snow pants. It makes things a lot easier if you get the full length gaiters, that go up to at least the mid-calf, so that you can be sure the snow stays out.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Another thing that you definitely want is waterproof snowshoe gaiters. Snow by itself can actually be quite dry, but it has a <!--more-->habit of sticking to clothing like gaiters and then melting, from your body heat. So get waterproof gaiters if you don’t want to get wet from melting snow.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Snowshoe Gaiters</h2>
Some of the better choices when it comes to snowshoe gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827256/the-north-face-gore-tex-gaiters\">The North Face Gore-Tex Gaiters</a> - First up, a very solid pair of gaiters from The North Face. They're made with <strong>Gore Tex uppers,  which will definitely keep you dry, and on the bottom heavyweight cordura nylon</strong>, which will shrug off any wear and tear. These are a heavy duty pair of gaiters that would be right at home on a mountaineering trip, and would make a great pair of snowshoe gaiters for the serious snowshoe enthusiasts, or the more casual hikers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - The Crocodiles have been <strong>around since way back in 1999, when they won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>. They've survived this long because they're an extremely popular product. The <strong>upper portion is very tough taslan Gore Tex, and the bottom is very tough cordura nylon</strong>. Like the North Face gaiters above these are made to handle even the worst that mountaineering can throw at them, and will perform well on a casual hike too. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-alpine-gaiter-men-s\">Rab Latok Alpine Gaiters</a> - If you don't need something big and heavy duty for snowshoeing, and just want something that will keep you dry, the Latok gaiters are ideal. The <strong>uppers are made with 3 layer eVent, which will keep you dry, but will breath better than the heavy duty Gore Tex</strong>. The bottom portion is made with a lighter weight cordura nylon than the gaiters above. Like the two above they're a mid-calf length, however, which is ideal for keeping snow out. So a great pair of snowshoe gaiters that are ideally suited to the range of snowshoeing activities.</li>

So before you go out and buy a new pair of boots for hiking it pays to do a little research. That way you know what you need from a pair of hiking boots, and also what you don’t need.
<h2>Hiking Boots for Men</h2>
Some features to look at when shopping for hiking boots for men.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Most hiking boots come with some sort of waterproofing, but the kind of waterproofing matters. As far as liners go, Gore Tex is always a safe option. And a good, full leather exterior on the boot also helps to repel a good amount of water, provided that it is properly maintained.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Just because you’re wearing hiking boots, doesn’t mean they have to weigh a lot. Every pound <!--more-->on your feet is equal to about five pounds on your back, in terms of energy expended, and so if you don’t to be exhausted and dragging your feet at the end of the day, it pays to get a pair of lightweight hiking boots.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Boots for Men</h2>
A few of the better hiking boots for men, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-mens\">Scarpa Kailish GTX Boots</a> - These boots are made to be lightweight. Even the sole, from Vibram, is called the Vibram Hi-Trail Lite sole. And it doesn't hurt, either that they <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. Besides the Vibram sole these boots feature a <strong>Gore Tex liner</strong>, which in combination with the mostly suede outer will do a good job of keeping your feet dry. But the <strong>weight, which is 1 pound 6 ounces, or 623 grams, is definitely the main selling point of this boot</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693828/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-mens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - At the other end of the spectrum is the quite heavy TPS 520s, which weigh in at <strong>3 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.72 kilograms</strong>. So almost three times as much as the Kailish boots above. But you do get a lot for that extra weight. The <strong>Gore Tex liner is almost redundant, as these come with full grain leather outers</strong> which will do a good job of keeping the outside world out of your boots. They also have a <strong>rugged Vibram sole, and are generally built to last through years and years of tough use</strong>. Not lightweight, but built like a tank.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/zephyr-backpacking-boot-men-s\">Kayland Zephyr Backpacking Boots</a> - The lightest boots on this list are not the Kailish boots up above but these, from Kayland, which weigh an even more <strong>impressive 1 pound 3.4 ounces, or 550 grams</strong>. The <strong>sole is Vibram, but what really helps to make these lightweight is the eVent liner. eVent is a waterproof fabric similar to Gore Tex, though it's generally lighter</strong>, which is on full display with these boots. And it helps that they won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award. So another excellent pair of lightweight hiking boots for men.</li>

But thermolite is different, in that a <strong>thermolite sleeping bag liner</strong> is meant for just one thing, really, and that is adding warmth. If you want to turn a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag, for instance, then you would use a thermolite sleeping bag. Thermolite is also fairly comfortable to sleep against, but its primary use is warmth.
<h2>Thermolite Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a thermolite sleeping bag liner.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Degrees Added</strong> – The primary purpose of a thermolite sleeping bag liner is to add warmth to your sleeping bag, boosting its minimum temperature rating. But there are a variety of thicknesses when it comes to thermolite liners, which will determine exactly how many degrees get added.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – The shape of the sleeping bag liner is another important determinant in your purchasing <!--more-->process. A mummy shaped sleeping bag liner is best suited for a mummy shaped sleeping bag, for instance, and would just unnecessarily constrict you when in a rectangular sleeping bag.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thermolite Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
There aren't many of them, but these are the best thermolite sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor</a> - This mummy shaped thermolite sleeping bag liner is the main sleeping bag liner in the Reactor liner from Sea to Summit. It will <strong>add approximately 15 degrees of warmth</strong> to your sleeping bag, and weighs a very nice <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>. A perfect way to add a good bit of warmth to your sleeping bag without adding much weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797114/sea-to-summit-thermolite-reactor-extreme-mummy-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme</a> - The Reactor Extreme is the warmest thermolite sleeping bag liner. It will <strong>add a very impressive 25 degrees of warmth</strong>, which is more than enough to turn a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag. And it <strong>weighs just 14 ounces, which is 390 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797113/sea-to-summit-reactor-plus-thermolite-compact-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Plus</a> - The Reactor Plus is something a little different. It <strong>uses the basic thermolite fabric for the entire liner, but then has panels of the warmer, thicker Reactor Extreme fabric</strong> around the torso and the foot box. So you get extra warmth, but distributed to the areas that you need it most. It will <strong>add about 20 degrees of warmth</strong>, but of course some areas will be warmer than others. It weighs <strong>just 9.3 ounces, or 260 grams</strong>. So a great combination of warmth and weight savings.</li>

The <strong>best cold weather sleeping bag</strong> will keep you warm in the worst of conditions. Cold weather often comes with things like wind, rain and snow, all of which can conspire to make for a very cold night. But with a good cold weather sleeping bag you will be prepared for such conditions, and will make it through the night warm and comfortable.
<h2>Best Cold Weather Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best cold weather sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – The best cold weather sleeping bag is one with a temperature rating suitable for the conditions you’re going in to. If your sleeping bag isn’t up for the kind of cold nights that you’re going in to then you’re destined to end up cold and likely miserable, regardless of everything else.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Cold weather is rarely just cold. It’s often windy, and more importantly, wet. And <!--more-->the last thing you want to do is allow the insulation inside your sleeping bag to get wet, especially if it’s down. So getting a water resistant sleeping bag, or possibly even a waterproof sleeping bag is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cold Weather Sleeping Bag Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the better cold weather sleeping bags to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/helium-15-sleeping-bag-850-down\">Marmot Helium 15 Sleeping Bag</a> - First up, the very popular Helium 15 from Marmot. It uses <strong>high quality, 850+ fill down</strong>, and has a <strong>durable water repellent finish to protect that down from getting wet</strong>,which is always a good thing to have on a cold weather sleeping bag. Beyond that it has  the <strong>draft tube along the zipper, draft collar around the neck and drawcord around the face</strong> that will all help to keep you warm. And at just <strong>2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>, you wont find many sleeping bags with a <strong>15 degree temperature rating</strong> lighter than this.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom +0 Sleeping Bag</a> - There are quite a few <strong>0 degree sleeping bags</strong> to choose from, but the Phantom is unquestionably one of the best. First, it weighs just <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>, which is extremely lightweight. It gets there, in part, by having a <strong>very narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>, and by using high quality <strong>800+ fill down</strong>. It has what you need to stay warm, like a good draft collar, but the impressive weight really is the best feature of this sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-puma-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-25-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Puma Gore WS Sleeping Bag</a> - For those truly cold nights, the Puma Gore WS, with a minimum <strong>temperature rating of -25</strong>, will definitely keep you warm. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is the good stuff, but what helps this cold weather sleeping bag stand out is the <strong>exterior shell fabric, which is Gore Windstopper</strong>. This fabric does an okay job of keeping water out, and an excellent job of keeping wind chill out. So a great choice for cold, stormy conditions. And it weighs a very reasonable <strong>3 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.64 kilograms</strong>, which is a great weight for such a low minimum temperature.</li>

But for campers, backpackers, hikers and anyone else who has to carry their own gear over a long distance, weight can matter quite a bit. Why carry a heavy down jacket, after all, when you could be carrying an <strong>ultralight down jacket</strong> instead? The lighter a down jacket is, generally, the better it will compress as well, and the better it will fit in to an already crowded backpack.
<h2>Ultralight Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when buying an ultralight down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fill Quality</strong> – All other things being equal, the down jacket with the higher quality down will weigh less. So a 900+ fill down jacket will weigh less than a 700+ fill down jacket. If you want an ultralight down jacket, then, get one with as high a filly quality as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood can be a useful feature to have on a jacket, but part of the reason for a hood <!--more-->is to protect from the rain, and you definitely don’t want to be getting a down jacket wet, so you probably wont be using the hood for when it rains. So getting a down jacket without a hood wont impact performance too much, and it also saves weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Down Jacket</h2>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight</a> - If you want an ultralight down jacket, but you want a few pockets to put your hands in too, Patagonia's Ultralight jacket is ideal. <strong>Besides hand pockets it also has a zippered chest pocket and a hood</strong>, so plenty of options for keeping those extremities warm.

A <strong>waterproof soft shell jacket</strong> would generally be considered a hard shell jacket, because that’s the name given to waterproof jackets. But despite this, there are a few waterproof soft shell jackets out there. They aren’t quite as waterproof as something like a Gore Tex jacket, you likely wouldn’t want to get caught in a rain storm with them, but they will certainly keep you dry longer than just a water resistant soft shell jacket.
<h2>Waterproof Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a waterproof soft shell jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – When buying a waterproof soft shell jacket you want to pay special attention to the method and material that is being used to do the waterproofing. The method or material used will determine, to a large extent, how long you stay dry for. It pays to do this research before you find yourself in that rainstorm.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If you’re going to get a waterproof soft shell jacket then it might be a good idea to also <!--more-->get a jacket that has a hood. Just about all rain jackets and hard shell jackets come with hoods, after all, and if you plan on staying dry with your waterproof soft shell jacket, you will likely want a hood too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Soft Shell Jacket</h2>
Some of the better waterproof soft shell jackets for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Waterproof Soft Shell Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816399/marmot-zion-jacket-mens\">Marmot Zion Jacket</a> - The Zion uses a <strong>unique fabric called Neoshell that makes it waterproof</strong>, but also a soft shell. It remains breathable, just like a soft shell jacket should, but also blocks out most of the wind, so it has all the right soft shell jacket features, but is also waterproof. The <strong>seams are also taped</strong>, so they wont leak water. Finally, the <strong>shoulders are reinforced</strong>, so that you can wear a backpack without damaging the exterior.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-kepler-softshell-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Kelpler Softshell Jacket</a> - Another <strong>soft shell jacket with waterproof functionality</strong>. The Kepler uses a waterproofing method called Dry.Q Elite, which blocks water and wind too, while remaining breathable, which is the best of both worlds when it comes to soft shell jackets. Besides that the <strong>seams are also taped against water</strong>, and the jacket has the standard configuration of two zippered hand pockets and one zippered chest pocket. It even <strong>has underarm zips</strong>, to keep you well ventilated.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Waterproof Soft Shell Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-zion-jacket-womens\">Marmot Zion Jacket</a> - The Zion is <strong>water resistant or waterproof, depending on who you ask</strong>, but according to Marmot at least the Neoshell fabric will keep you dry, while still keeping out wind and breathing well. It has two zippered hand pockets, along with one on the chest and one of the arm, so plenty of storage options. <strong>Smaller details, like taped seams</strong>, also help to keep water out, and make this a great waterproof soft shell jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-zahra-softshell-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Zahra Softshell Jacket</a> - The Zahra is one more jacket that rides the fence between waterproof jacket and soft shell jacket. It will indeed keep you dry in wet weather, will keep the wind out, and will also breath well. It even has <strong>underarm zippers</strong> to help with ventilation. Besides that it has <strong>two zippered hand pockets, one zippered chest pocket and taped seams throughout</strong>, to aid in the waterproofing. So another very good waterproof soft shell jacket.</li>

The <strong>best hiking rain jacket</strong> will keep you dry from the rain outside, and the moisture inside too, like sweat. And if you spend a lot of time with a backpack on, there are some excellent options available to make hiking and backpacking in the rain a more enjoyable experience.
<h2>Best Hiking Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best hiking rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are plenty of different materials that rain jackets get made from, but some are more waterproof than others. It’s important to do your research and find out just how good the material you’re buying is. You don’t want to get out in the rain, only to discover that your jacket isn’t all that waterproof after all.</li>
	<li><strong>Reinforced</strong> – If you tend to be carrying a heavy backpack while hiking, or if you like to spend a <!--more-->lot of time backpacking, then you will likely want a rain jacket that is reinforced in the shoulders and along the waist, which are the two areas where backpack straps will rub, and potentially damage a rain jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Rain Jacket Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the best hiking rain jackets for men and women too.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - The Super Mica is a jacket <strong>designed squarely with a person who like to carry a backpack in mind</strong>. The hand <strong>pockets are raised up</strong>, for example, to allow you to access them when your backpack hip belt is done up. And the <strong>hips and shoulders of the jacket are reinforced</strong>, so that the jacket rubbing wont damage the waterproof material. And speaking of material, the jacket uses <strong>Marmot's very thin and lightweight MemBrain fabric</strong>, so that you can throw this jacket in your backpack and forget about it until you really need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - The Torrentshell is an <strong>ideal choice for budget shoppers</strong>. It uses <strong>Patagonia's own H2No fabric</strong> to keep you dry, while still allowing sweat to escape. The seams are taped, and you get two zippered pockets for your hands, plus a zipper under each armpit to keep yourself ventilated when working hard. But beyond that this is a fairly basic hiking rain jacket aimed squarely at the person who wants to stay dry without spending a whole lot.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754256/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779570/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - The Alpha SV is the exact opposite of the Torrentshell above. It's expensive, and is a high quality jacket. First, it uses <strong>Gore Tex 3L Pro</strong>, which is the top of the line when it comes to Gore Tex's line of fabrics. It has the essentials, like pit zips and a couple zippered pockets for your hands. It also has a few extras, like <strong>increased length for an over-the-hips fit, a helmet compatible hood, and a minimal amount of seams that are laminated, rather than taped</strong>, to make sure water stays out. A seriously good hiking rain jacket for those that want the best, and are willing to pay for it.</li>

If you’re backpacking, hiking or doing anything else where you have limited backpack space especially, it pays to have a small, <strong>light rain jacket</strong> that you can stuff in to your backpack and forget about until you really need it. The best rain jacket is the one that you don’t even know you’re carrying, until you need it.
<h2>Light Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a light rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The most important thing to consider when looking for a light rain jacket is the material the jacket is made out of. A heavy, 3 layer Gore Tex will do an excellent job of keeping you dry, but will be bulky and heavy. Something like Gore Tex Paclite would do a better job, as would something like eVent.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – One good reason to get a light rain jacket is that it is likely to breath better. Lighter, thinner <!--more-->materials tend to allow more air circulation, which is always a good thing when you’re out and staying active. But you should also look for other ventilation options, like pit zips, that will help you stay cool and sweat free inside your rain jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Light Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best light rain jackets for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827541/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-mens\">Marmot Minimalist Rain Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762351/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - It's right there in the name, this is a jacket designed with minimalism in mind. It uses Gore Tex, but the <strong>lightweight and very breathable 2.5 layer Paclite Gore Tex</strong>. And while it has <strong>pit zips and a few pockets</strong> it doesn't have much else, and does a good job of living up to the Minimalist name. So if you want a light Gore Tex rain jacket, this is a good choice. It weighs <strong>15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-2-5-storm-jacket-men-s\">GoLite Tumalo Pertex Storm Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-strom-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - This is the lightest waterproof jacket from a company that named themselves after the idea of going light. It's another <strong>2.5 layer jacket, but uses Pertex</strong> to keep you dry and breathing well. It has <strong>pit zips and a few zippered pockets for your hands</strong>, but like the Minimalist above it's lacking on the features so that it can have a low weight, and at just <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong> you'll hardly even notice that you're carrying it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-super-mica-jacket-mens\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - One more light rain jacket, this one designed with anyone who carries a backpack in the rain in mind. First, the <strong>shoulders and the hips are both reinforced</strong>, so that you don't have to worry about your backpack straps rubbing and damaging the fabric. The <strong>pockets are also raised slightly</strong>, so that they wont be covered by a backpack hip belt. The jacket uses Marmot's MemBrain fabric to keep you dry and ventilated. And at <strong>8.7 ounces, or 246 grams</strong> this is just barely the lightest rain jacket on this list.</li>

In such a case, getting a good pair of <strong>hiking liner socks</strong> to act as a second skin against your first skin might be a good idea. A properly fitted and functioning hiking liner sock can do a lot to prevent some of the more common foot problems that can be caused by all the rubbing that is often associated with socks. And if a liner sock will prevent foot problems, it’s an easy decision to make as far as whether or not you should get a pair.
<h2>Hiking Liner Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for hiking liner socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Toe Socks</strong> – One common area where people have foot problems is the toes. They often rub together, which causes all kinds of problems. But the average pair of liner socks wont do much to prevent your toes from rubbing together. Socks with individual toes, however, will prevent your toes from rubbing together, and thus prevent all the foot problems associated with that rubbing.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Just like with regular socks, you have a couple of options to choose from when picking out the <!--more-->material for your hiking liner socks. Wool is an obvious choice, of course, because it breathes well and wicks moisture well, but there are other synthetic options that will do a good job too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Liner Socks</h2>
A few of the very best hiking liner socks to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/806483/injinji-lightweight-crew-toesocks\">Injinji Lightweight Crew Toesocks</a> - The reason that a lot of people turn to hiking liner socks in the first place is that they have foot problems. Many people get problems with their <strong>toes rubbing together</strong>, however, and for that, the average liner sock isn't going to be of much use, and you need <strong>a liner with individual toes</strong>, like these from Injinji. Besides the unusual design they're <strong>a synthetic blend, with the main ingredient being CoolMax</strong>, which is a good material for wicking moisture, something that you definitely want your liner socks to do. So a good choice, particularly if you have toe problems.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/627663/rei-silk-one-liner-socks\">REI Silk One Liner Socks</a> - Silk is not likely the first fabric that people think of when choosing hiking liner socks, but it's a fabric that feels great against the skin and does a solid job of preventing rubbing and other foot problems. <strong>Silk is blended with nylon and spandex to provide a tight, stretchy fit and to help absorb and wick moisture</strong>. If you want a soft, thin, luxurious hiking liner sock, these are them.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/smartwool-hiking-liner-crew-sock\">SmartWool Hiking Liner Crew Socks</a> - Wool makes an ideal sock material, and it makes an ideal sock liner material too. These are <strong>a very thin blend of wool, for moisture wicking and the natural anti-microbial properties, plus nylon for even more moisture management and spandex for a good, tight fit</strong>, which is important for a liner sock. They work wonderfully as a liner sock, and also do a good job as a stand alone hiking sock for warm weather.</li>

Even if you’re looking for the kind that zips all the way down, and doesn’t have to be pulled on, you have plenty of choices. And of course the length of the zipper is not the only choice you have when selecting a <strong>fleece zip jacket</strong>. Far from it. There are a few different variables for fleece jackets that make them useful pieces of clothing in a wide ranging set of environments and times of year.
<h2>Fleece Zip Jacket</h2>
What to look for from a fleece zip jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – Even the full zip fleece jackets come with hoods. And a good hood really can make quite a bit of difference when it comes to how warm you stay inside your jacket. Your head is one big heat source, after all, and if you want to stay warm one of the easiest things to do is to cover your head with something, like a hood.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Fleece isn’t a particularly great material to have on when the wind starts picking up and the <!--more-->wind chill starts stealing all of your body warmth. But a fleece jacket with a hardened outer surface does a great job of cutting down on the wind chill, and if you expect to be out in the wind it’s a feature you should be looking for.</li>
</ul>

Some of the very best fleece zip jackets for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Fleece Zip Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-acto-mx-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Acto MX Fleece Hooded Jacket</a> - This is the kind of full featured fleece zip jacket that is <strong>ideal for active pursuits in the outdoors</strong>. It's <strong>thinner fleece</strong>, but has a<strong> hardened soft shell exterior that makes it perfect for keeping out wind and rain</strong>. That, combined with the thinner fleece makes it ideal for bad weather but also breathable, for when you are staying active. It also <strong>comes with a hood, to keep your head warm, and a couple of long zippered chest pockets</strong>. The seams are even taped, to help keep water out. A seriously good fleece zip jacket for bad weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785468/mountain-hardwear-monkey-man-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Fleece Jacket</a> - The Monkey Man is a fairly unique jacket. It uses <strong>heavy, 300 weight fleece</strong> to keep you well insulated and block out the wind. It also has a <strong>plush and piled exterior that does a good job of keeping the outside world out</strong>. It has a couple of zippered pockets for your hands, and one on the chest to store a few things, but no hood and no hardened outer surface means it's probably not ideal for getting active in the outdoors.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Fleece Zip Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-acto-mx-hooded-fleece-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Acto MX Fleece Hooded Jacket</a> - The Acto MX is the kind of <strong>fleece jacket that you want to be wearing when you're out hiking hard and the weather turns ugly</strong>. It has a <strong>hardened outer surface that will keep a good amount of wind and water out</strong>, but is also relatively thin, so that the jacket does breathe well. There's also a hood, crucially, to keep your head warm and give you a few more options when it comes to staying warm. A <strong>couple of larger zippered chest pockets</strong> can also help with ventilation.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Woman Fleece Jacket</a> - The Monkey Woman is a more basic fleece zip jacket. There's <strong>no hood and no hardened outer surface</strong>. What it does have is <strong>thick, 300 weight fleece</strong>, and a piled and plush outer surface that does a good job of helping to keep wind and water out, despite not being hardened. So a good zip jacket if you're looking to stay warm more than be active.</li>

But <strong>hiking sleeping bags</strong> come in all kinds of different shapes and sizes, and it can be hard to know just what exactly you need. Where it starts, of course, is deciding on what you are expecting from your hiking sleeping bag. Hiking in cold temperatures, for instance, will require one kind of hiking sleeping bag, while hiking in summer weather will require a whole different kind of sleeping bag.
<h2>Hiking Sleeping Bags</h2>
What you want to look at when reviewing hiking sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – One of the more important things to look at when picking out a sleeping bag, as alluded to above, is the temperature rating. Before you set out you should find out what kind of temperatures you will need your sleeping bag to be warm enough for, and then get a sleeping bag with a corresponding temperature rating.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation Type</strong> – You also need to decide on what kind of insulation type you want your sleeping bag to<!--more--> have. Down is a great insulation that weighs very little, relative to the warmth you get, and packs down very small. Synthetic insulation, on the other hand, is a little heavier, but generally costs less and also performs much better when wet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best hiking sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - At the cooler end of things is the HighLite, which with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong> is ideally suited for warm summer nights. It's filled with <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is a very high quality, and weighs very little. The HighLite also uses a few features like a half length zipper and large square baffles to save on weight. Even with its cooler temperature rating, it manages to weigh a very impressive <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>, which is so little weight it will seem like you're not even carrying a sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - The Laser 600 is made by UK manufacturer Terra Nova, and is a high quality sleeping bag designed to minimize weight. It uses <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is about as high quality as down gets. It has a <strong>minimum temperature of 32 degrees</strong>, so only slightly warmer than the HighLite above. It also weighs in at <strong>20.5 ounces, or 580 grams</strong>, so also slightly heavier than the HighLite, but a great choice for those looking to save on weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808964/marmot-plasma-15-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma</a> - With a <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, the Plasma is <strong>somewhere between a 3 and 4 season sleeping bag</strong>. It will almost definitely keep you warm in spring, summer and fall, and most milder winter conditions too. Like the Laser 600 above it uses <strong>very high quality 900+ fill down</strong>. It also has a <strong>durable water repellent finish</strong> on the outside, which will keep the down dry, making it even more ideal for those wetter, colder months of the year. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a quality product. It weighs <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 900 grams</strong>.</li>

Wet feet is never fun, but in the summer, for instance, it’s hardly something that you have to worry much about. But when there’s snow on the ground you definitely do not want your feet to be wet. Wet, cold feet can mean serious foot problems, and if left for long enough, a serious health problem. Which is why it is so important to get a proper pair of <strong>snow hiking boots</strong> for those winter conditions.
<h2>Snow Hiking Boots</h2>
Features to try and find when shopping for snow hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – It should go without saying, but snow hiking boots should definitely be waterproof. Snow often sticks to boots where your body heat then melts it, and your feet can get rather wet from this if you don’t have a good, waterproof pair of snow hiking boots.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulated</strong> – Depending on just how cold outside it is, and how hard you’re going to be working, you <!--more-->might also want to invest in a pair of insulated snow hiking boots. When temperatures get down low in to the negatives, you have to worry about your feet being warm enough. A good pair of socks is definitely good, but so too are insulated boots.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/772901/keen-summit-county-winter-boots-mens\">Keen Summit County Winter Boots</a> - These are an ideal pair of snow hiking boots to stay active in. They're <strong>waterproof</strong>, with both <strong>full leather uppers and Keen's waterproof liner</strong> keeping water out.

Down is a material that lofts extremely well, and that space that is created by the loft is what keeps you warm. So the better the down inside the more of a <strong>puffy down jacket</strong> you will have, and the warmer you will be without adding any more weight to the jacket. The quality of the down, or the loft it provides is expressed like 700+ fill down. 900+ fill down, however, will loft a lot better, and be a lot more puffy, than 700+ fill down.
<h2>Puffy Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a puffy down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – As alluded to above, the quality of the down is what matters  it comes to how lofty, or how puffy your down jacket will be. So if you want a good, puffy down jacket that will also compress down in to a small package when you need to pack it away, you need the highest quality down you can find.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – If you want your down jacket to stay puffy then you need to keep the down itself dry. Wet <!--more-->down clumps, and when it clumps it wont loft up and get puffy like it used to, at least not until you let it dry out. So if you want your down jacket to stay puffy, you need to keep the down inside dry, and a water resistant exterior on the jacket will help.</li>

This is a fantastic technical down jacket. It has a <strong>great hood plus a few hand pockets</strong> to keep your extremities warm when things get chilly out.

It uses <strong>800 fill down and a durable water repellent shell</strong>, and while it has plenty of down inside to keep you warm, it's missing features like a hood that you might want for extreme weather.

A <strong>titanium camping pot</strong> is as lightweight, if not more so than a comparable aluminum pot. And a titanium camping pot will also be fairly strong, compared to a stainless steel camping pot. The only real disadvantage to a titanium camping pot is that they tend to be more expensive than either aluminum or stainless steel.
<h2>Titanium Camping Pot</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing a titanium camping pot.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – The more people you are cooking for, the bigger your pot is going to have to be. It can actually be helpful to get a set of pots, so that you have a pot big enough for just you, but if you end up needing to cook for two people you also have a pot that will hold enough water to cook enough pasta for the both of you.</li>
	<li><strong>Lid / Pan</strong> – If a pot isn’t going to be enough cookware to put together the gourmet backcountry masterpiece that <!--more-->you have in mind, then you might want to get a titanium camping pot that comes with a lid that will double as a pan. That way, you have a lid when you need it, and also a pan when you need one of those.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Titanium Camping Pot</h2>
Some of the very best titanium camping pots for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-trek-1400-titanium-cookset\">Snow Peak Trek 1400 Titanium Cookset</a> - If you need just one pot, then the Trek 1400 is an ideal choice. It's titanium, of course, and will hold <strong>47 fluid ounces</strong>, which is more than 5 cups and enough for room to cook dinner for 2. The <strong>lid also doubles as a frying pan</strong>, should you need the extra cooking surface, and each piece has a folding handle. And the whole thing weighs a very impressive <strong>7.4 ounces, or 209 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset</a> - Having multiple pots is always better than just one pot, because with multiple pots you have options. You can bring the big one for when you're cooking for more than just you, and the small one on a solo trip. This particular set comes with a <strong>34 fluid ounce pot and a 26 fluid ounce pot, along with 2 lids for both, both of which will double as a frying pan</strong>. Each of the 4 pieces has a folding handle, for easier storage, and together the whole thing weighs just <strong>11.6 ounces, or 328 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-non-stick-pot-w-handle\">Evernew Titanium Non-Stick Pot</a> - One of the most frustrating things about cooking in the outdoors is cleaning up afterwards. But a non-stick surface makes your job a whole lot easier. The pot <strong>comes in 7 different sizes, the smallest of which holds .6 liter and the largest of which holds 5.8 liters</strong>. The <strong>middle pot weighs in at 8.8 ounces, or 250 grams</strong>. The handle is also folding, but unfortunately the lid on these pots is just a lid, and not a frying pan too.</li>

Even a higher quality 1 man tent can cost hundreds of dollars, and that only goes up when you start looking at bigger tents with more capacity. So <strong>cheap camping tents</strong> are a good idea, especially if you want some money left over for other expensive items like sleeping bags and backpacks. And if you know what to look for, there’s no reason you can get a cheap tent that’s also a good tent.
<h2>Cheap Camping Tents</h2>
What to look at when you want cheap camping tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – As alluded to above, the more people your tent can fit, the more expensive it’s going to be. So if you want a cheap camping tent, consider getting a tent that’s just big enough for you, or maybe you and a significant other, and let other people worry about their own shelter needs.</li>
	<li><strong>Season</strong> – A four season camping tent is generally going to be a more durable, bombproof sort of tent, which will of course raise the price. So unless you really need a four season tent, it’s a good idea to stick to three season <!--more-->tents, and invest in a four season tent only if you end up really needing one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Camping Tents</h2>
Some of the very best cheap camping tents to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/731378/rei-camp-dome-2-tent\">REI Camp Dome Tent</a> - The REI brand is generally a value focused brand, and the Camp Dome series of tents is certainly cheap. This is the <strong>two person version, that comes with 31.5 square feet of floor space</strong>, which is plenty. It's a basic dome tent with <strong>2 doors, though no vestibule</strong>, just a bit of an awning to keep the rain off. And at <strong>4 pounds 15 ounces, or 2.23 kilograms</strong> this isn't a very lightweight option. But you're not likely to find a cheaper camping tent. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">4 man version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eureka-spitfire-2-tent-2-person-3-season\">Eureka Spitfire Tent</a> - The Spitfire is a bit of an unusual design, but it gets the job done. This is a <strong>two person version, with 38 square feet of floor space</strong>, but due to the pointed design, some of that space is not going to be of much use for sleeping. It also doesn't offer much in the way of a vestibule, but has <strong>two doors</strong> and will definitely do the job of keeping you dry at night. It weighs <strong>4 pounds 3 ounces, or 1.89 kilograms</strong> so again not a lightweight tent, but the price is right. It also comes in a smaller and cheaper <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eureka-spitfire-tent-1-person-3-season\">1 man version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\">Tarptent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is an ideal choice if you <strong>want a lightweight tent, but don't want to spend a whole lot</strong>. There's <strong>21 square feet of floor space, which is plenty of room for 1 person</strong>, and is just a few feet short of many smaller 2 man tents. Like the best lightweight tents it gives you the option to <strong>use trekking poles as supports</strong>, though you can also purchase a properly sized pole separately. It <strong>weighs just 24.5 ounces, or 700 grams</strong>, and while it's the most expensive tent on this list, it's a bargain compared to most lightweight tents that are in the same weight category.</li>

Fortunately, it’s possible to find a good pair of <strong>cheap gaiters</strong>, provided that you know what you’re looking for. A sale will make things a lot easier, but even without that, it’s not impossible to find a cheap pair of gaiters that you will be happy with. All you have to do is educate yourself a bit on what your options are.
<h2>Cheap Gaiters</h2>
What to look for if you want cheap gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>eVent</strong> – If you want waterproof gaiters then the obvious choice is Gore Tex. The problem, however, is that Gore Tex can be a rather expensive fabric. eVent, however, is a very similar waterproof fabric that is often quite a bit cheaper. It’s not as common as Gore Tex, but if you’re looking to save money it’s worth searching for it.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle Gaiters</strong> – Bigger, taller gaiters tend to cost more. So if you can make do with shorter ankle gaiters you will be able to save some money. If you’re looking for winter gaiters, to protect you from downpours or for <!--more-->walking through snow, then you don’t have much of a choice, you need the tall gaiters, but for everything else, you can likely make ankle gaiters work.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best of the cheap gaiters out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - If you want a <strong>full length, waterproof gaiters</strong>, there aren't any better choices than the Hispar gaiters from Rab. They use <strong>3 layer eVent</strong>, which is a fabric similar to Gore Tex, though known to be more breathable, which is never a bad thing for gaiters. The <strong>bottom section is 600D ballistic polyester</strong>, which is more than enough to prevent damage from boot rubbing and whatever other abuse your gaiters endure. The top is just a drawcord enclosure, but for the low price that's hardly something to complain about.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiters</a> - The Rab Latok gaiters are fairly similar to the Hispar gaiters above, but <strong>are ankle length</strong>, rather than calf length. They use the same <strong>3 layer eVent</strong> for the top portion, and a slightly different <strong>500D cordura nylon for the bottom</strong>. The eVent will keep you dry, of course, and if you don't mind the ankle length, these are a fantastic pair of cheap gaiters for bad weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803452/rei-desert-gaiters\">REI Desert Gaiters</a> - The Desert gaiters are just a <strong>basic nylon gaiter with no waterproofing or water resistance</strong>. In fact as the name suggests, these are really made more for warm weather, when you're likely to be more worried about rocks, sticks and dirt filling your shoes up. And these are actually <strong>designed to work with smaller hiking shoes and running shoes</strong>, as opposed to boots. The nylon wont keep you dry, but it will at least dry fast if it does get wet, and also <strong>offers UPF 30 protection</strong> from the sun.</li>

Fortunately, there are hundreds of tents out there to choose from, so one of them will fit your needs.
<h2>Best Camping Tents</h2>
What to look for when you want the very best camping tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re just car camping then you don’t have to worry about the weight of your tent, but if you’re going to be carrying your camping tent to your camp site, you would be crazy not to try and get the lightest camping tent possible. That way, you wont feel exhausted when you make to camp.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Capacity is another important variable when it comes to determining what the best camping tent for you is. A 2 person tent, for example, is versatile, especially<!--more--> if you have a friend or significant other that likes to join you. But a 1 person tent is good too, especially if you don’t mind camping solo.</li>

With <strong>28 square feet of floor space</strong> it's just big enough for two inside, and the <strong>weight of just 2 pounds 2 ounces, or 960 grams</strong> is part of the reason it <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It's definitely one of the lightest free standing tents you're likely to find, and a great choice for backpackers or just campers. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">1 person</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">3 person</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">4 person size</a>, along with an <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827911/big-agnes-fly-creek-2-platinum-tent\">ultralight 2 person version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/nemo-equipment-inc.-meta-2p-tent-2-person-3-season\">NEMO Equipment Meta 2p</a> - The Meta is a good take on something a little different, a tent where you can <strong>use trekking poles instead of tent poles</strong>. It's a nice and roomy <strong>2 person tent, with 36 square feet of floor space</strong>, plus a very roomy 22 square feet in the vestibule. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, but comes with plenty of ventilation, and at <strong>2.9 pounds, or 1.31 kilograms</strong> it's certainly a lightweight tent option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-1-tent-1-person-3-season\">Terra Nova Laser Photon 1</a> - The Laser Photon is an extremely <strong>lightweight 1 person tent</strong> that has enough room inside for 2, if you don't mind a bit of squeeze. It uses some very superior materials to achieve a minimum weight of just <strong>1 pound 7 ounces, or 660 grams</strong>, which raises the price but will leave you with a small and lightweight package when it comes time to pack up in the morning. So an excellent choice if you want a truly lightweight option.</li>

That’s the kind of tent that may very well end up getting flattened when you take it up to higher altitudes where wind is a much bigger problem. So what you need is an <strong>altitude tent</strong>, or something that can stand up the more severe weather that you typically experience at higher altitudes. Mountaineering tents and 4 season tents are a good place to start.
<h2>Altitude Tent</h2>
What to look for in an altitude tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Poles</strong> – Poles are the bones of a tent, they’re what give a tent structure. The more poles a tent has, all other things being equal, the better it will be able to stand up to strong winds. Similarly, a tent with low, sloped profile will shed wind better than a bigger tent, and so will be better suited to life at high elevations.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall</strong> – Many altitude tents are actually a single wall design. Tents with a separate rain fly are good because you can take the rain fly off if the weather is good, but that’s almost never going to be the<!--more--> case at high altitudes. So as long as the tent has ample ventilation, a single wall design does a good job of keeping you dry, and also cuts down on the weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Altitude Tent</h2>
Some of the very best altitude tents for outdoor adventures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747660/marmot-alpinist-2-tent\">Marmot Alpinist</a> - The Alpinist is clearly a tent built for high altitude conditions. It's <strong>low to the ground with sloping sides</strong>, so that it wont catch any wind. 3 poles provide a good amount of strength, and there is <strong>30 square feet of floor space</strong>, which is enough for <strong>2 people</strong>. It's also a <strong>single wall design</strong>, so it will keep you dry from the moisture outside, and adjustable air vents give you complete control of just how much ventilation you get inside. The whole thing <strong>weighs 4 pounds 15 ounces, or 2.24 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-fitzroy-tent-3-person-4-season\">Black Diamond Fitzroy</a> - The Fitzroy is labeled a <strong>3 person tent, but with just 35 square feet of floor space it's a rather cramped 3 person tent</strong>. Besides that, it has <strong>4 poles</strong>, so it's plenty strong for those high winds that you get at altitude, and is a <strong>single wall design</strong>, so you're not carrying any unnecessary weight. There's also plenty of ventilation inside, so you don't have to worry about condensation. The whole thing <strong>weighs 6 pounds 5 ounces, or 2.86 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dragontail-tent-2-person-4-season\">MSR Dragontail</a> - The Dragontail is something a little different. It's actually <strong>a tunnel tent</strong>, rather than the more common dome tent. The tunnel design doesn't exactly get it out of the wind, but it does add a considerable amount of strength. The Dragontail has <strong>30 square feet of floor space, so enough room for 2 people</strong>. It also has <strong>three poles, and a single wall design</strong>, so again you're not stuck with any excess weight. There's also plenty of ventilation to compliment the single wall design. It <strong>weighs 5 pounds 5 ounces, or 2.42 kilograms</strong>, and is a great choice if you want an altitude tent that's a little different.</li>

For long races that go in to the night, for instance, a <strong>high power headlamp</strong> is exactly what you need, because you’ll be moving fast and you’ll need something that illuminates a sufficient distance in front of you, so that you don’t get any surprises underfoot, and end up hurting yourself. Just remember that a high power headlamp left on high will drain your batteries rather quickly.
<h2>High Power Headlamp</h2>
What to look for when you want a high power headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – If you want to have a high power headlamp then the number you need to pay attention to is the lumens. The more lumens a headlamp can produce, the brighter it will be. Something like 300 lumens, for instance, will produce enough light that you wont have to worry about not being able to see anything in front of you.</li>
	<li><strong>Batteries</strong> – If you’re going to be producing a large amount of light for a significant amount of time then you’ll need a good battery to go along with your high lumens headlamp, otherwise your headlamp wont last all<!--more--> that long. Consider getting a headlamp with an auxiliary battery pack, which will last longer than a head mounted battery pack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best High Power Headlamp</h2>
Some of the best choices for a high power headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra</a> - There aren't too many headlamps that will do better than the Ultra from Petzl when it comes to brightness. With <strong>350 lumens</strong> at its disposal, there's not much that you wont be able to see when you turn the Ultra up to high. Unfortunately you can expect <strong>just 2 hours of running on high, and only 17 on low</strong>. It's a headlamp built for one thing, and that's to put out plenty of light. The <strong>batteries are rechargeable</strong>, however, so you wont have to worry about constantly buying new ones.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/x-shot-headlamp\">Mammut X-Shot</a> - The X-Shot gives you an impressive <strong>200 lumens</strong> to work with, which is more than enough for most people. But what really sets it apart is the <strong>multiple power settings, the lowest of which gives you a total of 500 hours of battery life</strong> to work with. You wont get much light on that setting, but you have the option, at least. It's also relatively <strong>small and lightweight, at just 5.2 ounces, which is 150 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-pro-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Pro</a> - Another headlamp with a <strong>maximum of 200 lumens</strong> of light. The Apex Pro also gets an impressive <strong>100 hours of usable light on the lowest power setting</strong>. What makes it a little different is that <strong>it's waterproof</strong>, so that you don't need to put it away when it starts raining hard, which is an area where a lot of headlamps actually fail. So an ultralight headlamp that's ideal for bad weather.</li>

<h2>Large Camping Tents</h2>
What you want to see when reviewing large camping tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As referenced above, large camping tents can get rather heavy, heavier than the combined weight of two smaller tents would be. So if you are going to be carrying your camping tent around very much, it’s a good idea to pay close attention to the weight of the tent, so that you don’t end up sore knees from a camping trip.</li>
	<li><strong>Doors and Separators</strong> – With more than 4 or so people in a tent it might become difficult to get a good, full night of sleep, just because sleeping in close proximity to so many other people will keep you awake. So it’s helpful to have a <!--more-->tent with things like partitions, to cut down on noise, and multiple doors, so that no one is getting stepped on in the night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Large Camping Tents</h2>
A few of the very best large camping tents, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL4</a> - The Fly Creek UL4 is a <strong>solid backpacking tent for 4 people</strong>. It uses a few ultralight design tricks, like the unique pole design, and some great fabrics to bring the weight down as low as possible, to just <strong>4 pounds 1 ounce, or 1.84 kilograms</strong>, which is a lot lighter than most other 4 person tents out there. The price reflects the superior construction and materials, of course, but when you're backpacking you want a lightweight tent. It's also <strong>free standing, has just 1 door unfortunately, and 49.5 square feet of floor space</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/limestone-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Marmot Limestone 6</a> - The Limestone 6 is something a little bigger, with <strong>room for 6 inside</strong>. It's also a <strong>cheaper large tent</strong>, in fact it costs significantly less than the smaller Fly Creek above. Of course the Limestone also <strong>weighs 11 pounds 12 ounces, or 5.33 kilograms</strong>, so there's quite a difference there. The Limestone does have <strong>2 doors</strong>, which is essential with 6 people inside, but no separator, so you might have to worry a bit if there's a snorer in the group. But there's also <strong>83 square feet of floor space</strong> to work with, so you certainly wont be crammed in either. So a solid tent, and a good choice if you're not looking to do anything beyond a little recreational camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-2-meter-dome-tent-8-person-4-season\">The North Face 2-Meter Dome</a> - The Dome from The North Face is a serious tent, with a serious price tag to reflect it. But it also has a total of <strong>125 square feet of floor space</strong>, and <strong>room for 8 inside</strong>, so if you need something really big it might be worth considering. But what this tent is <strong>designed for is 4 season camping</strong>, likely as a base camp tent, because at <strong>47 pounds, or 21.3 kilograms</strong> you're not going to want to carry it very far. It has <strong>2 big doors and 12 poles</strong>, so you wont have to worry about wind. So definitely not a large camping tent for the average recreational user, but something to consider for ugly weather conditions and expeditions.</li>

But there are also trekking poles out there that fold up, like tent poles. <strong>Folding trekking poles</strong> have a few distinct advantages, one of them being that you tend to end up with a smaller, more compact package when you use folding trekking poles, as opposed to telescoping trekking poles. Of course you cant, generally, adjust the length of folding trekking poles.
<h2>Folding Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look for when buying folding trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adjustable</strong> – Most folding trekking poles are not adjustable, and are a fixed length. Generally, if you want adjustable trekking poles you need to get telescoping trekking poles. There are, however, a few folding trekking poles that are somewhat adjustable, and an ideal choice if you cant decide on a specific length.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Part of the purpose of trekking poles is to take some of the pressure off of your knees, but <!--more-->heavy trekking poles tend to put a lot of strain on the arms and shoulders. So unless you want to trade tired knees for tired shoulders, it’s a good idea to try and find a lightweight pair of trekking poles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Folding Trekking Poles</h2>
You don't have too many choices, but these are the best folding trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/distance-z-poles\">Black Diamond Distance Z-Poles</a> - These are the basic Distance Z-Poles from Black Diamond. They're <strong>three sections of aluminum</strong> that fold down just like a tent pole when you're not using them. They actually <strong>assemble just like a avalanche probe</strong>, which means that you can have them fully assembled in just a few seconds. The pair <strong>weighs a total of 12.3 ounces, or 350 grams</strong>, and they come in several different lengths.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-distance-fl-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Distance FL Poles</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-distance-fl-trekking-pole-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Distance FL poles are very similar to the Z-Poles above, the difference being that the <strong>top of the three sections has an adjustable length</strong>, so that you can actually <strong>vary the length by up to 20 centimeters</strong>, making them a much more  versatile option. They come in several different sizes, and <strong>are aluminum</strong>, but because they have the adjustable length they weigh a little more than the fixed length Z-poles, at <strong>15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong> for the mediums.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813391/black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles</a> - The Ultra Distance Z-Poles are the lightweight version of the Z-Poles series, and <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. They're <strong>fixed length</strong>, like the Z-Poles above, and fold down in to <strong>three sections</strong>. The difference is that they're <strong>made from carbon fiber</strong>, rather than aluminum, which raises the price, but also significantly lowers the weight. At just <strong>9.5 ounces, or 269 grams</strong> for the medium size they're some of the lightest trekking poles, folding or otherwise, that you'll find anywhere.</li>

Some gaiters, for instance, are made with big, bulky mountaineering boots in mind. <strong>Hiking boot gaiters</strong> are good because they occupy a middle ground between the big, burly mountaineering boots and the smaller shoes, and just about all gaiters will fit them. And that means you have plenty of options to choose from when it comes to selecting your next hiking gaiters. It helps if you identify what you need your gaiters to do for you, and then do your shopping.
<h2>Hiking Boot Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when reviewing hiking boot gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Durable</strong> – Gaiters take a lot of abuse, and if you don’t want to be replacing them every year it pays to get a durable pair, rather than something cheaper that’s going to fall apart. Related to this, many gaiters make it possible to replace the strap that goes under your boot, which is one of the pieces of gaiters that takes the most abuse.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – If you expect to be trying to keep a lot of moisture off of you then you will likely want a pair of waterproof gaiters. If, however, you would <!--more-->rather have a pair of gaiters that will breath well, and aren’t so worried about getting wet, a pair of water resistant gaiters might be a more versatile option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Boot Gaiters</h2>
Some of the best possible hiking boot gaiters for your next outing.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-latok-mid-gaiter\">Rab Latok Mid Gaiters</a> - If you just need a pair of <strong>waterproof ankle gaiters</strong> to keep a little water and debris out of your shoes or boots while out hiking, then the Latok mid gaiters are a great choice. They <strong>use 3 layer eVent</strong> for the top portion, eVent being a fabric similar to Gore Tex, but generally regarded as more breathable, which is perfect for a pair of gaiters. So they don't give you the same protection that full length gaiters do, but sometimes all you need is ankle length gaiters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - The Hispar gaiters are the same <strong>3 layer eVent</strong> as the Latok mid gaiters above, but with a <strong>full calf length</strong>, so that you get more protection from the elements. Of course eVent is a good, breathable option, so while your feet wont get wet from outside moisture, they also wont end up sweating too much either. The <strong>bottom portion is made with 600D ballistic</strong> <strong>polyester</strong>, which will prevent most damage, but is not as heavy as the bottom material used on most mountaineering gaiters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/725915/outdoor-research-crocodile-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - If you would prefer a <strong>solid pair of mountaineering gaiters</strong> for going hiking in, then the Crocodiles are perfect. They <strong>won the 1999 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, which gives you an idea of how long they've been around. They' re <strong>completely waterproof on top, thanks to tough 3 layer Gore Tex material</strong>. The bottom is heavy duty 1000D cordura nylon, so a great choice for some casual hiking, or some not so casual adventures in the mountains.</li>

Of course a 3 watt headlamp LED will drain your batteries rather quickly, so you want to make sure that the 3 watt LED is not the only LED on your headlamp, unless you want to be carrying extra batteries around with you.
<h2>3 Watt Headlamp</h2>
What to look for when you want a 3 watt headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Power Settings</strong> – It’s best if your headlamp has several different power settings, especially if there is a 3 watt LED on your headlamp. That 3 watt LED will drain your battery quite quickly, and so if you want to conserve power, it helps if there are smaller, less powerful LEDs that can be switched on for those times when you don’t need high amounts of light.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life</strong> – As alluded to above, a 3 watt LED will drain a battery quickly, which is why it helps to have a big battery. If you’re going to need a lot of light for a long period of time, it might be worth considering a headlamp that has<!--more--> an auxiliary battery pack that can be worn on your belt, to extend the battery life of your headlamp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 3 Watt Headlamp</h2>
There aren't many, but here are the best 3 watt headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/icon-3-watt-led-headlamp\">Black Diamond Icon 3-Watt LED</a> - It's right there in the name, this is a 3 watt LED headlamp. More specifically, it has a <strong>maximum light output of 100 lumens</strong>, and a beam distance of approximately <strong>100 meters</strong>. It will even go for about 165 hours on the lowest battery setting, making it an ideal choice for a wide range of activities. It even <strong>won the Best in Gear award from Rock and Ice magazine</strong>. It weighs<strong> 6.6 ounces, or 188 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-pro-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Pro</a> - The Apex Pro is another headlamp with a combination of one especially bright 3 watt LED and a few smaller, bright LEDs, so that you get a good <strong>maximum lumens of 200</strong>, while at the same time the low power setting will <strong>go for 100 hours</strong> and provide ample illumination, thanks to the multiple smaller LEDs. It's also <strong>waterproof</strong>, which is a definite bonus for bad weather conditions. The whole thing <strong>weighs 6.2 ounces, which is 173 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786019/petzl-ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - If you really want a bright headlamp, then there are few options more impressive than the Ultra, which can put out <strong>350 lumens on the highest setting</strong>, which equates to a <strong>beam distance of about 120 meters</strong>. It manages that with a total of 6 high power LEDs, though it actually has no low power LEDs, which means that even on the lower power setting you only get 17 hours of battery life to work with. The <strong>battery is rechargeable</strong>, however, so you don't have to buy new ones every couple of hours of headlamp use. It <strong>weighs 12.2 ounces, which is 345 grams</strong>.</li>

But if you’re in charge of coffee for the group, you will need some more equipment, like a coffee pot. The <strong>best camping coffee pot</strong>, however, wont weigh an especially large amount, though there are definitely some out there that will add a lot of unnecessary weight to your backpack, so be careful and do your research.
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Pot</h2>
What to look at when you want the best camping coffee pot.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When it comes to your camping coffee pot, there are a few different potential materials for your pot to be made from. A stainless steel coffee pot, for instance, will be strong and relatively cheap, but will weigh more than something like titanium, which will be strong and lightweight, but no so cheap.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – The bigger your coffee pot is, the more coffee it will make. If you have a big group to make coffee for, then, you will want a big coffee pot that can accommodate them all, unless <!--more-->someone is willing to wait for a second batch. Make sure that you account for how many cups you want to make when picking out a camping coffee pot.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Pot Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the very best camping coffee pots.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401016/gsi-outdoors-baked-enamelware-coffee-pot\">GSI Outdoors Baked Enamelware Coffee Pot</a> - If you want just a straight <strong>percolator coffee pot</strong> then this one from GSI Outdoors is an excellent choice. It's <strong>baked enamelware on the outside, but with a stainless steel core</strong>, which is a great combination of durability and strength. It <strong>will hold 1.9 liters,</strong> which is enough capacity to make several cups of coffee for the group. It's not the lightest option in the world, however, at <strong>1 pound 5 ounces, or 595 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/litech-coffee-tea-press-kit\">Primus LitTech Coffee / Tea Press Kit</a> - This option  from Primus is actually a combination of a cooking pot and a coffee press. What this means is that you have <strong>a pot to press coffee in, but you also have a pot for cooking in</strong>, making it an excellent dual use item. The <strong>pot itself is aluminum</strong>, with folding handles for easy packing. Everything together also <strong>weighs just 9.8 ounces, which is 277 grams</strong>, and a reasonably lightweight choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - This is what you want, however, if you're really looking to save weight. It's a <strong>700 milliliter pot combined with a coffee press</strong>. The pot itself is tall and narrow, so while you could use it as a cooking pot it's a bit of an odd shape. But since it's <strong>titanium it weighs relatively little, at just 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>, making it the lightest option, though also the smallest. The pot itself also has folding handles, which makes it a lot easier to store in your backpack.</li>

Or perhaps you lost or damaged your stuff sack, or even want a compression stuff sack that will make it easier and more convenient to carry your sleeping bag. Whatever the case, there are some excellent sleeping bag stuff sacks out there to choose from, just as long as you know what to look for while shopping.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Stuff Sack</h2>
What to look for when you want a sleeping bag stuff sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Compression</strong> – One of the best things about packing a sleeping bag is that they compress down so much. And many sleeping bag stuff sacks take this in to account, and give you some way to compress your sleeping bag, so that it ends up taking up as little room as possible, leaving more room for other, more important things.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Another thing that you might definitely want your sleeping bag stuff sack to do is keep your sleeping bag dry. Materials like eVent, for instance, do an <!--more-->excellent job of keeping your sleeping bag dry, though they do tend to cost more than something like basic nylon, which is not waterproof.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Stuff Sack</h2>

Finally, it comes in <strong>five different sizes</strong>, and even better, <strong>won the 2007 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-stuff-sack-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Stuff Sack Pillow</a> - This isn't a compression sack, you just stuff your sleeping bag in and it's as big as it is. It's <strong>nylon, with a durable water repellent finish</strong>, so it's water resistant, rather than waterproof. But what really stands out about this particular sleeping bag stuff sack is that it has a <strong>plush liner on the inside, so that when you pull your sleeping bag out you can turn it inside out, stuff something else in and you instantly have a pillow</strong>, which is a fantastic feature that a lot of people will appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/round-rock-solid-compression-sack\">Granite Gear Round Rock Solid Compression Sack</a> - Another sleeping bag stuff sack, this one <strong>with compression straps</strong> so that you can make it as small as possible. It's <strong>just basic nylon for the exterior</strong>, however, so it's not waterproof or even all that water resistant, but as long as you keep your backpack dry that's not a huge problem. It also comes in an <strong>impressive 7 different sizes</strong>, so you can be sure that there is a size for you.</li>

But a <strong>cheap sleeping pad</strong> will keep you comfortable at night just fine. In fact, there are some extremely well made sleeping pads that have a low price point. A sale is always helpful too, but as long as you know what to look for from a sleeping pad, it’s easy to find something that will suit you well, without costing too much.
<h2>Cheap Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look for when you want a cheap sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Foam</strong> – Many people find sleeping on an inflatable sleeping pad to be more comfortable than foam, but one of the tradeoffs is that foam sleeping pads tend to cost quite a bit less than inflatable sleeping pads. With a foam sleeping pad, you also don’t have to worry about breaking the sleeping pad, and needing to buy a new one.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – Sleeping pads with a high R-value, which means they reflect more body heat, tend to have extra material and construction done, which raises the price. If you’re winter camping then you will need that warmth, but otherwise<!--more--> you can avoid sleeping pads with high R-values, and save some money in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Sleeping Pad</h2>
Some of the best cheap sleeping pads for your next camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - If nothing but an<strong> inflatable sleeping pad</strong> will do, then Big Agnes makes an excellent inflatable sleeping pad with a low price. It comes in a <strong>few different shapes and lengths</strong>, so you can get just what you need. It has an <strong>R-value of just 1</strong>, however, so don't expect much warmth from this sleeping pad. It's <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong> when inflated, so it's at least comfortable, and <strong>weighs just 15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong>, which is surprisingly light for a sleeping pad. So a good cheap inflatable sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z Lite</a> - If you want cheap them foam sleeping pads are always a good option. This is a popular foam sleeping pad from Therm-A-Rest, with plenty of features, but is still cheaper than just about any other inflatable pad. It has an <strong>egg carton design on top</strong>, to maximize thickness without impacting weight. It also <strong>folds up like an accordion</strong>, so that it's easy to strap on to the outside of your backpack, or anywhere else that is convenient. And at just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, it's also lighter than just about any other inflatable sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/374053/standard-blue-foam-pad-regular\">Standard Blue Foam Pad</a> - This is the absolute basic blue foam that many people are no doubt familiar with. It's very basic, but it works well enough, and is also extremely cheap. It's <strong>.38 inches thick</strong>, so not the most comfortable sleeping surface ever, and it has an <strong>R-value of 1.4</strong>, so not very warm either. This is is also <strong>just 56 inches long,</strong> which is is good for backpackers and campers looking to save weight, but if you want a proper length you can <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/374059/standard-blue-foam-pad-long\">find it here</a>. It does <strong>weigh just 7.5 ounces, or 212 grams</strong> however, so a good option if you want something that is both cheap and lightweight.</li>

A smaller, more compact sleeping bag leaves you with more room in your backpack for other stuff. The smallest sleeping bag is also going to tend to be the lightest sleeping bag, so getting a small, compact sleeping bag is also a very good way to save weight, and lower the overall weight of your load.
<h2>Smallest Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to consider when you want the smallest sleeping bag possible.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> – When it comes to down versus synthetic insulation, down is the more compact of the two choices, relative to warmth. So if you want a small sleeping bag, you’re better off with a down sleeping bag. Even more so, you’re better off with a sleeping bag with higher quality down, which is delineated by the fill count.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Obviously, another good way to reduce the overall size of your sleeping bag is to cut off the corners and taper it as much as possible to conform to your body shape, which is exactly what a mummy<!--more--> sleeping bag is. The more material that is removed from the sides of your sleeping bag, the smaller it is going to be.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Smallest Sleeping Bag Reviews</h2>
A few reviews of the very smallest sleeping bags for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795982/mountain-hardwear-phantom-15-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - First up, for those looking for a small sleeping bag that will keep them warm when the temperature drops down. The Phantom has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of just 15 degrees</strong>, making it ideal for four season camping in most parts of the world. What helps to make it small is <strong>800 fill down</strong>, first of all, which is very compressible, as well as a <strong>very narrow mummy cut</strong>, so that the sleeping bag is only as big as it really needs to be, cutting down on bulk as much as is possible. And at just <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 870 grams</strong> it's one of the lightest 15 degree sleeping bags you will ever get your hands on.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-600-sleeping-bag\">Terra Nova Laser 600</a> - What makes the Laser 600 a small sleeping bag is that it uses <strong>very high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which gives you the same amount of warmth with less down, which of course cuts down on bulk. It also <strong>has a mummy cut</strong>, which again, is meant to cut down on bulk and make the sleeping bag as small as possible. The <strong>temperature rating is 32 degrees</strong>, so ideal for three season use, and the <strong>weight is 1 pound 6.2 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>, which is far lighter than just about any other 32 degree sleeping bag. So not a cheap option because of the 900 fill down, but an excellent choice if you want a small sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Highlite</a> - The Highlite is the perfect sleeping bag for summer nights, or three season nights in some of the warmer parts of the world. A <strong>minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong> is not especially warm, but then this sleeping bag has a weight of <strong>just 1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>, which is small enough that you'll hardly even know you're carrying it. It <strong>uses 850 fill down</strong>, for starters, has just a half length zipper and even large, square baffles, all designed to lower weight and bulk as much as possible. So if you want something small for summer nights, this is it.</li>

For shorter, relatively easy trips where you’re with other people you don’t really have to worry about hurting yourself. Anything that you do you can likely deal with without a first aid kit. But when you get in to wilder areas for longer periods of time, and if you’re by yourself especially, a first aid kit for hiking is definitely a good item to have at the bottom of your backpack.
<h2>First Aid Kit for Hiking</h2>
What to consider when you want a first aid kit for hiking with.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Any first aid kit that you take in to the outdoors should be waterproof, or should be placed in something waterproof by you. Even just a ziplock bag will do the job. There are many items in a first aid kit, like bandages, that will be ruined be prolonged exposure to water, and so you should prevent that water exposure.</li>
	<li><strong>Foot Treatments</strong> – Food problems are one of the more common problems to have when out hiking, and first aid kits that are not made for hikers may not come <!--more-->with some of the more common foot treatments, like mole skin for blisters. So look for a kit that has hiker specific treatments, or add them yourself.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best First Aid Kit for Hiking</h2>
Some of the best first aid kits for taking hiking on your next outing.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-weekender-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Weekender First Aid Kit</a> - If you're going to be responsible for the first aid needs of a group of people over an extended period of time, then you want something like the Weekender kit. It's <strong>rated for 1 to 6 people for up to 7 days. It includes all the basics</strong>, bandages, essentials for cleaning and properly tending to wounds and some basic medication. But what makes it stand out are booklets on treating various injuries or ailments, miscellaneous gear like duct tape that could have plenty of uses, and things like disposable thermometers that might come in handy. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 10 ounces, or 737 grams, and is not waterproof</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/718294/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-9-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight / Watertight .9</a> - The .9 is the <strong>largest in a series of ultralight first aid kits</strong> that are ideal for taking hiking. The .9 size has enough medical <strong>supplies for 1 to 4 people for up to 4 days</strong>. It has the basics for properly cleaning a wound, bandaging the wound and a few medications for various things that hikers, backpackers and campers are likely to have to deal with while in the outdoors. It also has <strong>a few items, like Moleskin, that are likely essential for most hikers</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 10.4 ounces, or 294 grams</strong>, and comes with a waterproof, resealable bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-watertight-3-first-aid-kit-dryflex\">Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight / Watertight .3</a> - The .3 is the <strong>smallest size of the same line of ultralight first aid kits</strong> that the .9 above belongs to. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708124/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-5-first-aid-kit\">.5</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695383/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-7-first-aid-kit\">.7</a> size in between these two. The .3 size is quite a bit smaller, and is just <strong>meant for one person for a few uses</strong>. It's the absolute minimal amount of first aid equipment, the biggest difference between this size and the larger sizes being less of the basic supplies. So if you're just going to be responsible for yourself, something like the .3 first aid kit is likely perfect for you. It <strong>weighs just 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, and comes in a waterproof, resealable bag.</li>

As soon as you puncture that waterproof rain jacket material you give the water a way to get through to you on the inside. So something like a <strong>pullover rain jacket</strong> makes sense, because it reduces the amount of zipper that there is on your jacket, and thus the amount of potential leak spots where water might make it through. Of course it also helps that pullover rain jackets are often a little cheaper than a full zipper rain jacket.
<h2>Pullover Rain Jacket</h2>
What to consider when you're looking for a pullover rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – As alluded to above, seams and zippers will leak if they’re not properly sealed, and while a pullover rain jacket gets rid of a big portion of the main zipper on your rain jacket, there are still plenty more zippers and seams to worry about. So if you want to stay dry, you should make sure that these other seams and zippers are properly waterproofed.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – Regardless of how you get your rain jacket on, whether you stay dry or not will come down mostly to what kind of waterproof material is used. Something<!--more--> like Gore Tex, for instance, is well known for being a quality waterproof material. There are other, lesser known fabrics, like eVent, that also do a good job of keeping you dry.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Pullover Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best pullover rain jackets for your consideration.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-pullover-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Pullover</a> - This is a pullover version of Patagonia's popular torrentshell jacket, which is <strong>a cheaper option</strong>, but still a solid waterproof jacket for when it starts raining. It's made with <strong>Patagonia's own H2N0 fabric</strong>, which is a 2.5 layer fabric. It has a <strong>half length zipper, doesn't have any hand warmer pockets</strong>, and even folds up small, in to an attached storage bag. So a good, lightweight and simple option for staying dry. It <strong>weighs a total of 10 ounces, or 283 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828089/arcteryx-alpha-sl-pullover-rain-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx ALpha SL Pullover</a> - The Alpha SL is <strong>made with Gore Tex's 2.5 layer fabric</strong>, called Paclite. So while it's waterproof, it's also very breathable, which is always a nice feature on a rain jacket. It has <strong>a half length zipper, plus a large zippered chest pocket</strong>. It also comes with pit zips and a helmet compatible hood, so there's plenty of excellent options that make this an attractive, if more expensive pullover rain jacket option. It <strong>weighs 13 ounces, or 368 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/salomon-minim-ultimate-pullover-jacket-womens\">Salomon Women's Minim Ultimate Pullover</a> - A <strong>pullover for the women</strong>. It's made with <strong>Salomon's own ClimaPro 2.5L fabric</strong>, which like most other 2.5 layer fabric will keep you dry while also breathing very well. It comes with <strong>a half length zipper, plus a single chest zipper</strong>, but not much else in the way of features. But at <strong>5.2 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>, it's Salomon's lightest waterproof jacket, and a great option if you want something basic and minimalist.</li>

Coffee is easy enough to make in your kitchen at home, but even simple things like boiling water are a little more complicated when you’re camping. Still, you have a few choices when it comes to picking out a <strong>coffee maker for camping</strong>. Many are small enough and lightweight enough that you will hardly even notice you’re carrying them.
<h2>Coffee Maker for Camping</h2>
What to look for when you want a good coffee maker for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Method</strong> – There’s more than one way to make coffee, and the same is true for making coffee in the outdoors. If you prefer a French press for making coffee, there’s a camping option for you. The same goes for drip coffee. Just because you’re in the outdoors, doesn’t mean you have to rough it.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – There are many different ways to make coffee in the outdoors, as stated above, but some are definitely lighter than others. If you’re going to be carrying your camping<!--more--> gear, and not just car camping, then you will want a coffee maker for camping that is small and lightweight, so that you don’t feel weighted down by it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Coffee Maker for Camping</h2>
Some of the very best coffee makers for camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snow Peak Coffee Drip</a> - If you prefer drip coffee, then this option from Snow Peak will do a great job. It's <strong>all stainless steel</strong>, and has <strong>a few legs that fold and will fit on top of just about any coffee cup</strong>, so that your coffee makes itself while you are free to do other things. And when you don't need it, the whole thing <strong>folds down flat for easy storage</strong>. It weighs <strong>4.9 ounces, which is 139 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee and Tea Filter</a> - If you want the <strong>lightest, simplest option</strong> for making coffee while camping, the MugMate is it. Simplicity of use was a big part of why it <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>. Tea drinkers will be familiar with it's design because it's basically just a immersion tea filter, though with smaller, finer screens to keep coffee grounds inside the filter. It's also <strong>rather easy to clean, completely reusable, and weighs just 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>. An ideal solution to making coffee while camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - Some people insist on nothing but french pressed coffee, and if that is you, there is a great camping option for that in the Cafe Press from Snow Peak. It's a <strong>combination of press and pot</strong>, the pot being big enough to <strong>make about 2 cups of coffee</strong> and also <strong>doubling as a cooking pot in a pinch</strong>. If you want a camping coffee press, this is the best option. It also helps that the whole set, being titanium, weighs a very impressive <strong>6.3 ounces, or 179 grams</strong>.</li>

The site has been becoming steadily more popular, and I have been getting a lot of great email from people who like the site, and I'm hoping I can channel some of that in to the new blog.

The blog portion is going to be about all kinds of things related to backpacking, but mostly gear, as that has always been the major focus of Ten Pound Backpack. The gear lists were the first thing that I built on this site, and they have always been the main focus. I find them useful, and a lot of you seem to too, so they will continue to be the main focus of the website.

Finally, this isn't the only change coming. I'll be making a few more minor changes to the front page, but will also be updating the lists with a bunch of new manufacturers and new products. Sometime in the future I'll also be adding a few new columns to the lists that have been suggested by readers. Hopefully the new columns will make the lists more useful to everyone.

And if you are looking for the old front page you can find it by clicking on Articles up top, underneath the logo.

Also, if you see anything glaringly wrong with the new design, please let me know through the contact link in the main menu. I've tested it out in a few different browsers and I cant see anything obvious that I've messed up, but I ended up doing quite a bit of fiddling to make it look pretty, and there's the chance that I've broken something.

Anyway, I hope everyone enjoys the new site."

<h3><strong>Campsaver</strong></h3>
Some of the best black friday sales on at Campsaver seem to be on sleeping pads. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a>, for instance, which is a fantastic sleeping pad, very comfortable, is 25% off. There are also a couple <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sim-comfort-sleeping-pad\">Exped</a> <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sim-light-basic-2-5-m-sleeping-pad\">sleeping pads</a> on sale. Besides sleeeping pads, however, there are a whole bunch of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/door-busters\">Black Friday Door Busters</a>, as well as over <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/\">20,000 items site wide</a> on sale for some amount. Definitely worth checking out.
<h3><strong>REI</strong></h3>
<a href=\"http://www.rei.com\">REI</a> seems to be running the same sale from November 18th through to the 28th, so if you haven't already checked it out the sales might be a little picked through by now. One thing you should definitely check out, however, is the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/winter-sale-daily-deal\">daily deal</a> they are running. For the 25th it's the REI Half Dome 2 Tent, but there's no telling what it will be tomorrow, so check back to see what goes on sale.
<h3><strong>Backcountry</strong></h3>
Backcountry has a grand total of <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/store/dc/1502/Backcountry-2011-Black-Friday-Sale.html\">17,000+ items on sale for black friday</a>. Lots of good deals to be had, but one of the most surprising items I found was a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/necky-looksha-12-si-kayak\">few</a> <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/necky-vector-13-kayak-with-rudder\">kayaks</a> with a decent amount taken off. Kayaks are expensive, and though they are out of season at the moment for most of us it might not be a bad idea to grab them now for summer. But even if kayaks aren't up your alley, definitely check the thousands of other items on sale."

A <strong>backpacking hammock</strong> has a couple of things going for it that make it a good option for backpackers. One is that hammocks keep you up off the ground, so you never have to worry about puddles and other forms of groundwater. They're also rather comfortable, and will help you get a great night of sleep.
<h2>Backpacking Hammock</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for backpacking hammocks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trees -</strong> It must be said that if you are going backpacking in a place with little or no trees, a backpacking hammock is probably not the smartest piece of gear<!--more--> to take with you. It's not impossible to rig up a hammock in such places, but you will have a lot easier time of it in a well forested area.</li>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight -</strong> If you're somewhere around the average weight then you don't have much to worry about, but if you are a big man or woman, you might want to pay attention to the maximum weight of the hammocks you are reviewing. The last thing you want is to get woken up in the middle of the night with a short fall to the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Hammock</h2>
The very best hammocks for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-singlenest-hammock\">Eagles Nest Outfitters SingleNest Hammock</a> - The SingleNest is a great backpacking hammock for the larger among us. It <strong>holds a full 400 pounds of weight</strong>, which is significantly more than most other backpacking hammocks. Keep in mind that this is just a hammock, and <strong>doesn't include a rainfly or hanging system</strong>, which you will need to get separately. It <strong>weighs 18 ounces, or 510 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight</a> - The Explorer Ultralight is a great hammock for beginners, because it <strong>includes a hammock, hanging system and rainfly, all in one</strong>. The hammock even as a<strong> built in no-see-um netting</strong>, to keep the bugs at bay. You can also enter the Explorer Ultralight from the bottom, which then closes behind you, making entry and exit that much easier. It's good for those <strong>250 pounds and below</strong>, and the whole system <strong>weighs 2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>. A great backpacking hammock for anyone new to hammocks.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-travel-hammock\">Grand Trunk Ultra-light Travel Hammock</a> - The Travel Hammock from Grand Trunk is an ideal hammock for backpacking. It <strong>weighs a mere 12 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>, and that is for just the hammock, and no hanging system or rainfly. It also <strong>holds up to 250 pounds</strong>. The impressive thing about this backpacking hammock, however, is the price, which is <strong>about $20 to $30</strong>, depending on the retailer and the options.  A great deal for a hammock.</li>

A good <strong>Goretex rain jacket</strong> will keep you dry when other materials fail. Goretex does often cost quite a bit more than other waterproof materials, but then quality materials tend to be more expensive. You wallet wont thank you for the a Goretex jacket, but you’ll be thankful when it’s the third hours of a rain storm and you’re still dry.
<h2>Goretex Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a Goretex rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Goretex</strong> – There are a few different kinds of Goretex, and you need to decide on which one you want. Something like 3L Pro is a heavy, 3 layer Goretex that will do an excellent job of keeping you dry. Something like Paclite, however, is a 2.5 layer Goretex that will keep you dry, but will breath better, and pack down smaller too.</li>
	<li><strong>Zippers and Seams</strong> – So the material that your jacket is made out of is waterproof, but what <!--more-->about the seams and the zippers. Manufacturers sometimes cut corners, making their seams and zippers just water resistant, and then these areas end up leaking, while everything else stays dry. So pay attention to just how waterproof the seams and zippers are.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Goretex Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best Goretex rain jacket for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Goretex Rain Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754256/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> - If you want the best, then the Alpha SV is likely it. It uses the<strong> high quality 3L Pro Goretex fabric</strong>, which will definitely keep you dry for those prolonged rain storms. It has all the essentials, like zippered hand pockets and underarm zippered ventilation, plus a good <strong>hood that is helmet compatible</strong>. It also has a few great design features, like a <strong>minimal amount of seams. The seams are also laminated</strong>, rather than taped, to really keep the water out. This is a high quality Goretex rain jacket that will work well no matter what you're doing in it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> - At the other end of the spectrum is something like the Minimalist from Marmot. It's quite a bit cheaper than the Arc'teryx jacket, in part because it <strong>uses the 2.5 layer Paclite, which is a more breathable version of Goretex</strong>. It also lacks much in the way of features, besides the basics like zippered hand pockets and pit zips. It really does live up to its Minimalist name. So definitely a quality Goretex jacket, but lacking a lot of bells and whistles.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Goretex Rain Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779570/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> - Price is sometimes not indicative of quality, but with Arc'teryx jackets the high price really does reflect quality materials and thoughtful design. For starters, this jacket uses the <strong>top of the line Goretex 3L Pro</strong>, which will definitely keep you dry. And things like minimal seams that are laminated, rather than taped, an <strong>extra few inches to bring the jacket down over the hip, and a helmet compatible hood</strong> all point out just how much thought went in to the design of the Alpha SV. Of course it also has all the basics, like a few zippered pockets and underarm zippers to keep you ventilated when working hard.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> - The Minimalist sits on the opposite end of the spectrum from the Alpha SV. It's quite a bit cheaper, for starters, and uses <strong>Goretex Paclite, which is the more breathable, 2.5 layer version of Goretex</strong>. And while it has the essentials that you would expect, like pit zips and zippered pockets for your hand plus one on the chest, the focus with this jacket is <strong>small, lightweight minimalist design</strong>. Less is more.</li>

Most camping utensil sets come with either a way to attach all of the pieces of the set together, so that you can be sure you wont lose any, or else are attached, often with a loop around the end of all of them, so that you don’t lose any. That convenience is part of what makes a camping utensil set such a good option.
<h2>Camping Knife Set</h2>
What to look for when you want a new camping knife set.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Spork</strong> – Many utensil sets come with a separate spoon and fork, but a spork is a classic, and an easy way to save on some weight and bulk, and some money too. Some manufacturers also give you a combo unit that has a spoon on one end and a fork on the other, so that you just switch ends depending on the utensil you need.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Camping knifes sets come in a few different materials. Plastic is a fairly popular option, but is lacking in some <!--more-->ways, such as durability. Something like titanium, however, will be extremely lightweight, and also strong. Any metal will also work a lot better around heat than plastic will.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Knife Set</h2>
Some of the very best camping knife sets that you have to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-silverware-set\">Snow Peak Titanium Silverware Set</a> - A fantastic <strong>set of knife, fork and spoon</strong> from Snow Peak. It's<strong> titanium</strong>, as the name suggests, which means it weighs very little, at just <strong>1.8 ounces, or 51 ounces</strong> for the whole set. Titanium is ideal because it is strong, and lightweight as you can see, but will also not corrode over time. The set also comes with a handy little carrying case, so you don't lose anything in your backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/primus-stainless-field-cutlery-kit\">Primus Stainless Field Cutlery Kit</a> - If you would prefer the lower cost of a <strong>stainless steel set</strong> then Primus has a good option here. It is a <strong>fork, spoon and knife set</strong>, and comes with a handy little length of rope to hold the whole thing together. There are actually holes punched in to the handles of each piece, so that they have <strong>just a skeleton frame</strong>. This helps lower the weight down to a very impressive <strong>3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/792158/sea-to-summit-alpha-light-spork-and-knife-set\">Sea to Summit Alpha Lit Knife Set</a> - If you really want lightweight, then this is the set for you. It's <strong>just a spork and knife set</strong>, and comes with a tiny little carabiner to hold the set together so you don't lose anything. The set is actually <strong>made of a hard anodized aluminum alloy</strong>, so that you get the lightness and value of aluminum without sacrificing much in terms of strength. And at just <strong>.5 ounces, or 14 grams</strong> for the whole set, you wont do much better than this.</li>

Mummy sleeping bags are smaller, and thus weigh less and pack down smaller, which makes them ideal for backpackers. But even a semi-rectangular cut sleeping bag gives you enough room to move around at night, which some people need to get a good night of sleep.
<h2>Rectangular Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when you're looking at rectangular sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – If you’re getting a rectangular cut sleeping bag because you’re not planning on having to carry it anywhere, then a synthetic sleeping bag would likely be a better choice, because it’s generally a cheaper option. But if you’re going to be carrying that sleeping bag, down is a better option because it weighs less, relative to warmth, and compresses better than synthetic.</li>
	<li><strong>Semi-Rectangular</strong> – Mummy and Rectangular are not your only two options when it comes to sleeping bag shapes. There <!--more-->is actually a wide variety of sleeping bag that fall somewhere in between the two, and if you don’t specifically need a rectangular sleeping bag, a semi-rectangular sleeping bag might be worth considering.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rectangular Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best rectangular sleeping bags, at a few different temperature points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/830941/sea-to-summit-trek-tkii-sleeping-bag\">Sea to Summit Trek TkII</a> - With a low <strong>minimum temperature of 18 degrees, this is an ideal choice for four season camping</strong>, where you need something warm. It's a <strong>semi-rectangular shape</strong>, so it's slightly tapered, but still rectangular enough that you will have plenty of room inside to move around. It also uses <strong>650 fill duck down, not goose down</strong>, and has a full length zipper, plus a footbox zipper, so that you can turn it in to a comforter for summer camping, for example. The whole thing also <strong>weighs just 2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>, which is a great weight for the temperature rating.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gunn-creek-30-sleeping-bag-synthetic\">Big Agnes Gunn Creek</a> - The Gunn Creek is a<strong> fairly basic three season camping sleeping bag</strong> ideal for someone who doesn't want anything too technical. It has <strong>just a slight taper</strong>, and is almost entirely rectangular. It also uses <strong>synthetic Climashield HL insulation</strong>, and is <strong>warm down to 30 degrees. It weighs 2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.27 kilograms</strong>, which is more, you'll notice, than the warmer Trek above. This is also a cheaper option, however, and a good choice if you're not looking to do any serious camping or backpacking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-yampa-sleeping-bag-45-degree-down\">Big Agnes Yampa</a> - With a minimum <strong>temperature rating of just 45 degrees</strong>, this is a sleeping bag ideally suited to warm summer nights, but not fall or spring weather, unless you live somewhere very warm. It <strong>doesn't have a hood</strong>, but when the temperature is that warm you don't really need one. It does have a pillow insert, however, and is filled with <strong>650 fill down</strong>, which will keep you nice and warm. The whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 13 ounces, or 822 grams</strong>.</li>

Whether you’re just a day hiker looking to take a few important items, or a hiker doing a more ambitious weekend trip, for instance, a small backpack can be ideal. Many hikers, backpackers and campers end up taking far more gear than they need, which results in large, bloated backpacks. By taking only the essentials you can both lighten your load and get rid of the need for a big, heavy backpack.
<h2>Small Hiking Backpack</h2>
What to look for when you’re looking at small hiking backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – A small hiking backpack is great, but you want to make sure that you don’t get something that’s too small. Think hard about what you will and wont be bringing with you hiking, and don’t forget about things like food and water, which can take up quite a lot of space and increase and decrease quite a lot, depending on conditions and the length of the trip.</li>
	<li><strong>Frame</strong> – When you get in to smaller hiking backpacks it’s a good idea to ask yourself if you need a frame or not. With a total weight of less than 25 or 30 pounds, you can make do without a frame, provided you do a good job of packing. One <!--more-->bonus of getting a backpack without a frame is that frames weigh a lot, and leaving the frame at home lowers your weight. Keep in mind that some backpacks come with a removable frame, which gives you more versatility.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Small Hiking Backpack</h2>
Some of the better small hiking backpacks on the market right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam Backpack</a> - When it comes to small hiking backpacks, the Jam is a rather popular choice. With a <strong>capacity of 50 liters</strong> it's not so big that it cant be used as a day pack, but still gives you enough room for a whole weekend worth of gear, and lightweight backpackers could get a full weeks worth of gear in without too many problems. The hip belt and sternum strap are welcome additions for longer distances, and the <strong>hydration bladder and hip belt pockets</strong> mean that you don't have to take the backpack off for the important stuff. With <strong>no frame</strong>, and a <strong>weight of just 1.73 pounds or 788 grams</strong>, this is a great backpack choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - Another backpack that occupies the space between big day day pack and small week pack is the CDT. Like the Jam it comes with <strong>no frame, hip belt pockets and a hydration pack</strong>, all feature which make it easy to stay fast and light. Features like an <strong>extending roll top closure and ample space in exterior pockets</strong> make this a great backpack for lightweight backpackers who do a little day hiking on the side. It <strong>weighs a total of 17 ounces, which is 482 grams</strong> and gives you <strong>55 Liters of capacity</strong> to work with..</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780219/osprey-exos-46-pack\">Osprey Exos 46</a> - Something slightly smaller that's probably limited to just day trips and maybe an overnight adventure or two is the Exos. This is a little more sturdy, with an <strong>aluminum frame and back ventilation system</strong>. This backpack also features <strong>hip belt pockets and a convenient place for a water bladder</strong>,which is ideal for those that don't want to slow down. It <strong>weighs 2.31 pounds, or 1.05 kilograms</strong>, which is more than either of the backpacks above.</li>

The <strong>lightest trekking poles</strong> are a great thing to have, however, because they cut down on a lot of arm and shoulder fatigue that can result from using trekking poles all day long. Trekking poles are meant to cut down on the amount of weight the knees take on, but you’re not doing yourself any favors by transferring that fatigue from your knees right to your arms and shoulders.
<h2>Lightest Trekking Poles</h2>
What to look for when what you want is the lightest trekking poles available.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – One of the more important things to consider when trying to find the lightest trekking poles possible is the material they’re made from. Aluminum is the more popular material for trekking poles, but carbon fiber is lighter. It’s also more expensive, which is something you’ll have to consider.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed Length</strong> – Most trekking poles are adjustable, so you order one pair and then adjust their length to your height. But <!--more-->all that extra stuff that enables you to adjust their length is extra weight, and if you order a pair of trekking poles that are fixed in their length, you save a lot of weight from leaving all that extra stuff off of the poles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Lightest Trekking Poles</h2>
Some of the very best of the lightest trekking poles.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-ultra-distance-trekking-pole\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Trekking Poles</a> - When it comes to trekking poles there are very few lighter than the Ultra Distance poles from Black Diamond. And it helps that they <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, highlighting them as a very high quality trekking pole as well. They're <strong>carbon, and fixed length</strong>, though they do <strong>fold down, in the same way that tent poles do</strong>, making them easy to pack away when you're not using them. As for weight, they're a mere <strong>9.2 ounces, or 260 grams</strong> for the medium length. They also come in an <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-distance-trekking-pole\">aluminum version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/carbonlite-aergon-as-trekking-poles\">Leki Carbonlite Aergon Speedlock Trekking Poles</a> - If you want the fully <strong>adjustable kind of trekking poles</strong>, these are some of the lightest that you will find. They're <strong>three sections of carbon fiber</strong>, with easy to use speed locks that will adjust to a length of anywhere from 26.3 to 53 inches. As for weight, they're a very respectable <strong>14.6 ounces, or 413 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813392/black-diamond-distance-fl-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\">Black Diamond Distance FL Z-Poles</a> - The FL Z-Poles are an interesting mix of features. They're <strong>aluminum, and fold down, tent pole style</strong>, like the Ultra Distance poles above. They're not fixed length, however, each of the sizes is <strong>adjustable by a total of 20 centimeters, or 7.8 inches</strong>. So a great mix of fixed length weight saving and adjustable sizing. The smaller of the two sizes <strong>weighs 15.7 ounces, or 445 grams</strong>, which is impressive considering they're aluminum and adjustable.</li>

But sometimes you need something that will handle conditions that range beyond safe and predictable. Gear like <strong>extreme sleeping bags</strong> are the perfect solution to unpredictable conditions. After all, at the end of the day you need to stay warm, no matter what, even in the very worst of weather conditions.
<h2>Extreme Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when shopping for extreme sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – If you’re getting an extreme sleeping bag it’s best to get one with a temperature rating well below what you’re expecting. That way, even if the temperature dips down farther than you were expecting you will still manage to stay warm and comfortable.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – In extreme weather things often get wet, but the last thing you want getting wet is the <!--more-->insulation inside your sleeping bag. Wet sleeping bag insulation, particularly when it’s down, doesn’t do a very good job of keeping you warm, so it’s a good idea to get a sleeping bag with a water resistant exterior, if not a waterproof exterior.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Extreme Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the better extreme sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - First up, a great sleeping bag from Mont Bell with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, which makes it a good 4 season sleeping bag for milder winters. It uses a <strong>water resistant exterior</strong>, to keep water out, and <strong>800+ fill down</strong>. What helps to make it ideal for extreme situations is Mont Bell's unique construction technique, where the <strong>baffles are all cut on a 45 degree angle</strong>, and will coil and squeeze around you at night as you move, increasing the warmth. It also weighs a very <strong>slim 2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-phantom-sleeping-bag-0-degree-down\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom 0</a> - For colder temperatures, the Phantom, which has a <strong>temperature rating of 0 degrees</strong>, is a great choice. What helps to make it ideal for extreme weather is the <strong>very narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>, which minimizes excess internal space, without being too cramped. So your body heat is heating as small a space as possible. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and is not water resistant, but does weigh very little, at just <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795904/marmot-cwm-eq-40-sleeping-bag\">Marmot CWM EQ -40</a> - If you want to be prepared for truly extreme weather conditions, then there are few sleeping bags better than the CWM. It will keep you <strong>warm all the way down to -40</strong>, and uses a <strong>fully waterproof shell to keep the 800+ fill down dry</strong>. Given its temperature rating it's not the lightest sleeping bag around, but <strong>4 pounds 10 ounces, or 2.09 kilograms</strong> is a small price to pay for staying warm all the way down to -40.</li>

A good <strong>alcohol backpacking stove</strong> has several clear advantages over something like a canister stove. One of the most obvious advantages is that the fuel itself is a lot easier to store, transport and obtain. An alcohol backpacking stove also tends to weigh quite a bit less than the average canister stove or liquid fuel stove, though there are certainly a few exceptions to that.
<h2>Alcohol Backpacking Stove</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for an alcohol backpacking stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fuel Alternatives</strong> – Many alcohol stoves give you the option of using other, alternative fuel sources, which can be great if you run out of alcohol, for instance. Alcohol stoves that can also run on wood, for instance, are great because there is a ready amount of wood at most campsites that will give you a working stove in a pinch.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As with any backpacking equipment, the weight of the alcohol backpacking stove should definitely be a concern. Fortunately, alcohol stoves are<!--more--> often designed with weight in mind, and it is not too difficult to find a lightweight alcohol backpacking stove to take on your next backpacking trip.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Alcohol Backpacking Stove</h2>
Some of the best alcohol backpacking stoves to take along on your next trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ii-alcohol-stove\">Etowah II Alcohol Stove</a> - The Etowah alcohol stove got it's start with long distance backpackers along the Appalachian trail, but it's popular with a wide range of campers and backpackers today. It's very easy to use, and is <strong>a good, stable design with a wide enough pot support radius</strong> that you don't have to worry about spilling anything. It even <strong>comes with a windscreen and a fuel bottle</strong>, and weighs a very slight <strong>4.5 ounces, which is 127 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove</a> - The DX is a great stove for burning alcohol while backpacking, because <strong>in addition to alcohol it also burns wood</strong>. So if you are unfortunate enough to run out of alcohol, you can always just use wood, which is convenient considering how much wood is lying around most campsites. It's also <strong>relatively large, and therefore stable, but weighs just 3 ounces, or 86 grams, since it's made from titanium</strong>. So an excellent alcohol backpacking stove if you want a backup fuel option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/657906/trangia-mini-trangia-28-t-backpacking-stove\">Trangia Mini Trangia 28-T</a> - This is actually a <strong>whole cooking set that includes the burner and stand itself, plus a windscreen, aluminum pot, pot lid that doubles as a frying pan and even a pot lifter</strong>. And for everything you get the price is very reasonable. So if you want an alcohol stove and don't have any other cookware yet, this might be an excellent option. The burner, stand and windscreen weigh a total of <strong>5.75 ounces, or 163 grams</strong>.</li>

Winter camping can be a lot of fun, but the big hurdle for winter camping is always gear. There are a few purchases, like good winter boots, that you cant really avoid, but there are a few winter camping gear items that can be improvised from the gear you have, and maybe a few cheap addons.
<h2>Winter Sleeping Bags</h2>
<a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter sleeping bags</a> are one of the most important items in any winter camping gear list. No matter how great the scenery is, if you're shivering all night you are definitely not having any fun. There are, however, a few good ways to improvise a winter sleeping bag out of a summer sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sleeping Bag Liner</strong> - A sleeping bag liner is the perfect item to add a few degrees of warmth to a sleeping bag. <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/warm-up-sheets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell</a> makes a good one, but there are plenty out there to choose from. Just be sure to read reviews before buying, because the warmth added can vary quite a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Sleeping Pad</strong> - Another way to boost the temperature rating of your sleeping bag for winter conditions is to get a good sleeping pad. Buying a new sleeping pad, after all, will be a lot cheaper than buying a winter sleeping bag. Exped makes a great winter sleeping pad, called the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780365/exped-downmat-9-sleeping-pad-with-pump\" rel=\"nofollow\">Downmat 9</a>, but there are plenty to choose from. When buying a winter sleeping pad, the thing you want to pay attention to is the R-value of the sleeping pad. The higher the R-value is, the warmer that sleeping pad will be. (The <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">sleeping pads comparison list</a> lets you rank sleeping pads by R-value)</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - Another good way to improve<!--more--> the warmth of your sleeping bag is to wear your insulating layers to bed. The more material there is between you and the outer air, the better, and a good fleece layer, or even better, down, can keep you warm and toasty inside a summer sleeping bag during winter weather.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Winter Tents</h2>
[caption id=\"attachment_1114\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"300\" caption=\"From {link:http://www.flickr.com/photos/8785371@N07/}John M{/link}\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1114\" style=\"border-width: 1px; border-color: black; border-style: solid; margin: 3px;\" title=\"winter tarp tent\" src=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/winter-tarp-tent-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"winter tarp tent\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />[/caption]

The other big item for winter campers that can be improvised is a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">winter tent</a>. And the way you do that is location.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shallows</strong> - It's always best to avoid shallows when winter camping. Cold air will settle in them, and make the temperature there several degrees cooler than the surrounding area.</li>
	<li><strong>Shelter</strong> - Try, whenever possible, to avoid pitching your tent out in the open. This will both keep you a few degrees warmer, and keep you out of any winter winds that pick up. As someone who has slept through a wind storm in a flattened tent, I can tell you that winter wind storms are nothing to mess around with. Wind is one of the big dangers to flimsier, summer tents, and you want to do everything you can to avoid pitching a tent out in the open when you take a summer tent out in winter conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Trenches</strong> - Of course, there's no reason you even need to bring a tent. For the brave, there is always the option to leave your tent at home and take a tarp with you. This will definitely save on weight. The right way to go about this is to dig a trench, similar to the one in the picture. The trench keeps you out of the wind, while the tarp provides shelter from above. Just be sure that you know what you're doing with this kind of set up.</li>

I have a cotton / silk liner that I use sometimes during the summer for my own sleeping bag, more because I don't like the feeling of nylon when sleeping. But even a cotton liner adds a couple degrees of warmth.

A fleece sleeping bag liner or a liner made out of any fabric does help to keep the inside of your sleeping bag clean too. It's not the most lightweight option, but it really does help, and some liner materials, like silk, are extremely light.
<h2>Fleece Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
Here are a couple of examples of fleece sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/kelty-lightweight-fleece-sleeping-bag-liner\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kelty Fleece Liner</a> - This is a rectangular sleeping bag liner, which would, obviously fit a rectangular sleeping bag. It has a drawstring closure on top, which is a good feature to look out for because you can draw it closed around your neck and keep the warmth in. It doesn't have a hood, however, and unless you don't mind wearing a toque to bed, a hood is a good feature to have. It adds about 10 to 15 degrees of warmth.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/toaster-microfleece-mummy-liner\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit Toaster Microfleece</a>- This is a mummy shaped fleece sleeping bag liner from Sea to Summit. This one comes with<!--more--> a drawstring hood as well as a hood, so a better option than the Kelty liner. It doesn't state temperature boost range, but it's probably around 10 to 15 degrees. Weight is 560 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/705534/sea-to-summit-reactor-thermolite-mummy-bag-liner\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit Reactor Thermolite Liner</a> - This is not a fleece liner, it's made out of Thermolite. It does, however, add 15 degrees to your sleeping bag and weighs just 230 grams. So half the weight of the Toaster Fleece above, but roughly the same temperature boost.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/649745/cocoon-coolmax-mummy-liner\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cocoon Coolmax Mummy Liner</a> - Coolmax is another alternative to fleece. It's a popular material for a lot of backpacking and hiking clothing. The liner weighs 255 grams and adds 8 degrees of warmth, so it's not comparable to Thermolite or fleece. That said, I believe Coolmax would be a more breathable material, and might be a better choice for someone looking for breathability.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Of course a fleece sleeping bag liner isn't the only way to add warmth to a sleeping bag.</strong> A trick that a lot of lightweight backpackers use is to wear a few insulating layers to bed. Why bring along a fleece sleeping bag liner, after all, when you have a fleece sweater with you?

Of course the sweater doesn't have to be fleece, in fact a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-light-down-parka-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down sweater / jacket</a> would probably be a better option. Down is what most good, lightweight sleeping bags are made out of, after all, and you will get more warmth for less weight with a down garment.

That highlights one thing that you should always be looking for, which is dual-use items. A sleeping bag liner is only good for lining your sleeping bag, but a sweater and pants combo work to keep you warm in your sleeping bag and around camp too."

The big hole in a lot of people's winter backpacking gear is a good <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">winter sleeping bag</a>.

Of course plenty of insulation is only one important thing for a winter sleeping bag to have. Depending on where you are heading it might be a good idea to take <strong>waterproof sleeping bag</strong> with you, or at least a method of making your sleeping bag waterproof.
<h2>Waterproof Sleeping Bag</h2>
Here are a few good waterproof sleeping bags to consider if you are in the market for one.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795901/marmot-col-membrain-20-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Col Membrain</a> - This is one of several waterproof sleeping bags that Marmot makes, all under the name Membrain. This particular model uses 800+ fill down to get down to a -20 temperature rating. The weight is about 1770 grams, which works out to 3.9 pounds, which is not all that lightweight. But then not much at the -20 mark is going to be lightweight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/waterbloc-1200-sleeping-bag-750-down\">Exped Waterbloc 1200</a> - Exped is well known for making<!--more--> a lot of really excellent sleeping pads, but they do a few other products, including sleeping bags. This particular sleeping bag is indeed waterproof, and is good down to the -20 as well. The weight, however, is 2280 grams, or 5 pounds, so not very lightweight either.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-puma-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-25-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Puma Gore WS</a> - Western Mountaineering makes a lot of very lightweight sleeping bags, and they come through in that regard with the Puma Gore. The weight is a mere 1644 grams, or 3.6 pounds, and the temperature rating is -25. The sleeping bag is only \"weather-resistant\" however, whereas the marketing for the other two sleeping bags is \"waterproof.\" How much truth there is to any of these claims is very debatable. I don't think you would want to be caught out in a rainstorm in any of them.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-bivy-bags/\">Lightweight Bivy bag</a> - Of course if you really want a waterproof sleeping bag, your best choice is always going to be a bivy bag. There are some great bivy bags on the market that weigh next to nothing, and will keep you dry even in that rain storm (see the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/bivy-bags/\">compare bivy bags list</a>).</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">Sleeping Bags List</a> - You can find plenty more sleeping bags over at the compare sleeping bags list if none of these fit your needs.</li>
</ul>
No discussion of waterproof sleeping bags would be complete without at least a quick discussion of sleeping bag insulation. There are two main insulation categories that you will find on sleeping bags. One is synthetic, or man-made insulation, and the other is down, usually goose down.

Synthetic insulation is the one you want if you plan on getting wet. It weighs more, on average, than down does, but it retains a lot of its insulating properties when wet. So while your backpack will end up weighing more, you want have to obsess over keeping your sleeping bag.

The other choice, down, is typically lighter than synthetic sleeping bags. The trade off is that if you get down wet you are going to be cold until you manage to dry your sleeping off, which can be next to impossible on a winter backpacking trip.

Of course you don't want to get either kind of sleeping bag wet, which is where a waterproof sleeping bag can pay off. If you don't want to spring for an expensive waterproof sleeping bag, however, a good, waterproof bivi bag is the best backup option."

Of course if you do plan on venturing out in to the wilderness in winter, it helps to have the right gear, and there are many <strong>winter tents for camping</strong> that are ideal for such conditions.
<h2>Winter Tents for Camping</h2>
A winter tent for camping will have a few things to look for.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Low Profile -</strong> It really depends on what kind of weather you plan to go in to, but a big part of winter weather in most areas is wind, and when the wind starts you want a tent with a low profile. As someone who has spent a night in a collapsed tent, I can tell you that wind can ruin a good tent quickly. Related to a low profile, you want a tent with a good pole structure, so that it wont easily collapse.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> You probably always want a waterproof tent, regardless of the season, but this is especially true in winter, when snow and rain storms <!--more-->can dump a lot of moisture on you in a short amount of time. Often, this can actually mean using a single wall tent instead of a double wall tent. This works, however, only if you handle ventilation properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Examples of Winter Tents for Camping</h2>
Here are a few winter tents suitable for camping, though you will find a lot more over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">compare tents</a> page.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dragontail-tent-2-person-4-season\">MSR Dragontail</a> - This is a winter tent unlike many other winter tents. It has a unique, ribbed design that makes it a very roomy tent. The ribbed design also gives the Dragontail a lot of strength as well, and makes it an ideal tent for weathering a winter storm. It's a <strong>two person tent</strong>, and weighs <strong>4 pounds 6 ounces, or 1.99 kilograms</strong>, so it's not the lightest tent in the world, but decently light for a winter tent, and that extra weight will keep you dry. Plus the extra room is a nice touch if you want it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-ev-2-tent-2-person-4-season-mhw1045\">Mountain Hardwear EV 2 Tent</a> - This is an ideal winter tent. It's the one pictured up above, and as you can see it has a lot of things going for it that make it ideal. The <strong>low profile, guy-lines and ample amount of poles</strong> means that you wont ever have to worry about a windstorm collapsing the sides on you. It <strong>sleeps two, and weighs 5 pounds 2 ounces, which is 2.32 kilograms</strong>, which is, again, relatively light for a solid winter tent that sleeps two. It also comes in a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-ev-3-tent-3-person-4-season-mhw1048\">3-person size</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795544/the-north-face-mountain-25-tent\">North Face Mountain 25 Tent</a> - This offering from the North Face is another good option for those looking for a winter tent. It has a <strong>low profile and good pole structure</strong> to ensure that you don't have a tent hitting you in the face all night long. It has a couple good features, but it sleeps two and weighs <strong>8 pounds 8 ounces, or 3.86 kilograms</strong>, so significantly more than the other two winter tents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>No Winter Tent? No Problem</h2>
Winter tents are expensive, and if you don't have one, and cant afford to buy a new one, there are alternatives. <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-camping-in-winter/\">Tarp camping in winter</a>, for example, is definitely a viable option if you have the right skills and expertise to pull it off. And even if you don't have a tarp, a new tarp is a lot cheaper than a new winter tent.

You can always make do with a regular tent, though like the tarp camping, this takes a little knowledge to pull off. First, you will want to make sure your tent is good and waterproof. This is one area that you really need to be sure of when winter camping. If you are confident in your tent's waterproofing, then what it comes down to is picking the right campsite.

If you can find a campsite that is sheltered enough that you will be out of the wind, there is no reason that a 3 season tent cant get the job done. But it is a risk. As I mentioned before, I've had to sleep through a windstorm in a tent that collapsed, and it sucks. It also ruined the tent poles, and made the remaining nights quite an adventure. So if you are going to take a 3 season tent when you should be taking a 4 season tent, be sure that you can get away with it.

And as usual, I recommend you check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">compare tents</a> page if you want to see a few more 4 season tents."

And one of the most important pieces of equipment is your shoes. When you go hiking, it pays to have a good pair of hiking shoes. The last thing you want is to have blisters, hot spots and the many other foot problems that hikers experience.
<h2>Hiking Shoes</h2>
Generally, you should look for hiking shoes that have a few things going for them.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Everything else being equal, you want lightweight hiking shoes, rather than heavy hiking shoes. Every pound on your foot is equal to about five pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure, which is something to keep in mind when shopping for hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Ankle Support, or Not -</strong> If you have <!--more-->a heavy backpack, anything over 40 pounds I would say, then you may need to upgrade from hiking shoes to hiking boots, or at least shoes with ankle support. Most hikers don't carry that much weight, however, so it shouldn't be something that you have to worry about.</li>
	<li><strong>Proprioception -</strong> Some people probably wont agree with this one, but I think that proprioception is important. For those that don't know, proprioception is the ability to sense the environment around you. In the case of shoes, it is the ability to sense what is beneath your feet. That feedback can come in handy when you are on unstable or rocky ground, to give just two examples.</li>
	<li><strong>Breathable and Waterproof -</strong> Depending on the season and the weather you expect, these are two very important features of hiking shoes. Unfortunately, the more breathable your shoes are the less waterproof they tend to be, so you will probably end up having to choose one over the other.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Shoes</h2>
Here are a few of the best hiking shoes to give you an idea of what is out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-x-talon-212-trail-running-shoe-mens\">Inov 8 X-Talon 212 Trail Running Shoe</a> - Inov 8 is probably the <strong>best brand of hiking shoe that most people don't know about</strong>. What they do really well is <strong>lightweight trail shoes</strong>, and the X-Talon 212s are a great example of that. They <strong>weigh just 7.5 ounces, or 212 grams, which is very lightweight for a pair of shoes</strong>. They have excellent breathability with the mesh uppers, but will not hold out well against water. The X-Talon 212s also have a great sole, which is <strong>thin enough to allow for good proprioception</strong>. But the bottom line is that with Inov 8, you get lightweight hiking shoes. You can see a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-roclite-268-trail-running-shoe-womens\">similar women's shoe from Inov 8</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818510/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-gtx-trail-running-shoes-mens\">Salomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 GTX Trail-Running Shoes</a> - Salomon is a well known name when it comes to hiking shoes. These particular shoes are a great choice if you are looking for something that is both relatively breathable and waterproof, which is what you get with a <strong>Gore-Tex liner. They weigh 1 pound 12 ounces, or 810 grams</strong>, so you can really see the difference between these and the Inov 8s, but the waterproofing, along with these being a bigger, tougher shoe certainly adds some weight. Here is a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/820493/salomon-xa-comp-6-gtx-trail-running-shoes-womens\">similar women's shoe from Salomon</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-men-s\">Montrail Mountain Masochist Trailrunner</a> - Another very dependable brand when it comes to hiking shoes is Montrail. The Mountain Masochists are a great all around shoe that do well as a footwear choice for hikers. They're <strong>low profile and breath well</strong>, though they still manage to weigh <strong>21 ounces, or 612 grams</strong>, which is not so much a mark against them so much as a demonstration of how ridiculously light the Inov 8s are. But if you are <strong>looking for something breathable and aren't sold on the Inov 8s, the Mountain Masochists are a great option</strong>. You can find the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-women-s\">women's version</a> too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Shoes or Boots</h2>
If you're looking at the shoes listed above and thinking that they all seem a little flimsy for you, you are probably looking more for a boot. Hiking shoes are great if you don't carry too much weight in your backpack when you hike, or if you don't carry a backpack at all, but if you are carrying a lot of weight you probably need the extra support that a boot provides.

Just remember that even if you are wearing boots, they don't have to be heavy boots."

In fact a good <strong>camping sleeping pad</strong> is one of the most important things that you can take camping with you. There is nothing worse, after all, than rolling around all night, unable to sleep because your sleeping pad isn't comfortable enough.
<h2>Camping Sleeping Pad</h2>
Here are the things to look out for in a camping sleeping pad if you want to get a good night's sleep.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Inflatable -</strong> You have one big decision to make when choosing a camping sleeping pad, and that is foam or inflatable. Foam tends to weigh less, but in my experience inflatable is more comfortable. Of course the thicker the foam, the more comfort you will get.</li>
	<li><strong>Wide Enough -</strong> Everyone's width requirements will be different, but the last thing you want is a sleeping pad that is not wide <!--more-->enough, the main reason being that you will fall off in the night. Side sleepers and restless sleepers will likely need a rectangular sleeping pad, for the extra width it provides, while those who go to sleep on their back and wake up in the morning in the same position can get away with a lighter, mummy shaped sleeping pad.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Sleeping Pad</h2>
Here are a few of the best camping sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - If there were a popularity contest for sleeping pads, the Therm-A-Rest NeoAir would win with ease. It won a <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2009</strong>, and has only gotten better since then. It's an <strong>inflatable, rectangular sleeping pad, but weighs just 14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>. When it's fully inflated you get <strong>2.5 inches of width</strong>. For the <strong>side sleepers and the restless</strong>, this is a great camping sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat</a> - Sleeping pads keep you comfortable, but they also keep you warm. The warmth you can expect to get from your sleeping pad is called the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">R-value</a>, and the higher it is, the warmer you will be. The Exped DownMat has a <strong>very impressive R-value of 8</strong>, which makes it a <strong>great winter sleeping pad</strong>. It gets that impressive R-value with a layer of down built in to the top of the sleeping pad. It's also <strong>rectangular, inflatable, and gives you 3.5 inches of thickness</strong>. And all that for <strong>36 ounces, or 1020 grams</strong>, which is extremely lightweight for a winter sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/inertia-x-frame-sleeping-pads\">Klymit Intertia X Frame</a> - The Intertia X Frame has a design that has to be seen to be believed. All the extra material is cut out, and you are left with a <strong>ribbed inflatable sleeping pad</strong> that is padded in all of the right places. The main benefit of this design, of course, is the weight, which is only <strong>257 grams, or 9 ounces</strong>. If you are a sleeper that does not move and you want something lightweight, the Intertia X Frame is ideal.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview</a> - The Clearview is a fairly standard <strong>mummy shaped</strong> sleeping pad from Big Agnes. And while it is not the lightest sleeping pad around, it is <strong>one of the cheapest</strong>, so if you aren't looking to spend a lot, the Clearview is ideal. It weighs <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams, and is 2.5 inches thick</strong> when inflated.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-3-4.html\">Gossamer Gear Nightlight Sleeping Pad</a> - There aren't too many <strong>foam sleeping pads</strong> on the market to choose from, but the Nightlight from Gossamer Gear is one of the best. It has an <strong>egg crate design</strong>, and weighs in at <strong>12 ounces, or 345 grams</strong>. One thing to be aware of is that it is only <strong>3/4 length</strong>, so either your feet or your head will be hanging off one end, unless you happen to be especially short. It's <strong>.75 inches thick</strong>, and Gossamer gear has a number of other, thinner foam sleeping pads to choose from as well.</li>

If you are too hot, you can unzip the bag, and similarly if you're too cold you can start wearing your clothes, but this only works up to a point. And buying a new sleeping for every different temperature that you go camping or backpacking in just is not very practical. <strong>Sleeping bag liners</strong>, however, go a long ways towards solving the problem.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
Features to look out for when shopping for sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Fabric -</strong> There are a wide variety of materials to choose from when shopping for a sleeping bag liner. Various materials like cotton, silk, fleece and thermolite all have positives and negatives, and the right fabric will depend on what you want your sleeping bag liner to do.</li>
	<li><strong>Warmth Added -</strong> Another thing to pay close attention to is the warmth that you can expect to get <!--more-->from your sleeping bag liner. Most liners will tell you, but many will not.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood -</strong> Some liners come with hoods, and some don't. Your head is one of the main areas that you lose heat from, and so having a liner that extends up to your sleeping bag hood can be helpful for keeping your body heat in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Bag Liners</h2>
A few of the very best sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708744/cocoon-silk-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Silk Mummy Liner</a> - Silk makes a great sleeping bag liner material. It adds a small amount of warmth, doesn't weigh much and <strong>feels great to sleep in</strong>. This particular liner made by Cocoon <strong>adds about 9.5 degrees of warmth, weighs 4.7 ounces, or 130 grams, and has a hood with a drawstring on it</strong> to keep your head nice and warm too. And who doesn't enjoy sleeping with silk against their skin after a long day on the trail.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-toaster-microfleece-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Toaster Microfleece</a> - Fleece is another popular sleeping bag liner material. It adds a good amount of warmth and feels nice against the skin. The Toaster <strong>weighs in at 20.8 ounces, or 560 grams, and has a drawstring hood</strong> for your head. There are <strong>no details available about how much additional warmth</strong> you can expect, but at 560 grams I would expect at least a few degrees.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/reactor-extreme-thermolite-liner\">Sea to Summit Reactor Extreme Thermolite</a> - Thermolite is an <strong>ideal material for turning a summer sleeping bag in to a winter sleeping bag</strong>. This particular model from Sea to Summit <strong>adds about 25 degrees of warmth to your sleeping bag</strong>, which is a very significant amount. What's even more impressive is that you get that <strong>25 degrees for just 14 ounces, or 399 grams, and that includes a drawcord hood</strong>. If you are buying a sleeping bag liner primarily for warmth, thermolite is the way to go.</li>

You may not end up needing the flashlight, but if you do need it you had better have one handy. But not just any flashlight can be used as a <strong>camping flashlight</strong>.
<h2>Camping Flashlight</h2>
Features to look for when reviewing camping flashlights.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Output -</strong> Different flashlights will give you varying amounts of light. This is usually measured in lumens. The more lumens a flashlight can give you, the brighter your flashlight will be. Many good flashlights will have variable output settings, so if you want bright you get bright, and if you just need to see a few outlines, you can get that too.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life -</strong> Battery life is another important factor when shopping for a camping flashlight. A flashlight <!--more-->that can give you 100 hours is better than a battery that can only do 50. But just know that generally, the longer battery life will mean less lumens.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Flashlight</h2>
A few of the very best camping flashlights.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/632461/photon-micro-light-ii-led-light\">Photon Micro Light II LED</a> - If you just need a light to root through your bag and not trip over any roots on your way to the bathroom at night, the Photon Micro is ideal. <strong>It's tiny, .17 ounces or 4.8 grams tiny</strong>, and only has a <strong>beam distance of 1.5 meters</strong>. But it also has a 120 hour battery life, and is a great camping flashlight if you're not planning on illuminating the whole forest.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus</a> - Camping flashlights are great, but camping headlamps are often better. Generally when you are using a flashlight you are illuminating something, something that you often need two hands to work with. <strong>For such situations, there are headlamps</strong>. This particular headlamp <strong>weighs just 2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong>, and gives you <strong>150 hours of light</strong> on the lowest of three brightness settings.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/pico-lite-flashlight\">eGear PICO Lite</a> - If nothing but a real flashlight will do, the PICO Lite is a great choice. It <strong>weighs just .2 ounces, or 5.7 grams</strong>, and gives off <strong>10 lumens of light</strong>. It also has a handy <strong>carabineer clip</strong> so that you can clip it to something when you're not using it. There's nothing worse than losing a flashlight in the dark, because you wont have a flashlight to find it.</li>

Hiking is thirsty work, after all, and if you end up delayed in the outdoors, water is one of the few things that are essential. There are many <strong>hiking water bottles</strong> out there, but only a few that will really get the job done well.
<h2>Hiking Water Bottles</h2>
A few features to look for on hiking water bottles.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> If you're just out for a quick hike then weight probably wont matter to you all that much, but for longer hikes, or multi-day hikes, a lightweight water bottle is a good idea, for the simple reason that carrying a heavy backpack is foolish when there are lighter water bottles available.</li>
	<li><strong>Chemical Free -</strong> Chemicals like BPA are very bad for you and were, up until a few years ago, widespread in many plastic bottles, including hiking water bottles. Most plastic bottles are now BPA free, but if you're worried about it, stainless steel hiking water bottles are a good alternative.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Water Bottles</h2>
Only the very best hiking water bottles for your next outdoor trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/402049/nalgene-wide-mouth-loop-top-round-bottle-32-fl-oz\">Nalgene Wide-Mouth Loop-Top</a> - You would be hard pressed to find someone that does not know the very popular Nalgene water bottle. It's <strong>extremely popular</strong>, and there is<!--more--> a good reason. It's <strong>tough, relatively light at 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams, and holds a full 32 ounces, or .95 liters of water</strong>. The wide mouth makes it very easy to fill, and it's now BPA free.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-platy-plus-bottle-cas0448\">Platypus Platy Plus</a> - The Platy Plus is something a little different. It is made out of tough, yet pliable plastic that <strong>you can fold up when not in use</strong>. If you're just hiking you might be indifferent, but for backpackers with limited space in their backpacks, it's a great feature to be able to roll up your unused water bottles and tuck them away. The <strong>2 liter version also only weighs 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>, so a great choice for the lightweight hiker.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/stainless-steel-bottle-12-40-oz\">Klean Kanteen Stainless Steel</a> - If you don't like plastic, there is always <strong>stainless steel</strong>. It's an extremely strong material that you wont ever have to worry about damaging. That extra strength costs you in the weight department, however, as the <strong>27 ounce version weighs 8 ounces, or 226 grams</strong>, which is considerably more than the other two options. So if you want strength this is a great choice, but lightweight it is not.</li>

	<li><strong>Timeframe -</strong> Some water purifiers work faster than others. If you can plan ahead then waiting for your water to become purified isn't so much of a problem, but when you need your water right away, waiting is never much fun.</li>
	<li><strong>Light -</strong> There are several different options for purifying your water, and some are lighter than others. If you have to carry your camping gear, if you're not just car camping, then <!--more-->the lighter option is likely going to be the more attractive option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Purifier - Camping</h2>
The very best in camping water purifiers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - The Adventurer Opti is the perfect example of technology being integrated in to backpacking and camping equipment. It uses <strong>UV light</strong> to instantly kill all of the bad stuff in the water. A quick blast of UV light and your water is ready for drinking. It also <strong>only weighs 3.6 ounces, or 103 grams</strong>, so it's a <strong>lightweight solution</strong> to drinkable water as well. The only thing to remember is that you will need batteries, and they will need to be <strong>replaced every 50 liters</strong> or so.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/671111/msr-sweetwater-water-purifier-system\">MSR SweetWater</a> - The SweetWater is a <strong>combination filter and purifier</strong>, so you get the best of both worlds, and can be absolutely sure that your water is safe for drinking. A .2 micron filter gets rid of most organisms, and the chlorine purification process takes care of the rest. It <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, or 320 grams</strong>, but if you need to be sure with questionable, the SweetWater is a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">Katadyn Micropur Tablets</a> - The Micropur tablets are <strong>chlorine dioxide tablets</strong> ideal for killing a wide range of organisms found in water. The main advantage of using tablets is that, first, there is no hard work involved. You just pop the tablet in to your water bottle and you're done. Second, they weigh next to nothing. <strong>A 30 tablet pack, good for 30 quarts, or 28 liters, weighs just .9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>. The downside to tablets, however, is that they take time to work their magic. More specifically, you have to <strong>wait 15 minutes for the tablets to kill viruses and bacteria, 30 minutes for Giardia and 4 hours for Cryptosporidium</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crude Water Filter</h2>
If you have a purifier, you may sometimes notice that your drinking water is a little cloudy. This cloudy material is all the material that would normally be filtered out by a physical filter. If your purifier has worked you shouldn't have anything to worry about from this material, but just in case, there are cheap and light <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-fitsall-filter\">prefilters</a> you can get to filter out that material.

And if you're in a pinch, or just don't want to bother with a prefilter, a reasonably clean bandana or T-Shirt does a good job of prefiltering too.

There are all kinds of things to see, including plants, geological formations and animals. Some may be a little farther away than you're willing to travel, however, and some, like the animals, you may not want to get too close to. Which is why it's sometimes handy to have <strong>hiking binoculars</strong> along with you.
<h2>Hiking Binoculars</h2>
A few features to look for to know you're getting a good pair of hiking binoculars.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Chances are, binoculars will spend a lot of time around your neck, which is exactly where you do not want something heavy to be hanging. It might not be too bad over a short amount of time, but on a longer hike, or a multi-day hike, heavy binoculars will wear on you.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> If you're in the outdoors, you will likely want your binoculars to be waterproof. It does<!--more--> sometimes rain in the outdoors, after all, and you should be prepared. Similarly, you want a pair of binoculars that is a little more rugged, that are not going to break at the first sign of dirt and dust.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Binoculars</h2>
Some of the best hiking binoculars that meet the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/744595/nikon-trailblazer-atb-waterproof-8-x-25-binoculars\">Nikon Trailblazer ATB Waterproof 8 x 25</a> - These binoculars are from a well known brand name in the world of optics, Nikon. They're <strong>compact and weigh just 9.9 ounces, or 280 grams</strong>, so ideal for hiking with, and give you <strong>8x zoom</strong> as you can see from the name. They're also <strong>waterproof</strong>, so you wont have to worry about the odd rain shower. All around a great pair of hiking binoculars.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/759468/rei-xr-8-x-25-waterproof-binoculars\">REI XR 8 x 25 Waterproof</a> - Another pair of compact bincoulars, this time from REI. They are very similar to the Nikon Trailblazers above, with the same <strong>zoom (8x) and also waterproof</strong>. The one real difference is that they <strong>weigh considerably more, at 14 ounces, or 396 grams, but the trade off is that they cost less</strong>, so if you're not concerned about weight you get the same basic binoculars for less money.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-echo-zoom-monocular-10-30x21\">Brunton Echo Zoom Monocular 10-30x21</a> - And if you are really concerned about weight you can always cut the binoculars down to half their normal size and take a <strong>monocular</strong> instead. The <strong>magnification is 10-30x</strong>, so you will be able to get a good look at whatever you are scoping out, and the <strong>weight is just 3.2 ounces, or 91 grams</strong>, which is extremely lightweight. The bad news is that the Echo Zoom is <strong>not waterproof</strong>, but then it is small enough to be stashed in a pocket when it's not needed, so you probably wont have to worry as much about the weather.</li>

Even if you're going for the lightest camping or backpacking setup possible, you will need something to eat off of. Fortunately, for those looking to save on weight, there are some excellent options for camping plates.
<h2>Camping Plates</h2>
What to look for when reviewing camping plates.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Weight not matter too much to you if all you do is car camping, but for those that have to carry their camping gear with them, weight is an important factor. Why carry a heavy camping plate, after all, when you could be carrying a lightweight camping plate instead.</li>
	<li><strong>High Sides -</strong> Camping meals are typically of the one pot variety. Pasta, for example, or soup. Whatever you make, you will probably be hungry enough to not want to lose one bit of <!--more-->that food. A plate with high sides, a sort of plate / bowl hybrid, if you will, is ideal for keeping you food on your plate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Plates</h2>
The very best in camping plate technology.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720285/snow-peak-titanium-plate\">Snow Peak Titanium Plate</a> - If you want a lightweight camping plate, <strong>titanium</strong> is your best choice. This particular plate from MSR <strong>weighs in at just 2 ounces, or 56 grams, and has a 7.5 inch diameter</strong>, which is plenty for most single serving meals. It also has high sides so you wont be losing any food to the ground.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-x-plate-collapsible-plate\">Sea to Summit X-Plate</a> - The X-Plate is about as technologically advanced as a camping plate can get. The <strong>sides of the plate are adjustable</strong>, so you can raise them up to make sure all your food stays on your plate, and lower them down so it's easier to store your plate in your backpack. All that advanced camping plate technology comes at a price, however, which is <strong>4.9 ounces, or 139 grams of weight</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/deepdish-plate\">MSR DeepDish Plate</a> - If you just want something <strong>cheap and basic that will hold your food</strong>, the DeepDish is ideal. I personally own the DeepDish and have nothing but good things to say about it. It has high sides, comes in a <strong>variety of sizes</strong> and is lightweight too, at <strong>2.6 ounces, or 75 grams for the medium, which is 7.6 inches across and 1.7 inches deep</strong>.</li>

Safety is important when you are hiking, and there are many things, from a rogue root in the trail, to wildlife, to weather, to malfunctioning gear that can cause injuries of all kinds. A hiking first aid kit, combined with the knowledge of how to use it, can prevent injuries from escalating in to serious problems.
<h2>Hiking First Aid Kit</h2>
The things to watch for when reviewing hiking first aid kits.
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Basics -</strong> There are a few basics, like bandaids, moleskins, antiobiotic wipes and sterile wraps that just about any hiking first aid kit should have, and will have. Beyond the basics, it is up<!--more--> to you to decide what you need and do not need. What you choose to bring will depend a lot on whether or not you know how to use it.</li>
	<li><strong>Knowledge -</strong> A hiking first aid kit is a tool, and if you do not know how to use the tool properly, then the tool isn't much help. Many hiking first aid kits come with a few basic instructions on using the different items contained within, but it is highly recommended that a little knowledge go along with a hiking first aid kit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking First Aid Kit</h2>
A few of the better hiking first aid kits.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708124/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-5-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight .5</a> - The Ultralight .5 is an ideal first aid kit to take care of all of the most basic medical concerns that might come up on a hike. It includes <strong>several different varieties of bandages, wipes to properly clean a wound, and a few medications like ibuprofen and aspirin</strong>. Also includes <strong>moleskin. It weighs 3.68 ounces, or 104 grams</strong>, and come in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695383/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-7-first-aid-kit\">.7</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/718294/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-9-first-aid-kit\">.9</a> size as well.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-watertight-3-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Kits Ultralight and and Watertight .3</a> - This is a <strong>lighter and smaller version of the Ultralight .5 above</strong>. It includes most of the same things as the kit above, just less of them. The bag is also much less durable than the bag of the .5, but if you want to save on weight, this version weighs <strong>just 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-weekender-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Weekender</a> - If you need a hiking first aid kit that is a little more comprehensive, the Medical Weekender is a good choice. It includes <strong>all of the basics, plus a few other items like CPR face shield, disposable thermometers, tweezers and a few instruction booklets that you might find yourself in need of. It weighs 1.6 pounds, or 737 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Possible Additions to a Hiking First Aid Kit</h2>
There are a few things you might want to add to a hiking first aid kit that you probably wont find in too many of them. A <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784611/adventure-medical-kits-suturesyringe-medic-kit\">suture / syringe kit</a>, for instance, may come in handy in a variety of situations. A razor blade can also come in handy in a variety of situations, and is a lightweight addition to any first aid kit.

One thing that a lot of people also add to their first aid kits is superglue. Superglue, also known as crazy glue, can be used to close wounds, and can be extremely handy for larger cuts and wounds. Finally, a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/800723/adventure-medical-kits-splinter-pickertick-remover-first-aid-kit-refill\">tick removal tool</a> can be handy to have, and can be used for splinters too."

When you have less bulk in your backpack, you can also afford to bring along a smaller backpack, which can further cut down on weight. For this reason, and others, it is a smart idea to choose a compact sleeping bag over something more bulky.
<h2>Compact Sleeping Bag</h2>
If you want a compact sleeping bag, these are the features to look out for.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> - You have two options when it comes to insulation for a sleeping bag, which are down and synthetic. Both have their positives and negatives, but one of the best positives associated with down is that it compacts a lot better than synthetic. More specifically, higher quality down, ideally in the 800 to 900 fill range, will compact down better than lesser quality down, such as 700 fill down.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Although the most lightweight sleeping bag wont always be the most compactable sleeping bag, it is at least a reliable indicator that the sleeping bag manufacturer is putting a little time and effort in to their product, and will help to save on weight, if not bulk.<!--more--></li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Compact Sleeping Bag</h2>
A few of the very best compact sleeping bags, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite Sleeping Bag</a> - If you want something that will perform well in warm weather, the HighLite is a fantastic choice. It's good <strong>down to 35 degrees</strong>, and uses very <strong>high quality 850+ fill down</strong>. It also weighs a very light <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>. The high quality down means that there will be less down in the sleeping bag, which means more air, which means more compression. It's not overly warm, but it is extremely compact.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +30</a> - With a slightly warmer <strong>temperature rating of 33 degrees</strong>, the Marmot +30 is an ideal progression from the HighLite above. It <strong>uses 900+ fill down</strong>, which is just about the best you will find from any sleeping bag manufacturer, and even <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award</strong>. It weighs a little more, at <strong>1.38 pounds, or 630 grams</strong>, but that extra weight includes a few extra features, like a draft collar, that some people will definitely appreciate, though that extra material does make the bag slightly less compactable.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down #1</a> - Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell is well known for making some excellent down products, including many down sleeping bags. This particular bag is <strong>rated down to 15 degrees</strong>, and weighs just <strong>2.25 pounds, or 1020 grams</strong>. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, but what really sets this bag apart from the competition is Mont Bell's unique design, which uses a biased cut to coil around you, adding warmth without adding bulk, and helping to make the sleeping bag more compact.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Alternative Packing Methods</h2>
If your goal is to cut down on bulk in your backpack, then there is a great alternative packing method that you might be interested in. By packing everything except the sleeping bag, and then stuffing the sleeping bag in to all the little cracks and crevices between other gear, you both cut down on bulk and also fill up all those little spaces and make your backpack a lot more stable, and less likely to be shifting around.

If you try this packing method, just be sure that there aren't any sharp corners that will tear the outer shell of your sleeping bag."

Walking up in the morning having rolled around and stared at the tent ceiling all night is no one's idea of fun. A good sleeping bag is important for getting a restful night of sleep, but equally important, and often overlooked, is a good sleeping pad. There are many excellent <strong>sleeping pads for camping</strong> out there, but finding one that will work for you will depend a lot on just what kind of sleeper you are.
<h2>Sleeping Pads for Camping</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing sleeping pads for camping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - You have two basic options when it comes to camping sleeping pads. Mummy sleeping pads are tapered towards the top and bottom, and use only the minimal amount of padding. These are good sleeping pads for those who don't move around as much at night. Rectangular sleeping pads are self explanatory, and are good for those who move around a little more at night.</li>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> - There are two kinds of padding when it comes to sleeping pads, which are inflatable and foam. Foam <!--more-->sleeping pads take up a bit more room, but also tend to weigh a bit less. Inflatable sleeping pads tend to be a bit more comfy, however.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> - R-Value is a measurement of how warm a sleeping pad is. The warmer your sleeping pad is, the more heat will be reflected back up when you're sleeping. So in winter, you want a sleeping pad with a high R-Value. You can read more about R-Values at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">Sleeping Pad R-Values</a> page.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Pads for Camping</h2>
A select few of the best sleeping pads for camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat Sleeping Pad</a> - If you are looking for a <strong>sleeping pad for winter</strong>, there are few better than the DownMat. It has an extremely high <strong>R-Value of 8</strong>, which comes from a layer of down built in to the top of the sleeping pad. It's also <strong>3.5 inches thick</strong> when inflated, so you get plenty of padding. It's <strong>rectangular shaped, but at 2.2 pounds, or 1020 grams</strong>, it's actually quite a bit lighter than comparable sleeping pads.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Sleeping Pad</a> - The NeoAir is likely the <strong>most popular sleeping pad</strong> out there at the moment. It <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and has only gotten better since then. It's also <strong>rectangular</strong>, and is <strong>2.5 inches thick and has an R-value of 2.5</strong>, but where it really stands out is weight, at just <strong>14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-3-4.html\">Nightlight Sleeping Pad</a> - Foam is definitely a different sleeping experience from inflatable, which most people find a little less comfortable. If, however, you don't mind a hard sleeping surface, then there are some definite advantages to foam sleeping pads like the Nightlight. For one, it weighs less, at just <strong>12 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>, and is <strong>rectangular, with a egg shell design</strong> for improved comfort to weight. It's also only <strong>3/4 length</strong>, so either your feet or your head will hang off, but all the important contact points will be padded with <strong>.75 inches of foam</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - If you're <strong>not looking to spend too much</strong>, then the Clearview series of camping sleeping pads is a great option. There is a <strong>rectangular and mummy option</strong>, and also a number of lengths. All are <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong>, and the average weight is about <strong>15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong>, which is a very respectable weight, especially for the price.</li>

Fortunately, there are many excellent <strong>hiking shoes for men</strong> and women out there that will allow your feet to make it through the day without any major incidents. And that really is the measure of a good hiking shoe, if your feet can make it through a day or a couple days of hiking without any injuries.
<h2>Hiking Shoes for Men</h2>
Feature to look for when reviewing hiking shoes for men.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - Depending on the season and the conditions where you do most of your hiking, you may or may not want to invest in a pair of waterproof hiking shoes. Waterproof is always nice to <!--more-->have, but generally, you have to sacrifice a bit of breathability to get it, so it's a bit of a trade off. Do you want your hiking shoes to be more waterproof, or more breathable?</li>
	<li><strong>Breathable</strong> - Similar to the point made above, breathable hiking shoes are ideal, especially for hot, sunny conditions, but getting breathable shoes generally means that you have to get hiking shoes that are not waterproof. So decide what combination of waterproof and breathable you want, and go from there.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Every pound of weight on your feet is roughly equivalent to 5 pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure, so the weight of your hiking shoes really does matter. Heavy hiking shoes will leave you exhausted at the end of the day, whereas lightweight hiking shoes will leave you with enough energy for a little more hiking.</li>

A few of the very best hiking shoes for men, based on the criteria above.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-x-talon-212-trail-running-shoe-mens\">Inov8 X-Talon 212</a> - Inov8 is a UK based company with a certain philosophy, which is to supply lightweight, durable shoes. The 212s are a perfect example of this. They <strong>weighs 7.5 ounces, or 212 grams</strong>, as the name suggests, which is extremely lightweight for a pair of hiking shoes. They have a <strong>sticky rubber sole</strong>, for excellent grip even in bad conditions, and a very <strong>breathable upper</strong> so that your feet can breath. They wont keep you dry, but they definitely will keep you energized and cool.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-men-s\">Montrail Mountain Masochist</a> - A hiking shoe similar to the 212s above, but from more well known manufacturer Montrail. The Mountain Masochists weigh <strong>10.8 ounces, or 306 grams</strong>, so slightly heavier than the 212s, and are also quite porous throughout the upper, so <strong>they will breath well</strong>, but will not protect your feet from getting wet, should it rain. But another great, lightweight choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818510/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-gtx-trail-running-shoes-mens\">Salomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 GTX</a> - If weight isn't your first concern, and you want something a little more durable and waterproof, then these are a great choice of hiking shoe from Salomon. They're <strong>waterproof</strong>, but use the Pro XCR version of Gore-Tex, which is <strong>relatively breathable</strong>, so your feet wont be suffocating. They also have plenty of traction, but at <strong>1.78 pounds, or 810 grams</strong>, they are significantly heavier than either of the two options above.</li>

For one, a liner is a lot easier to clean than an entire sleeping bag. Some people also prefer the feel of something like cotton, as opposed to the usual interior of a sleeping bag. A liner can also add a few degrees of warmth to a sleeping bag, giving it the boost in temperature rating that you need to get a good sleep. Whatever reason you have for wanting a sleeping bag liner, there are many excellent <strong>cotton sleeping bag liners</strong> on the market.
<h2>Cotton Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
Features to be on the lookout for when shopping for cotton sleeping bag liners.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - You will want to get a sleeping bag liner that is roughly the same shape as your sleeping bag. So if you have a rectangular shaped sleeping bag, you will want to get a rectangular shaped sleeping bag liner. For mummy shaped sleeping bags, you will want a mummy shaped sleeping bag liner.</li>
	<li><strong>Blend</strong> - Cotton is sometimes blended with other materials for sleeping bag liners, most commonly silk, for a<!--more--> few reasons. One is that this lowers the weight of the sleeping bag liner. Another is silk feels very nice to sleep against. It's another option to be aware of when reviewing sleeping bag liners.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cotton Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
A few of the better cotton sleeping bag liners that you can choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/627255/cocoon-cotton-bag-linertravel-sheet\">Cocoon Cotton Bag Liner</a> - First up, a fairly standard sleeping bag liner from Cocoon. It's <strong>rectangular</strong>, and has a pocket where you can put a pillow, so that you don't lose the pillow at night. You can expect about <strong>5 degrees of warmth</strong> to be added to the temperature of your sleeping bag, and it <strong>weighs 15 ounces, or 425 grams</strong>, which is definitely on the heavy side.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/silk-lite-liner\">Sea to Summit Premium Silk/Cotton Liner</a> - This sleeping bag liner from Sea to Summit is <strong>blend of silk and cotton</strong>. It comes in a <strong>few different shapes, including rectangular and mummy</strong>, though there is no word how much warmth you can expect to gain. Likely it's no more than a few degrees. The mummy shaped version <strong>weighs 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams</strong>, which is quite a bit lighter than the Cocoon liner above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/cocoon-egyptian-cotton-mummy-liner\">Cocoon Egyptian Cotton Mummy Liner</a> - Another cotton sleeping bag liner from Cocoon. The main difference, as you can probably tell, is that this liner is made from <strong>Egyptian cotton</strong>. Another big difference is that this is a<strong> mummy shaped liner</strong>, as opposed to rectangular. It also weighs quite a bit less, at <strong>7.4 ounces, or 209 grams</strong>, and even adds a bit more <strong>warmth, at 7 degrees</strong>.</li>

There are plenty of other animals that produce down that would be suitable for jackets, and ducks are one of them. <strong>Duck down jackets</strong> aren’t nearly as popular as goose down jackets, but they definitely do exist. And while there isn’t a whole lot of difference between duck down and goose down, if you prefer duck down jackets, you definitely have a few choices available to you.
<h2>Duck Down Jackets</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for duck down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Just like with goose down jackets, the quality of the down in a duck down jacket will vary. Duck down with a higher fill number provides better loft, and thus gives you more warmth, without adding any more weight. So generally, higher quality down is better.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Duck down, just like goose down, doesn’t do a very good job of keeping you warm when <!--more-->it gets wet. If you let it get wet you’ll get cold, and then you’ll be wet and cold, which is never a good combination. So it’s a good idea to get a water resistant, or even waterproof duck down jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Duck Down Jackets</h2>
There aren't many of them, but here are some of the best duck down jackets for men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Duck Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you need to stay warm there's no better choice than a Canada Goose jacket. Despite the company name they actually use duck down in their jackets. This particular one uses <strong>625+ fill duck down</strong>, and has a <strong>water resistant exterior</strong>. It also has a number of features to help you stay warm, like a <strong>fur lined hood, fleece lined pockets and even a snow skirt</strong>. A fantastic choice of jacket when you really need to stay warm.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805909/white-sierra-devils-dance-down-jacket-mens-special-buy\">White Sierra Devils Dance Down Jacket</a> - The Devils Dance is built with a more active, outdoorsy use in mind. It uses <strong>550+ fill down</strong>, but no water resistant exterior, so you will want to be careful to keep this jacket dry. But it has <strong>two zippered pockets, plus a zippered chest pocket</strong>, and a an athletic cut, making it a good choice for hikers, backpackers and anyone else who likes to get out and be active.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Duck Down Jackets</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-expedition-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Expedition Down Parka</a> - If you want warm, you want a Canada Goose jacket. Despite the company name the jacket is actually filled with <strong>625+ fill duck down</strong>, not goose down. The <strong>exterior of the jacket is water resistant</strong>, to help keep the down dry, but what this jacket is about is keeping you warm, and that's where it stands out. Features like a snow skirt, <strong>fleece lined pockets and a fur lined hood</strong> are all designed to keep you as warm as possible.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805937/white-sierra-paradise-falls-down-jacket-womens-special-buy\">White Sierra Paradise Falls Down Jacket</a> - The Paradise Falls is a jacket intended more for those who like to stay active in the outdoors. It has a more <strong>athletic, low profile cut. It uses 550+ fill down</strong>, but where it comes up short is with a lack of a water resistant exterior. So you will need to be careful to have a rain shell available, because you don't want to let this jacket get wet. Still, it's one of the few duck down jackets out there, and a good choice for anyone who keeps active outside.</li>

When you do your dishes, you need soap to help get the job done. And if you're spending any significant amount of time in the outdoors then you yourself will need to be cleaned, in which case soap is required. Rather than taking all kinds of different soaps and shampoos and whatever else, it's always going to be easier to just take one small container of backpacking soap.
<h2>Backpacking Soap</h2>
The features to look for from backpacking soap.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Multi-Purpose -</strong> Backpacking soap should absolutely be multi-purpose. The two main uses that people will have for backpacking soap in the wilderness will be cleaning their cookware and eating utensils, and cleaning themselves. You could take two different soaps for each task, but there's no reason you cant take one soap that will do both.</li>
	<li><strong>Concentrated -</strong> Backpacking soap should be concentrated as much as possible. If you have to use more than <!--more-->a few drops for whatever you are using it for, then it's not concentrated enough. That way, you only have to take a small amount of soap with you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Soap</h2>
A few of the very best backpacking soaps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-wilderness-wash\">Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash</a> - Wilderness Wash is a highly concentrated backpacking soap made by Australian manufacturer Sea to Summit. It's <strong>biodegradable</strong>, so it is environment friendly, and also <strong>phosphate and fragrance free</strong>, so you wont have any curious bears or other wildlife trying to get a sniff of you in the middle of the night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camping-soap\">Campsuds Camping Soap</a> - Another <strong>very concentrated backpacking soap</strong> from Campsuds. It's also <strong>biodegradable</strong>, so you wont be leaving anything harmful behind in the environment. It also comes in <strong>four different sizes</strong>, so no matter how much or how little you need, there is a size appropriate for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/730925/dr-bronners-organic-liquid-soap-travel-size\">Dr. Bronners Organic Liquid Soap</a> - Dr. Bronners is something a bit different, as far as backpacking soaps go. It it <strong>extremely concentrated</strong>, just like the other two backpacking soaps listed, but where it really stands out is in the multi-use category. It <strong>works well as a dish soap, a body soap and also as toothpaste</strong>. It's a bit of a soapy toothpaste, but still, it does work well in that role. If you plan to use it as a toothpaste, I can personally recommend the eucalyptus flavor, though I'm sure almond and peppermint would be good too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backpacking Soap Accessories</h2>
With the super concentrated soaps above, there is little sense in taking along more than you need. For most jobs you will only need a few drops, and so for even a week long trip, you will only need a very small amount of soap. Many of the above soaps already come in very small bottles, but if you want to really save on space, I recommend picking up a small <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/634320/nalgene-drop-dispenser-bottle-2-fl-oz\">dropper bottle</a>, which you can then fill with as much soap as you need. A dropper bottle also frees you up to buy a large container of soap, rather than having to constantly buy new travel size soaps.

Wet feet are never much fun, after all, and over a long enough time period, can lead to all kinds of foot problems that will leave your feet in a bad state. Wet feet when it's cold out can lead to a whole new host of problems, and the last thing you want in cold conditions is wet feet.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Boots</h2>
What to look for when reviewing waterproof hiking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing -</strong> You have two main choices when it comes to waterproof boots, and that is Gore-Tex or leather. Gore-Tex waterproof hiking boots tend to be lighter, and more breathable, whereas leather tends to be heavier, but more durable and more waterproof over an entire day of hiking in wet conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Every pound on your feet is equal to about 5 pounds on your back, in terms of the energy you spend. And hiking boots can get heavy quickly. So you<!--more--> should, above all else, try to find waterproof hiking boots that don't feel like you're walking around with weights on your feet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Boots</h2>
Waterproof hiking boots, broken down by gender.
<h3><strong>Waterproof Hiking Boots for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/asolo-tps-520-gv-backpacking-boot-mens\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Boot</a> - The TPS 520 is a perfect example of a <strong>full grained leather hiking boot</strong>. But just to keep you extra dry, it also comes with a <strong>Gore-Tex liner</strong>. A vibram sole helps round things out. Full grain leather and a Gore-Tex liner isn't lightweight, however, as these weigh a full <strong>3 pounds 10 ounces, or 1644 grams</strong>, but if you absolutely must stay dry, these are the hiking boots for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/kailash-gtx-boot-men-s\">Scarpa Kailish GTX Boot</a> - <strong>Winner of the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, the Kailish hiking boots are a great example of <strong>waterproof and lightweight</strong>. First, you get a <strong>Gore-Tex liner</strong>, so you can count on staying dry even in wet conditions. But the pair of boots weighs just <strong>22 ounces, or 630 grams</strong>, which is significantly less than the Asolo hiking boots above. You don't get the extra protection and durability of leather, but you will be a lot less tired at the end of your hike.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Waterproof Hiking Boots for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693986/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-womens\">Asolo TPS 520 Hiking Boots</a> - These are the same boots as the men's TPS 520s above, just with a women's sizing and cut. They are a combination of <strong>full grain leather and a Gore-Tex liner</strong>, which introduces a bit of redundancy in to the waterproofing, and ensures that you will stay dry in even the worst conditions. The main drawback to this redundancy, however, is weight, which is a steep <strong>3 pounds 5 ounces, or 1500 grams for the pair</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/scarpa-kailash-gtx-boot-womens\">Scarpa Kailish GTX Boot</a> - This is the same hiking boot as the Scarpa in the men's section above. Like the men's boot, it <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a high quality boot. It uses a <strong>Gore-Tex liner</strong> to keep your feet dry, but what really stands out about the Kailish is the weight, which is just <strong>19 ounces, or 538 grams for the pair</strong>. At just a fraction of the weight of the Asolos, you will feel a lot less tired at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Waterproof Hiking Boots</h2>
If you want to waterproof a pair of hiking boots that are not waterproof themselves, or if you want to supplement the waterproofing on a pair of boots you already have, waterproof socks are an option. <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/688268/rocky-gore-tex-oversocks-socks\">Rocky Gore-Tex Oversocks</a>, for instance, provide you with a Gore-Tex liner in your boots, which will keep your feet dry, even if your boots get wet."

Lightweight is great, after all, but if you're not getting any sleep you're not going to be having very much fun. Those looking to save on weight will be happy to know that there are some very lightweight backpacking pillows out there, that you will hardly even notice in your backpack.
<h2>Backpacking Pillow</h2>
Things to look for from a backpacking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Compact -</strong> A pillow is a fairly bulky item, and bulky items, especially bulky luxury items, are never a fun thing to have to find room for in a backpack. For that reason, try to get a backpacking pillow that will pack down small when not in use, and not take up too much room.</li>
	<li><strong>Comfortable -</strong> An uncomfortable backpacking pillow is about as useful as no backpacking pillow at all. If you're going to bring a backpacking pillow with you, make<!--more--> sure that it is at least comfortable enough to get you through the night without waking you up.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Pillow</h2>
The very best in backpacking pillow technology.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719845/therm-a-rest-trekker-pillowcase\">Therm-A-Rest Trekker Pillowcase</a> - Why take the whole pillow when you can just take a <strong>pillowcase</strong> instead? Most people will have something to stuff in to a pillow case, like a fleece sweater or a down jacket, which will give you more than enough cushion for your head. You can always grab a pillowcase from home, but this pillowcase from Therm-A-Rest is <strong>soft polyester microfiber</strong> that will help cushion whatever you find to stuff inside your pillow case. It <strong>weighs 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong> and compresses down a lot better than any pillow ever will.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort Pillow System</a> - Another innovative pillow, this is actually a <strong>blow up pillow</strong>. What's great about an inflatable pillow is that you can vary the height and stiffness of the pillow according to your preferences, and it <strong>packs down extremely small</strong> when not in use. It <strong>weighs 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - If you don't want anything inventive and just want a regular old pillow for your head, you wont do better than this <strong>extremely compressible backpacking pillow</strong> from Therm-A-Rest. It comes in <strong>three sizes</strong>, depending on how much pillow you want, and the <strong>medium version weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to a Backpacking Pillow</h2>
As alluded to in the the review of the Therm-A-Rest Pillowcase, there is an easy alternative to a pillow, and that is a few pieces of particularly soft clothing piled on top of each other. It's not a pillow, but in a pinch it will allow you to get a full night of sleep, and it weighs nothing."

The main draw of a water purifier over a filter is that there is typically less bulk to deal with, though purifiers do have a few disadvantages as well.
<h2>Backpacking Water Purifier</h2>
Features to look out for when shopping for backpacking water purifiers.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> The main advantage that water purifiers have over water filters is that they tend to weigh less. So the last thing you would want to do is get a heavy backpacking water purifier that negates that advantage. Plus, with a lightweight water purifier your back and legs will thank you after a long day of backpacking.</li>
	<li><strong>Time to Purify -</strong> The main disadvantage of water purifiers is that depending on what kind you use, you might end up waiting for quite a while for the water purifier to work <!--more-->its magic. If you plan ahead it's not such a hassle, but it can sometimes end up being a hassle, having to wait for water that you want to drink to become purified.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Water Purifier</h2>
The best of the best for your next camping or backpacking trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">Katadyn Micropur Purification Tablets</a> - The water purification option that many backpackers end up using is tablets or droplets. The Micropur tablets are a good example of this sort of system. <strong>1 tablet is good for purifying 1 liter</strong> of water, and a package of <strong>30 tablets weighs just .9 ounces, or 25 grams</strong>. The bad news is that the tablets take <strong>15 minutes to get rid of bacteria, 30 minutes for Giardia and a full four hours for Cryptosporidium</strong>. So be sure to plan ahead.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">Hydro Photon SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - The Adventurer actually uses <strong>UV light</strong> to get rid of the bad stuff lurking in your water. The good thing about this water purification method is that it is very quick, at <strong>8 minutes per gallon</strong>. The bad news is that you have to replace the batteries every 50 liters. The unit <strong>weighs 3.6 ounces, or 102 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/671111/msr-sweetwater-water-purifier-system\">MSR SweetWater Water Purifier System</a> - The SweetWater is something a little different. It is actually a combination filter and purifier. It uses a <strong>.2 micron filter</strong> to remove anything large and unpleasant from your water, and a <strong>chlorine based purification system</strong> to nullify anything that makes it through. It's an ideal unit when you're drinking from questionable water sources. All told, it <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, or 320 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>When a Purifier Isn't Enough</h2>
If you only have a water purifier and are expecting to have to drink from some water sources that are less than clear, you might want to do some prefiltering. A stand alone <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-fitsall-filter\">prefilter</a> is one option. A reasonably clean shirt or bandana is another option that many backpackers use to good effect. And then when you've filtered the water, you can go ahead and hit it with your backpacking water purifier."

It helps to know when the sun is going down, for instance, or when the tides are changing, or what the weather is doing, or any number of other important things. The <strong>best hiking watch</strong> will tell you all that and a lot more. There really isn't too much technology that is essential in the outdoors, but a good camping watch is a definite exception.
<h2>Best Hiking Watch</h2>
Features to be on the lookout for when you are reviewing hiking watches.
<ul>
	<li><strong>____meter -</strong> You can still find some excellent hiking watches that are just watches, but many higher end hiking watches now come with all kinds of extras, like altimeters, thermometers, barometers and more to help you stay informed about the world around you when you are in the outdoors.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> It almost goes without saying, but a good hiking watch is a waterproof watch. It's<!--more--> a wet world out there, and it's not very practical to have to put your watch away every time it starts raining. Fortunately, most hiking watches are waterproof, so it's not something you have to worry about too much.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hiking Watch Reviews</h2>
Reviews of the very best in hiking watch technology currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/timex/expedition-camper-watch-full-size\">Timex Expedition Camper Watch</a> - If you aren't interested in spending a lot of money, and just want something that is going to tell you what time it is, the Camper from Timex is the perfect hiking watch for you. It's <strong>rugged, and water resistant to 100 meters</strong>, so you don't have to worry about hurting it. It has a <strong>indigo backlight</strong> for when it gets dark out, and an easy to use velcro band to get the perfect size, but that's really about it. <strong>Simple and straightforward</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778410/casio-pathfinder-paw1500-1v-multifunction-watch\">Casio Pathfinder PAW1500-1V Multifunction Watch</a> - The PAW1500 is the complete other side of the spectrum from the Timex watch above. It includes a <strong>barometer</strong> to give you advance warning of weather changes, an <strong>altimeter</strong> to let you know your elevation, and a <strong>thermometer</strong> for the temperature. It even has a <strong>digital compass</strong> built in, just in case you get lost, and tide and moon data too. One of the most interesting features, however, is that it's actually <strong>solar powered</strong>, so there's no need to worry about replacing the batteries. A hiking watch for those that like their gadgets.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/suunto-vector-altimeter-watch\">Suunto Vector Altimeter Watch</a> - The Vector is more the middle of the road, when it comes to hiking watches. It has the same extras as the Pathfinder, including the <strong>barometer, thermometer and altimeter as well as the digital compass</strong>, but runs off of a good old fashioned battery. It also costs about $100 less than the Pathfinder, so a good choice for somebody who wants something <strong>feature rich but without an especially high price tag</strong>.</li>

Percolators tend to be large and heavy, and not well suited for camping. If you're car camping they're an option, but if you are carrying your gear you might be better suited with a french press or other kind of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/1641/camping-coffee-maker/\">coffee maker</a>. But if nothing but percolated coffee will do, there are a few <strong>camping coffee percolator</strong> options available to you.
<h2>Camping Coffee Percolator</h2>
Features to be on the look out for when reviewing camping coffee percolators.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> If you have to carry your gear then you should at least try to make it lightweight gear. This is doubly true for luxury camping equipment like coffee percolators. Unfortunately, there aren't too many camping coffee percolators to choose from, and most of them are not all that light.</li>
	<li><strong>Cups Made -</strong> People rarely go camping by themselves, and the decent thing to do is to make a cup of coffee for your companion or companions too. Try to find a camping <!--more-->coffee percolator that goes well with the kind of group sizes that you normally go camping with.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Percolator</h2>
There aren't many camping coffee percolators out there on the market, but these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/401139/open-country-2-5-cup-coffee-perk\">Open Country 2 - 5 Cup Coffee Perk</a> - The Open Country coffee percolator is ideal if you want something a little <strong>smaller and lighter. It's aluminum</strong>, and makes coffee for anywhere from <strong>2 to 5 cups</strong>, which is an ideal size for most camping groups. More specifically, it holds 40 liquid ounces, or 1.18 liters. It has a convenient handle that folds down, and weighs a total of <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/765758/rei-campware-percolator-12-cup\">REI Cookware Percolator</a> - This is a percolator that occupies the other end of the spectrum, in terms of size. It will <strong>make 12 cups</strong>, or more accurately, holds 60 fluid ounces, which is 1.77 liters. It's <strong>stainless steel</strong>, which will keep it from being dented, but also makes it quite heavy, at <strong>2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/glacier-stainless-steel-percolator\">GSI Stainless Steel Percolator</a> - Another camping coffee percolator, this time from GSI. This particular model comes in a wide variety of sizes, <strong>ranging from 3 cups to 14 cups</strong>, so you can get the size that is right for your group. It's made from <strong>stainless steel</strong>, so strong, but also heavy, with the <strong>9 cup version weighing 1 pound 9 ounces, or 708 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Alternatives to Percolators</h2>
If you don't have to have percolated coffee, there are many other coffee filter options that are better suited to camping. A <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">french press</a>, for example, will double well as a cooking pot, making it a versatile option. And a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">simple filter</a> will work equally well as an immersion coffee filter or a tea filter, and weighs next to nothing."

They will hold your soup just as easily as they hold your pasta. They also come in quite a few different materials and designs, such that you can be sure there is a camping bowl out there for you. Of course as with any camping gear, there are a few things that you should keep in mind when you are reviewing camping bowls for your next outdoor trip.
<h2>Camping Bowls</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for a new camping bowl.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> Unless you are car camping you have to carry your camping gear, so you might as well get a lightweight camping bowl, instead <!--more-->of a heavy camping bowl. Your wallet might not even notice, but your legs and back definitely will after a full day of walking on the trail.</li>
	<li><strong>Versatile -</strong> It's best to get a camping bowl that is versatile enough to eat just about anything out of. If you have to take along a camping bowl as well as a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/1663/camping-plates/\">camping plate</a>, you are missing out on an opportunity to save some weight and bulk by taking one piece of equipment that can fill both roles.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Bowls</h2>
There are many camping bowls out there, but these are a few of the very best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752844/guyot-designs-squishy-bowl-and-cup-set\">Guyot Designs Squishy Bowl and Cup Set</a> - This rather innovative camping bowl <strong>won the 2007 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. The main feature, as per its name, is that it is squishy. This comes in extremely handy when it comes time pack your backpack. You don't have to worry about finding a place for it, you just throw it in and it squishes down. It comes in a set with a cup, but the <strong>bowl by itself weighs 3.3 ounces, or 93 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-deep-dish-plate\">MSR Deep Dish Plate</a> - Is it a plate, is it a bowl? Really, it's a bit of both. The Deep Dish has a wide, <strong>flat bottom like a plate, but 1.7 inch high sides, like a bowl</strong>. So you can eat your pasta in it just as easily as you could eat soup. It comes in three different sizes, and the medium <strong>weighs 2.6 ounces, or 75 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-bowl\">Snow Peak Titanium Bowl</a> - When it comes to camping kitchen equipment,<strong> titanium</strong> is the best material. It's strong, lightweight and doesn't leach anything in to your food. This bowl from Snow Peak weighs a very <strong>slim 2 ounces, or 56 grams</strong>, which makes it the lightest bowl on this list.</li>

You hope that you wont have to use it, but if you do need it, it's there, and can mean the difference between a little discomfort and a serious problem. There are a great many things that you could put in to a backpacking first aid kit, but there are also a few essentials that just about every kit should not be without.
<h2>Backpacking First Aid Kit</h2>
What to look for when shopping for backpacking first aid kits.
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Essentials -</strong> Your backpacking first aid kit should, at a minimum, have a few essentials that you will tend to need on a semi regular basis. Things like bandages, mole skin and alcohol wipes are all the kinds of things that will most commonly be needed from a first aid kit.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> Though not essential, it helps if your backpacking first aid kit is waterproof. Some things in a first aid kit, such as bandages, will be<!--more--> susceptible to water damage, and you the last thing you want to reach in to your first aid kit and find that half of the contents have been ruined by water.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking First Aid Kit</h2>
The best backpacking first aid kits to keep you safe in the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/708124/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-5-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Kits .5 First-Aid Kit</a> - Adventure medical kits has a whole line of kits ideal for backpackers, in varying sizes, which are delineated by the .5 in this case, though there is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695383/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-7-first-aid-kit\">.7</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/718294/adventure-medical-kits-ultralight-watertight-9-first-aid-kit\">.9</a>. The .5 has all the essentials, like <strong>bandages, mole skin and wound cleaning supplies, as well as a few things, like ibuprofen and aspirin</strong>, that backpackers might commonly need. The larger sizes mainly just have more of the same things that the .5 has, though there are a few additions in the larger sizes, like Diamode, that backpackers might find useful. The <strong>.5 weighs 3.68 ounces, or 104 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-weekender-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical Weekender First Aid Kit</a> - The Weekender is a bigger first aid kit, <strong>made for more people and more time in the outdoors</strong>. If you are in charge of first aid for a group of people, you want something more like this. It has all the <strong>essentials, as well as a few other additions, like disposable thermometers, tweezers for ticks and slivers, and instruction booklets</strong> if you're not quite up on your first aid knowledge. It's intended <strong>for 1 to 6 people over a period of 1 to 7 days, and it weighs 1.6 pounds, or 737 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralight-watertight-3-first-aid-kit\">Adventure Medical .3 First Aid Kit Dryflex</a> - The <strong>.3 is a smaller and lighter version of the .5 above</strong>. It has just the absolute basics, and not too much of them. It also comes in a <strong>resealable plastic bag</strong>, as opposed to the more durable bag of the .5 model and above.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Additions to Backpacking First Aid Kits</h2>
There are a few items that are smart additions to the average backpacking first aid kit. A razor blade, for instance, is useful in a number of situations, from cutting bandages to cutting flesh. An <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/adventure-medical/sol-emergency-blanket-one-person\">emergency blanket</a> is another smart addition, as is super glue, which can be used instead of stitches to close up any large wounds until you can get the wound properly treated. If you don't like the idea of super glueing your wounds shut, a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/784611/adventure-medical-kits-suturesyringe-medic-kit\">suture / syringe kit</a> fulfills much the same purpose.

Finally, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/800723/adventure-medical-kits-splinter-pickertick-remover-first-aid-kit-refill\">tick removal tweezers</a> are a good thing to have."

Outside of a few parks you don't actually need a bear canister, and there are alternatives to bear canisters, which you can find below, but a bear canister does provide a certain peace of mind that your food will still be there in the morning. There are some big differences between bear canisters, however, and a <strong>bear canister comparison</strong> is a useful thing to look at before buying.
<h2>Before you Buy a Bear Canister...</h2>
Figure out where you are going to be using your bear canister. A lot of people end up buying bear canisters because they are required in many national parks where bears are numerous. Before you buy, be sure that your bear canister is approved for use in those parks. This will save you from having to buy a second, approved bear canister later. You can find the approved bear canisters for <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/bear-canisters.htm\">Olympic Park</a> here, and for the <a href=\"http://sierrawild.gov/bears/allowed-bear-canisters\">Sierra region</a> here. Keep in mind that canisters <!--more-->may be added or removed from the lists, depending on the reports that the Parks Service gets.
<h2>Bear Canister Comparison</h2>
There aren't too many bear canisters on the market, and these are the best of them.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/624081/garcia-bear-resistant-container\">Garcia Bear-Resistant Container</a> - This bear canister from Garcia is a good all around bear canister. It <strong>holds 10 liters, which is 614 cu in, or put another way, about enough food for one person for 6 to 7 days. It weighs 2.75 pounds, or 1.24 kilograms</strong>. It doesn't have the biggest opening, so you might have a little trouble getting larger food items in. It's also black, which is a problem because bears often drag bear canisters away in to the bush, and finding a black canister wont be the easiest thing in the world to do. It is <strong>approved by the Parks Service as of this writing</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\">Bear Vault BV500</a> - The  BV500 is an excellent bear canister. It's relatively <strong>lightweight, at 2.55 pounds, or 1.16 kilograms, and holds quite a bit too, at 11.5 liters, or 700 cu in, which enough room for about a weeks worth of food</strong>. It also has a big, wide opening and<strong> is clear</strong>, which wont help you find it after a bear drags it away, but will help you find that Snickers bar at the bottom of the bear vault. It<strong> won the 2004 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and is <strong>approved by the Parks Service as of this writing</strong>. It also comes in a smaller size, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\">BV450</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-keg\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - The bear keg is heavier than the other two, at <strong>4.2 pounds, or 1.92 kilograms</strong>, and does not hold significantly more, at <strong>11.7 liters, or 716 cu in</strong>. The one thing that it definitely does have going for it is that it is <strong>bright yellow, so if a bear ever drags your Bear Keg away in to the bush, you should have no difficultly finding it again</strong>. But the significantly extra weight is definitely a big drawback.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bear Canister Alternatives</h2>
If you're just camping in bear country, and not in a park where a bear canister is required, then there are some lightweight alternatives to a bear canister, such as hanging your food. The <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8FXRJldcpE\">PCT method</a> is one popular hanging method, named after the Pacific Crest Trail, which travels along the Rockies from Mexico to Canada, and through plenty of bear country. All you need is a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/766592/sea-to-summit-evac-dry-sack\">stuff sack</a> for you food, a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/nitron-carabiner\">carabiner</a> for the stuff sack, and some <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/blue-water-pre-cut-accessory-cord-3mm-x-50ft\">lightweight cord</a> to get everything hanging from a tree."

Bear attacks are quite rare, and deaths from bear attacks even more so, but they do happen, and having a canister of bear pepper spray on hand can help prevent you from being a victim, should you be unlucky enough to find yourself in that situation.
<h2>Human and Bear Pepper Spray</h2>
The contents of bear pepper spray and pepper sprays intended for use on people are largely the same. The big difference between the two is that bear pepper spray is designed to spray significantly farther and for longer than pepper spray intended for humans. By spraying farther you are able to douse the bear with pepper spray before it is right on top <!--more-->of you, avoiding a physical confrontation.
<h2>Best Bear Pepper Spray</h2>
There isn't too much choice when it comes to bear pepper sprays, but there are a few different options available.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Spray (290 g)</a> - This lager bear spray will spray for a total of 9.2 seconds, and will reach a distance of 12 feet to 32 feet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">Counter Assault Bear Spray (230 g)</a> - This smaller bear spray will spray for a total of 7 seconds, and will reach a distance of 12 feet to 30 feet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accessories For Your Bear Pepper Spray</h2>
Bear spray is a useful thing to have, but not if you cant get it out quickly.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Counter Assault Holster</a> - This holster will work with either of the Counter Assault bear sprays listed above. It attaches easily to your belt, and secures the bear spray with a velcro strap, which makes it easy to access the bear spray quickly, should you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/kozee-tote-bear-pepper-spray-container\">Carrying Container</a> - Remember that bear spray is nasty stuff, and the last thing you want is your bear spray getting accidentally discharged in an enclosed space, like a plane, helicopter or vehicle, where the pilot or driver could be incapacitated. For such situations, a carrying case is essential.</li>

An <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-emergency-bivvy\">emergency blanket</a> would fit well here.</li>
	<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/632461/photon-micro-light-ii-led-light\">Light Source</a></strong> - It doesn't have to be big, but a light source can be an important thing to have in a survival situation.</li>

For backpackers, campers and hikers especially, down provides a warmth to weight ratio that makes it a very attractive option. It's the kind of garment that you can stuff in to your bag and forget about until you need it. The one big caveat with down, however, is that you should try as much as possible to not get it wet. But that said, you will not have much trouble finding a great <strong>women's down jacket</strong>.
<h2>Women's Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you are reviewing women's down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof -</strong> Down jackets don't have to be waterproof, but it certainly helps if they are at least water resistant. Down tends to clump when it gets wet, and when it clumps, it stops doing a very good job of insulating you from the cold. So it's a good idea to either have a waterproof down jacket, or to have a waterproof layer that you can throw over your down jacket if you think the weather could get ugly.</li>
	<li><strong>Quality of Down -</strong> There is a wide range of quality when it comes to down, which is referred to fill. A 800+ fill down jacket, for instance, is quite good, but not as good as a 900+ fill down jacket. What that <!--more-->number refers to is the loft of the down. The better loft the down has, the more insulation, or warmth, the down will give you, without adding any weight. Backpackers and campers in particular should be paying attention to the this number.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women's Down Jacket</h2>
The best of the best when it comes to women's down jackets.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/787088/patagonia-down-sweater-womens\">Patagonia Down Sweater</a> - First up, a great, basic down jacket from Patagonia. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and the polyester exterior has a <strong>water repellent finish</strong> that helps protect the down from moisture. It's missing features backpackers might look for, like a hood, but that means that it works well as a jacket for around town too. It <strong>weighs  11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-montebello-down-parka-womens\">Canada Goose Montebello Down Parka</a> - When you really, really want to stay warm, Canada Goose is the brand name you go to. The jacket only uses <strong>650+ fill duck down, but lots of it, to make this an extremely warm jacket</strong>. Features like a hood lined with coyote fur and a <strong>DWR finish</strong> on the exterior to keep water out will help keep you warm even in the worst conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ex-light-down-jacket-women-s\">Mont Bell EX Light Down Jacket</a> - The EX Light is light on features, but this helps it achieve what it is really going for, which is lightweight. The jacket <strong>weighs just 4.7 ounces, or 133 grams</strong>, which is far less than the comparable Patagonia jacket above. A big part of this weight saving is that EX Light is filled with <strong>900+ fill down, which is the good stuff</strong>. This is a women's down jacket that hikers, backpackers and campers can really appreciate.</li>

It doesn't have the warmth to weight ratio of something like down, but then fleece stands up well to water, unlike down. Fleece also blocks wind well, and wont rip or tear easily, like many other fabrics. It also helps that there are some very well designed <strong>fleece jackets for men</strong> out there, that both look good and keep you warm in all kinds of conditions.
<h2>Fleece Jackets for Men</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for fleece jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extras -</strong> If you want a fleece jacket that will perform well while backpacking, camping or hiking, then you should be looking for a fleece jacket with a few extras. Zippered pockets are useful to have in such situations, as are things like thumb holes on the sleeves and a hood too.</li>
	<li><strong>Fleece Thickness -</strong> The warmth you get from your fleece jacket will depend in large part on how thick and dense the fleece is. Thicker fleeces will keep you warm, but will not breath as well as <!--more-->thinner fleeces. It helps to know what kind of activities you will be doing in your fleece, and to then buy accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Fleece Jackets for Men</h2>
A few of the very best fleece jackets for men that are currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/monkey-man-jacket-men-s\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Jacket</a> -The Monkey Man jacket is made with <strong>thick, plush, furry fleece</strong>, which keeps you warm just like a coat of fur would, while not piling on the weight like you will find in other fleece jackets for men. The Monkey Man also has a very <strong>convenient zippered breast pocket</strong> to store a few small essential. The Monkey Man <strong>weighs 1 pound 2 ounces, or 514 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813740/the-north-face-windwall-2-fleece-jacket-mens\">The North Face WindWall 2 Fleece Jacket</a> - The Windfall 2 is similar in a lot of ways to the Monkey Man above, but without the thick, furry fleece.

All told, the WindWall 2 <strong>weighs 1 pound 13 ounces, or 822 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-r1-hooded-fleece-pullover-mens\">Patagonia R1 Hooded Fleece Pullover</a> - The R1 from Patagonia is the <strong>perfect fleece for an active lifestyle</strong>. You get a <strong>hood, a high zippered neck and extra long sleeves with thumb holes</strong>.

But the best hiking shirts will breath well, wick moisture away from you well, and dry well if you happen to get caught in a little rain. Of course there are different hiking T-shirts for men and women, but many of the details are the same.
<h2>Hiking T-Shirts</h2>
The features that you should be looking for when shopping for hiking T-shirts.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> There aren't many options to choose from when buying a hiking T-shirt, but material is a big one. Cotton T-shirts are easy to come by, but will absorb all of your sweat when you're active, and then leave you damp and possibly cold when you slow down. Blends <!--more-->of a variety of fabrics, like spandex, can be good, as can natural fabrics like wool, that shed moisture very well and maintain your warmth, regardless of how wet it is.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking T-Shirts</h2>
A few of the very best hiking T-shirts, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Best Hiking T-Shirts for Men</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-wicked-lite-t-shirt-short-sleeve-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Wicked Lite T-Shirt</a> - The Wicked Lite is a<strong> basic, polyester shirt</strong> great for hiking in, or just about anything else active. Polyester wicks moisture away from your skin well, and has an <strong>antimicrobial finish</strong> too, so you wont smell horrible after a long day on the trail.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/smartwool/mens-nts-microweight-tee\">Smartwool NTS Microweight Tee</a> - Wool is probably not the first material that most people think of when they think of hiking T-shirts, but it does make a great material for active wear. Keep in mind that this is <strong>not scratchy sweater wool, but thin, soft high quality wool</strong>. Wool is great because it wicks moisture well, will keep you warm even when wet, and best of all, is <strong>naturally antimicrobial</strong>, so you wont smell bad even after you've been sweating all day.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Best Hiking T-Shirts for Women</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810078/columbia-shadow-time-t-shirt-womens\">Columbia Shadow Time T-Shirt</a> - The Shadow Time is a blend of a few different fabrics. The end product is a <strong>stretchy, form fitting hiking T-shirt</strong>. It also has an <strong>Omni-Wick treatment</strong>, a product which helps wick moisture away from the skin, which is a definite must for any hiking T-shirt.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/smartwool-nts-microweight-t-shirt-short-sleeve-womens\">Smartwool NTS Microweight T-Shirt</a> - Similar to the NTS in the men's hiking T-shirts above, but with a women's fit. Wool is an ideal material because it <strong>wicks moisture well, keeps you warm even when wet, and has an antimicrobial finish</strong>. And it manages all that while being a natural fabric. Keep in mind that this is not itchy, sweater wool, but soft and thin wool that will feel great against the skin.</li>

Even if you have plenty of hair to cover up with, sun exposure to your face, for example, or the tops of your ears can do quite a bit of damage over a long enough period of time. For that reason, <strong>camping hats</strong> are a great idea. Camping hats can also do a lot more than just protect you from the sun, however. Many are ventilated very well, to keep you cool too, and some are even waterproof, so that you are covered from both rain and sun.
<h2>Camping Hats</h2>
Features to be on the lookout for when looking at camping hats.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - As with most camping gear, material is a big consideration when looking at new pieces of gear. When it comes to camping hats there is no shortage of choices, but nylon, which feels great against the skin, is lightweight and dries quickly, is <!--more-->an excellent choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Strap</strong> - The standard style of camping hat, with the wide brim all the way around the outside, can be one big wind catching device when the weather starts getting ugly. For that reason, it really pays to have a chin strap, ideally the adjustable kind that can be cinched up.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> - Another important feature for a camping hat to have is some ventilation. When you're working hard hiking along a trail, you are bound to sweat, and ventilation will do a lot to help alleviate a lot of sweat building up underneath your camping hat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Hats</h2>
There are many camping hats out there to choose from, but these are a few of the very best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-seattle-sombrero\">Outdoor Research Seattle Sombrero</a> - The Seattle Sombrero is something a little different from your average camping hat. It's actually <strong>made of Gore-Tex</strong>, which makes it waterproof. Gore-Tex probably is not the material that you want to be wearing in the sun, but if you like the camping hat aesthetic and want something to keep your head dry, this is an ideal choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721740/tilley-ltm6-airflo-hat\">Tilley LTM6 Airflo Hat</a> - The Airflo is more your standard camping hat. It's <strong>nylon, so it will dry quickly</strong>, and offers <strong>plenty of ventilation</strong> around the top of the hat so that you don't end up sweating too much. It has a <strong>UPF 50+ rating</strong> for the sun, and has a few nice extras, like a bit of foam built in so that it will float if it goes overboard.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bugsaway-adventure-hat-men-s\">ExOfficio Bugsaway Adventure Hat</a> - Another standard camping hat, but with a twist, which is a<strong> insect repellent coating</strong> which will repel mosquitoes and other annoying bugs away from the hat, and thus away from your head. Beyond that, the hat is <strong>nylon, so it will dry well, and has a UPF 30+ rating</strong>, for the sun.</li>

There are animals to see, certainly, and plenty of amazing terrain. A camera is perfect for capturing all these amazing sights, but cameras do not mix well with the dirt, moisture and the occasional fall that are a part of hiking. <strong>Camera backpacks for hiking</strong> are a good compromise, as they allow you to carry your camera and a few other things, but allow you to protect the camera from all of the dangers for a camera that are found in the outdors.
<h2>Camera Backpacks for Hiking</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for camera backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - It almost goes without saying, but any good camera backpack should be waterproof, or should have a storm cover of some sort so that you can make it waterproof when the rain starts falling. Just about any backpack will protect its contents from a few showers, but <!--more-->you need a truly waterproof camera backpack for when the rain really starts coming down.</li>
	<li><strong>Tripod Holder</strong> - Another feature you might want to look for on a camera backpack is somewhere to put a tripod or monopod. Even if you don't have a tripod, you might in the future, and all it takes is a few extra buckles to give you the ability to carry a tripod with you.</li>
</ul>

A good <strong>backpacking bowl</strong> can actually fill the role of bowl and plate as well, as long as it is big enough. And that really is the philosophy that backpackers should be trying for, to take as few items as possible, and to make those items as versatile as possible. But before you buy a backpacking bowl, it helps to do your homework and review the options available to you, because there are quite a few.
<h2>Backpacking Bowl</h2>
What features you should be looking for when shopping for backpacking bowls.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Versatile</strong> - If you want a straight bowl, and not something that is a hybrid of a bowl and a plate, then there are plenty of options out there, but if you want just one piece of gear that fills both roles, there are plenty of those to choose from too. At the very least, it's an <!--more-->option that you should be aware of when shopping for a new backpacking bowl.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - There are quite a few different materials out there to choose from when shopping for backpacking bowls. There are various plastics, and then there are also a variety of different kinds of metal that get used for bowls. Titanium is the best of the metals, but aluminum and stainless steel are also available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Bowl</h2>
A few of the better backpacking bowls out there right now.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-deep-dish-plate\">MSR Deep Dish Plate</a> - If you would prefer something that <strong>fills the role of bowl and plate equally well</strong>, then the Deep Dish is a great choice. It comes in <strong>three different sizes, ranging from a 6.75 diameter to a 8.75 diameter</strong>, and each size has a side wall that is <strong>1.7 inches high</strong>. The medium weighs a very reasonable <strong>2.6 ounces, or 75 grams</strong>, and the price is well under $10. If you only have to take food receptacle with you backpacking, this should be it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752844/guyot-designs-squishy-bowl-and-cup-set\">Guyot Designs Squishy Bowl and Cup</a> - This particular bowl <strong>won the 2007 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and with good reason, as it has one particular feature that will definitely appeal to backpackers.

As the name suggests its a <strong>bowl and cup set, the bowl weighing 3.3 ounces, or 93 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-bowl\">Snow Peak Titanium Bowl</a> - If all you want is a solid, standard sized bowl to take with you backpacking, a <strong>titanium bowl</strong> is a great choice.

A <strong>backpacking fire starter</strong> is so essential because fire is so essential. Even if you don't need fire for cooking you might very well end up needing it for warmth or an emergency situation. Most backpackers do, however, use a fire for cooking, and so it is a necessity for most backpackers. When starting a fire in the wilderness there are a number of different devices you can use, each with positives and negatives associated with them.
<h2>Backpacking Fire Starter</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for a new backpacking fire starter.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Windproof</strong> - A backpacking fire starter should be a couple of things, and one of them is windproof. It gets windy outside, after all, and you cant count on always starting a fire in ideal conditions. If you need a fire, you very likely will not be able to wait until the wind dies down.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - A good fire starter for backpacking should also be waterproof, or at least not damaged by water. Matches<!--more--> are a good example of a fire starting method that does not do well when wet, though there are some fairly good waterproof matches out there.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Fire Starter</h2>
A few of the better backpacking fire starters, in the different technology categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/e-gear-windmill-trekker-series-stormproof-lighter\">E-Gear Windmill Trekker Series Stormproof Lighter</a> - Lighters make good backpacking fire starters, but a <strong>stormproof lighter</strong> is even better. This thing will light in <strong>winds of up to 80 miles per hour</strong>, and when full of butane, will <strong>light roughly 1,000 times</strong>. It's refillable, of course, and <strong>waterproof</strong> too. In total it <strong>weighs 2.5 ounces, which is 70 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/gerber/bear-grylls-fire-starter?skus_all=true\">Gerber Bear Grylls Fire Starter</a> - Marketing gimmicks aside, this is actually a decent fire starter from Gerber, even if it does have Bear Grylls' name on it. It's a combination of <strong>ferrocerium starter and metal striker</strong>, that you pull apart, rubbing against each other, which creates a spark. One nice feature is that <strong>one end of the device is hollow, with a screw cap</strong>, so you can store a few fire starting accessories there. It <strong>weighs 2.6 ounces, which is 73 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762946/light-my-fire-swedish-firesteel-mini\">Light My Fire Swedish Fire Steel Mini</a> - This is one of many iterations of a classic fire starter device, the <strong>magnesium starter and the steel striker</strong>. You rub the two together, which produces a <strong>5,500 degree spark</strong>, which is more than hot enough to start a few fires. You will get <strong>roughly 1,500 strikes</strong> from the magnesium, and it <strong>weighs 1 ounce, which is 28 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fire Starting Accessories</h2>
It's often very helpful to bring some form of starter material with you, so that you don't have to find the kind of dry, easily flammable material that is generally required to get that initial flame going.

There is <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/631077/coghlans-emergency-tinder\">emergency tinder</a>, for example as well as <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/626906/coghlans-fire-paste\">fire paste</a>, both of which will light easily and burn for quite some time. From around the house, you might also try dryer lint, which often makes excellent starting material, and is something that most people should be able to get their hands on."

You can always add warmth to a summer sleeping bag by using a liner, but this is almost never the most efficient way to go about it. Better to have one summer sleeping bag, and one winter, or <strong>4 season sleeping bag</strong>, that you can use when the temperature dips down low. Winter sleeping bags do tend to cost a bit more, and it can seem like a bit of a hassle to have two sleeping bags, but if you want to save on weight, it's a requirement.
<h2>4 Season Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to look for when you are reviewing 4 season sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down</strong> - 4 season sleeping bags can get heavy, which is exactly why you want to get a down sleeping bag, as opposed to a synthetic sleeping bag. The one drawback of using a down sleeping bag as a <!--more-->winter sleeping bag is that down does not handle being wet nearly as well as synthetic insulation. So you have to be sure to keep your bag dry, but as long as you do that you are fine.</li>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> - A 4 season sleeping bag should absolutely have things like a hood, which comes standard on most sleeping bags anyway, and something else you may want to look in to is a draft collar, which sits around the neck and is meant to keep warm air down around your body. It might also be a good idea to get a sleeping bag with a face area that can be tightened down, so that you get a good seal around your face.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 4 Season Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the best 4 season sleeping bags on the market, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808964/marmot-plasma-15-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +15 Sleeping Bag</a> - First up, a 4 season sleeping bag for those who are lucky enough to live in a place with relatively mild winters. This sleeping bag is only <strong>rated down to 15 degrees</strong>, which isn't extremely cold. What this does mean, however, is that it would also be well suited to colder summers, making it potentially useful year round. Beyond that it uses <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is the high quality stuff, and uses a <strong>draft collar and drawcord hood</strong> to further insulate you from the cold. It weighs <strong>1.87 pounds, or 850 grams, and won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-antelope-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-5-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Antelope Gore WS Sleeping Bag</a> - Another very good four season sleeping bag, this one good down to <strong>5 degrees</strong>. This bag uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is very good quality, and actually has a <strong>Gore Windstopper outer</strong>, so if you think there's a chance you might get a little wet, that will help protect the down from moisture, and wind chill too. It also has a <strong>draft collar, and weighs 2.8 pounds, or 1.27 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down EXP</a> - For those that plan to venture out in to the real cold, there is the EXP from Mont Bell, which is <strong>good down to a very impressive -20 degrees</strong>. This sleeping bag pulls out all the stops to keep you warm, including a <strong>draft collar, a drawcord hood and Mont Bell's unique construction technique</strong>, where the sleeping bag is cut at a 45 degree angle, so that it coils around you. It <strong>weighs 3.43 pounds, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, which is a lot, but you have to remember that it's also good down to -20.</li>

So putting a little work in to finding <strong>cheap hiking backpacks</strong> can have a big payoff. Sales are always a good bet on finding a good price on a hiking backpack, but if you cant find anything you like on sale, you may need to do a little more research on what you want. But as long as you are willing to put a little work in, you should be able to find a cheap hiking backpack for your next outing.
<h2>Cheap Hiking Backpacks</h2>
What to look for when you want a lower price on a hiking backpack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Basic Design</strong> - Backpacks often come with quite a few extra features which, while often quite useful, also tend to drive the price up. Things like removable lids, advanced suspension systems and more exotic fabrics may be nice to have, but also cost more, and if you're looking to get a cheap hiking backpack, it's best to look for backpacks that lack most or all of these features.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> - Backpacks designed to be lightweight usually come with a higher price tag. You might think that less material would mean less cost, but lightweight <!--more-->backpacks often use more expensive fabrics or construction techniques to achieve those lighter weights, though there are some exceptions to this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Hiking Backpacks</h2>
A few of the better hiking backpacks with a low price point.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795972/the-north-face-terra-65-pack\">The North Face Terra 65 Pack</a> - (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-terra-55-backpack-womens-3350cu-in\">women's version</a>) A <strong>good, basic hiking backpack</strong> with a very respectable price. It doesn't have any advanced features, it's designed more for first time backpackers in mind. But it's top loading, with a sleeping bag compartment and compression straps in the right places, as well as a frame, so it has all the basics covered. At <strong>4.7 pounds, or 2.14 kilograms it is far from the lightest 65 liter backpack on the market</strong>, but for the price you cant expect much.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-atmos-50-backpack-2868-3234cu-in\">Osprey Atmos 50 Backpack</a> - (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-aura-65-backpack-3783-4150cu-in\">women's version</a>) The Atmos 50 is a <strong>50 liter backpack</strong> with a slightly higher price than the Terra. For the extra money you get a few nice features, like a hydration sleeve for a water bladder, and a lighter weight, at just <strong>3.4 pounds, or 1.54 kilograms</strong>, which even considering the decrease in volume is a better weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - The CDT is a great hiking backpack with an even better price. It's <strong>cheaper than either of the other two backpacks on the list</strong>, and is actually <strong>made in the USA</strong>, something that cant be said of many backpacking products. It gives you<strong> 52 liters of capacity</strong> to work with, and best of all, it <strong>weighs just 1.06 pounds, or 481 grams</strong>, which is just a fraction of the other two backpacks. But it's <strong>missing a few features, like an internal frame</strong>, that some people might consider essential, and the minimalist construction puts an upper limit on how much weight you can carry with this backpack, with the <strong>recommended max load being about 25 pounds</strong>. If you like lightweight gear, this is a great choice.</li>

The core functionality of a sleeping bag is to keep you warm, but for every temperature rating there is a wide variety of sleeping bags available, with a wide variety of weights. Picking up an <strong>ultralight sleeping bag</strong> that is made with better materials and construction techniques might end up costing you more, but you get paid by many times over in the increased enjoyment most people get from having to carry less weight while backpacking.
<h2>Ultralight Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to look for to make sure that you get an ultralight sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation Material</strong> - First and foremost, the weight of your sleeping bag will be determined by the material it is insulated with. The basic choice is down or synthetic, with down being the lighter of the two. Within the down category there is a whole range of qualities of down, with higher numbers for better quality down. 800+ fill down is<!--more--> quite good, for instance, but you can get the same amount of warmth with less down by using 900+ fill down.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - The rectangular sleeping bags that many people grow up using are hugely inefficient because there is a lot of wasted space inside the sleeping bag. It's a waste in that it's material not needed, and also in that your body heat gets used to heat that dead space within the sleeping bag. Which is why mummy sleeping bags are a better choice than rectangular.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Sleeping Bags</h2>
Here are a few of the better ultralight sleeping bags out there, across a range of temperature choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite Sleeping Bag</a> - On the cooler side of things there is something like the HighLite, which has a <strong>temperature rating of 35 degrees</strong>. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is very high quality, and weighs just <strong>1 pound, or 453 grams</strong>, which is extremely ultralight. 35 degrees is fairly warm, so you likely don't want to use this sleeping bag outside of summer conditions, but for its temperature rating it is an extremely ultralight sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +30 Sleeping Bag</a> - At a slightly warmer temperature rating of <strong>30 degrees</strong> there is the Plasma. This sleeping bag <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It uses <strong>900+ fill down</strong>, which is extremely high quality, and <strong>weighs 1.37 pounds, or 637 grams</strong>, which is impressively lightweight. 30 degrees is warm enough for summer just about everywhere, and even some spring and fall conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down #1 Sleeping Bag</a> - If you're looking for something with a slightly lower temperature rating that can handle spring, summer or fall with ease, this is a good choice from Mont Bell. It's <strong>good down to 15 degrees</strong>, and uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, along with a few features like a draft collar and Mont Bell's special biased construction technique to get there. It weighs a very respectable <strong>2.25 pounds, which is 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>

One is that men are bigger, generally, and so the backpack needs to be bigger, to fit that bigger torso. Another reason is that a good rule of thumb is to carry a certain percentage of your body weight, for comfort's sake, and so for a bigger, heavier man, 30% of body weight will be a bigger number than it is for a smaller woman, and that extra weight means extra room in the backpack.
<h2>Hiking Backpacks for Men</h2>
What to look for when you are buying a men's hiking backpack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - If you're going to be carrying a backpack, there's no reason to find a lightweight backpack, so that you don't end up carrying too much weight. Some backpacks can be quite heavy <!--more-->all by themselves, and that's before you put anything in them, so do yourself a favor and find a lightweight hiking backpack. Your legs and back will thank you.</li>
	<li><strong>Features</strong> - Hiking backpacks can come with all sorts of different features, depending on what your needs are. Frames, for example, are great for carrying heavy loads, but are unnecessary weight for lighter loads. Think about what features you will need from your backpack, and then look for backpacks that fit the description.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Backpacks for Men</h2>
A few of the very best hiking backpacks for men.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam Backpack</a> - The Jam is on the smaller side, with just <strong>50 liters of storage capacity</strong>, but for many hikers and backpackers that plan right, that is all that's needed. The small size comes with a small weight, however, at just <strong>1.8 pounds, or 840 grams</strong>. Part of why it's so lightweight is that it has <strong>no frame</strong>, which may appeal to lightweight backpackers, but perhaps not to those who don't mind extra weight, and need that frame. Besides that it's a fairly basic backpack, with no sleeping bag compartment, water bottle pockets on the side and a few convenient pockets on the hip belt for easy access to a few small essentials.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824361/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-pack\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60 Pack</a> - A slightly bigger backpack, at <strong>60 liters</strong>, the Blaze <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. Like the Jam it has a simplified design, with no sleeping bag compartment and just a roll top and drawstring closure. It does have a frame, unlike the Jam, and makes up for a lack of features with a relatively <strong>low weight of 2.8 pounds, or 1.3 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit Backpack</a> - ULA Equipment is likely well known to lightweight backpackers, but probably not to everyone else. They make fantastic products right in the USA, however, and the Circuit is the perfect example of that. It's big, at <strong>68 liters, but also very light, at 2.25 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>. It also has some great features for such a low weight such as a <strong>frame, hip belt pockets and a mesh exterior pocket</strong>, which is a useful place to put wet clothes to dry as you walk. In all, a fantastic blend of lightweight materials and good design.</li>

The tent you bring should also be sturdy and weatherproof. Family camping is often an introduction to camping and backpacking in general, and if you want to give everyone the impression that camping can be a fun and rewarding experience, you should be looking for the <strong>best family tent</strong> you can get your hands on, to make the experience a rewarding one.
<h2>Best Family Tent</h2>
Features to watch for when shopping for the best family tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Depending on how big the family is, the size of your tent will of course vary. Just be sure to get the right size, as tent dimensions tend to be fairly specific, and it’s unlikely that a 4 person tent, for example, will have enough room for more than four people to squeeze in without things getting crowded.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Car camping can be fun, but if you plan to do any real camping, where you actually have to carry the tent, it pays to invest in a tent that doesn’t weigh a <!--more-->whole lot. There can be several pounds of difference between tents of the same size, which can make a big difference over several hours of walking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Family Tent Reviews</h2>
A select few of the best family tents on the market to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-copper-spur-ul3-tent-3-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Copper Spur UL3</a> - For smaller families of just three, something like the Copper Spur is ideal. It <strong>won the 2008 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and while it would be fine for car camping it's also the kind of tent that would carry well in a backpack, with a <strong>weight of just 4.18 pounds, or 1.89 kilograms</strong>. Not the lightest 3 person tent around, but certainly not the heaviest either. It features <strong>2 doors</strong>, which is a nice touch, and a fairly standard ventilated inner tent with an optional rain fly, so that you're good for a wide variety of conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-4-tent\">Big Agnes FLy Creek UL 4</a> - Something slightly bigger from Big Agnes is the Fly Creek, with a capacity of 4. This is another <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award winner, this one from 2010</strong>. It <strong>weighs 4.06 pounds, or 1.84 kilograms,</strong> which is, you'll notice, slightly less than the smaller Copper Spur above. So it might be a worthwhile investment, especially if you're the one carrying the tent. Like the Copper Spur, it's a well ventilated, 2 wall tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777755/rei-base-camp-6-tent\">REI Base Camp 6</a> - If you're looking for s<strong>omething a little bigger, and maybe something a little cheaper too</strong>, the Base Camp from REI is a great choice. It sleeps 6, and is a tough tent that will stand up well in a variety of conditions. But this is definitely not a tent that you could take backpacking, like the two above. With a <strong>weight of 17.18 pounds, or 7.79 kilograms, you had better hope you're not the one carrying it</strong>. That said, it has a lot of features that are welcome in a larger tent, like 2 doors and a large vestibule. A great choice for car camping with the family.</li>

Shoes have a couple of important advantages over boots, the biggest one being weight. Shoes weigh a lot less, and you end up expending a lot less energy wearing shoes instead of boots. Men’s and <strong>women’s hiking shoes</strong> are a little different, of course, but metrics like weight are equally important, regardless of the intended gender of the hiking shoes. With lightweight hiking shoes, you can go farther and feel fresher when you get there.
<h2>Women’s Hiking Shoes</h2>
Things to try and find on a new pair of women’s hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As alluded to above, weight is important when it comes to shoes. Every pound on your feet is equivalent to about 5 pounds on your back, in terms of energy expenditure. You wouldn’t fill <!--more-->your backpack with unnecessary weight, so don’t put unnecessary weight on your feet by getting a heavy pair of hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof or Breathable</strong> – The more waterproof a pair of hiking shoes are, the less breathable they will tend to be. There are some materials, like certain kinds of Gore Tex, for example, that do a decent job of giving you both, but generally, you have to choose one or the other and go with it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Hiking Shoes</h2>
A select few of the better women's hiking shoes that are available to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-women-s\">Montrail Mountain Masochist</a> - If you'd prefer something <strong>lightweight and minimalist</strong>, then the Mountain Masochist is an ideal choice for you. It's <strong>very breathable, and not at all waterproof</strong>, making it a great choice for good weather conditions. It has a low profile and not much in the way of features, besides being well made. What really stands out about the Mountain Masochist is the weight, which averages just <strong>18.4 ounces, or 514 grams for the pair</strong>, which is quite a bit lighter than most other hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-siren-sport-gtx-xcr-shoe-womens\">Merrell Siren Sport GTX XCR</a> - This is a hiking shoe that occupies the <strong>waterproof end of the waterproof / breathability spectrum</strong>. It does use the <strong>XCR version of Gore-Tex, which is supposed to be a little more breathable</strong>, so there's that. They also have a <strong>vibram sole</strong>, which is a definite plus. At <strong>1.5 pounds, or 680 grams</strong>, they're not too much heavier than the Mountain Masochists, which makes them a good hiking shoe option for women who want to stay dry.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795722/salomon-xt-wings-2-trail-running-shoes-womens\">Salomon XT Wings 2</a> - The XT Wings 2 are something more suited to those that want a sturdy, hefty hiking shoe. With these shoes you get <strong>plenty of support, cushioning and comfort</strong>. All that comfort does have a cost in weight, however, because at <strong>23 ounces, or 650 grams, they're only marginally lighter than the Merrell shoes above, and these aren't waterproof</strong> like the Merrells. But if you want padding and support, you cant expect to have the lightest pair of hiking shoes.</li>

But winter often packs a punch that can damage or at least show the faults of a lesser 3 season tent. So for winter camping, a <strong>4 season tent</strong> is required. 4 season tents are typically built to withstand the wind and snow that often accompanies winter camping or backpacking. They have better fabric, and crucially, a more robust pole structure. They also tend to weigh a bit more, which cant really be helped, since the objective is a more weatherproof tent.
<h2>4 Season Tent</h2>
Features to try and find on a new 4 Season Tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Pole Structure</strong> – Make sure that any 4 season tent you get has several poles, so that the structure of the tent has some strength, and wont be blown around easily. It’s also worth trying to get a tent with sleeves for the poles, rather than clips, which are easier to set up, but also run the risk of becoming unclipped in severe weather.</li>
	<li><strong>Profile</strong> – To shed wind effectively, you want a 4 season tent with a<!--more--> low profile. There are some exceptions to this, but generally these tents will shed wind better, and will not be as susceptible to damage.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 4 Season Tent</h2>
A few of the very best 4 season tents that you will find out there on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795544/the-north-face-mountain-25-tent\">The North Face Mountain 25 Tent</a> - First up, a<strong> well built, 2 person tent</strong> from The North Face. This certainly isn't the lightest 2 person tent, at <strong>8 pounds 8 ounces, or 3.86 kilograms</strong>, but then weight shouldn't be your chief concern when shopping for a 4 season tent, your chief concern should be how well the tent can survive winter conditions. With <strong>5 poles, an internal guyout system, and a low profile</strong>, the Mountain 25 survives exceptionally well. And with thoughtful features like <strong>plenty of ventilation, 2 doors and plenty of pocket space inside</strong>, you will be able to ride out bad weather in comfort.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-bombshelter-tent-4-person-4-season\">Black Diamond Bombshelter Tent</a> - A bigger tent, with <strong>room for 4</strong>, this thing survives wind and snow with relative ease. Only <strong>4 poles, but they intersect a total of 7 times</strong>, so you can expect only a minimal amount of bending and flexing. The <strong>2 doors</strong> is ideal for 4 people, and the weight is also relatively light, at<strong> 8 pounds 13 ounces, or 4 kilograms</strong>, which is only slightly heavier than the much smaller Mountain 25 above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/twin-sisters-shelter-2-person\">MSR Twin Sisters Shelter</a> - This is something a bit different. It's actually a <strong>tarp, meaning that it has no floor, but has a snow shield around the bottom</strong> of the tent to keep out blowing wind and snow. And while you can use poles, it works equally well with <strong>trekking poles or ski poles as supports</strong>, making it a fantastic lightweight option for 2 people. At just <strong>2 pounds 1 ounce, or 940 grams</strong>, it's significantly lighter than either of the tents above.</li>

The <strong>best backpacks for backpacking</strong> are, beyond anything else, lightweight. Backpacking is hard work, and the reason for that is that you have to carry everything you bring on your back. Most people don’t think about it, but the backpack itself is one of the heavier items that you will bring with you. So do yourself a favour and get a lightweight backpack, though make sure it’s big enough to carry everything else too.
<h2>Best Backpacks for Backpacking</h2>
Features to watch for when trying to find the best backpacks for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – Backpackers have to carry everything they’ll be using, and that includes the backpack itself. Backpack weights can vary quite a bit, and it really does pay to get a lighter backpack. If you<!--more--> can manage to get the weight of your backpacking equipment down far enough you can get in to things like frameless backpacks, which are very lightweight.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Something else you need to pay close attention to when choosing a backpack for backpacking is the capacity of the backpack. You need to carry all your gear, of course, but you also need to account for things like water and food, the amount of which will vary quite a bit, depending on the length of the trip and the conditions on the trail.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacks for Backpacking Reviews</h2>
A few of the very best backpacks to take backpacking with you, that will have your friends drooling.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - You've probably not heard of ULA Equipment, but they make some excellent backpacks aimed at lightweight backpackers, and they do it in the USA, which is more than most backpacking manufacturers can say. The Circuit is one of their most popular backpacks, and at just <strong>2.25 pounds, or 1.02 kilograms for 68 liters of capacity</strong>, it's not hard to see why. Beyond those basics, there are a number of features, like a <strong>sleeve for a hydration bladder, pockets on the hip belt and big external mesh pocket</strong> that is useful for letting wet clothes dry while walking, for instance, that make this a favorite with many backpackers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam</a> - On the smaller side of things, at just <strong>50 liters</strong>, is the Jam from another lightweight manufacturer, GoLite. It's actually<strong> frameless</strong>, so you wouldn't want to carry much more weight than 25 or 30 pounds, but that shouldn't be a problem for most lightweight backpackers. It doesn't have too many frills, but does have a <strong>sleeve for a hydration bladder and pockets on the hip belt</strong>, both of which backpackers will appreciate. It also <strong>only weighs 1.85 pounds, or 840 grams</strong>, something else that backpackers will definitely appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/764214/osprey-argon-85-pack\">Osprey Argon 85</a> (Women's <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/764211/osprey-xenon-85-pack-womens\">Osprey Xenon 85</a>) - At the almost needlessly large end of the scale there is the Argon 85. <strong>85 liters</strong> is too much space for most people, but some might be interested in the bevy of features available. A <strong>big sturdy frame and a back panel</strong> with air flow channels is joined by a removable lid for day packing, multiple access points to the main pocket and plenty of external pockets too. If you want big and feature rich, this is a great choice, but at <strong>6.43 pounds or 2.92 kilograms</strong>, prepare to be worn out at the end of the day.</li>

You don’t want to overload yourself with gear and ingredients, but at the same time you want to have a good, hot meal after a day of camping. It’s a great way to end a day in the outdoors. For some people a <strong>camping grill pan</strong> is a luxury, but there are a lot of great things that you can make with a grill pan that you just cant get down with a pot. It might seem like a bit of a luxury to some, but to those that like to go beyond the basics when it comes to camping food, it might just be a necessity.
<h2>Camping Grill Pan</h2>
Things you may want to pay attention to when you are reviewing camping grill pans.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re bringing along a camping grill pan in addition to a camping pot, then you need to think hard about the weight of your pan. Taking along a whole kitchen set rather than just a few essentials can get heavy fast, and if you’re carrying all that kitchen stuff in a backpack, you might be regretting taking along that extra pan or pot after a few miles.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – Related to weight, you have to decide on a material for your pan. The three metals you will find<!--more--> camping cookware in are stainless steel, aluminum and titanium. Titanium is the lightest, but also the most expensive, while aluminum is light but delicate, and stainless steel heavy but durable.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Grill Pan</h2>
A few of the better camping grill pans that you have a choice of when shopping for a new one.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783955/msr-flex-skillet\">MSR Flex Skillet</a> - First up, a <strong>non-stick coated aluminum</strong> grill pan from MSR. It's a fairly basic pan with <strong>straight corners, rather than rounded sides</strong>. The handles attaches and detaches easily on the outside bracket, so that you don't need to use a traditional pot grabber, which might scratch the non-stick inside. The pot is <strong>9 inches in diameter, and weighs 7 ounces, or 198 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cookware-3pcs\">Snow Peak Titanium Cookware</a> - This is a <strong>pan as well as two pots</strong>. Most campers take a pot for sure, and then add a pan on to that, so if you don't already have the pot, this is an ideal set. The <strong>grill pan doubles as a lid for either pot</strong>, and each piece in the set has a <strong>folding handle</strong> that makes it simple pick up each piece. The <strong>whole set also only weighs 7 ounces, or 198 grams</strong>, which is the same as just the MSR skillet above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/frypan\">Jetboil Frypan</a> - Another grill pan, this one from Jetboil. Jetboil has a unique bottom to this pan that is supposed to heat up quicker and distribute heat better than other pans. One more thing that stands out about this pot is <strong>rounded edges</strong>, which makes it easier to flip and mix whatever you're cooking. The pan has an <strong>8.1 inch diameter and weighs 10 ounces or 280 grams</strong>, however, which is a fair bit more than either of the other two options above.</li>

A pillow is something that almost everyone uses, and is extremely used to. Getting to sleep without it can be difficult, then, and many people find that it’s worth it to take along the extra bulk and weight, so that they get a good night of sleep in. Fortunately, you don’t need to bring along a whole pillow, in fact the <strong>best camping pillow</strong> for you may be small enough to throw in your backpack and forget about until you need it.
<h2>Best Camping Pillow</h2>
A few things to be on the lookout for when shopping for a new camping pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Padding Method</strong> – Most people will immediately think of foam camping pillows, but just like sleeping pads, foam is not your only choice. There are in fact many inflatable camping pillows out there, which pack down small and offer plenty of comfort, making them serious competition for the foam pillows.</li>
	<li><strong>Surface</strong> – Ideally you want a camping pillow with a nice, soft surface to sleep against. Foam pillows tend to do well in this category, but with inflatable pillows you might get stuck <!--more-->with a nylon surface, for instance, which isn’t the most comfortable surface to sleep with your head against.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Pillow Reviews</h2>
A few of the best camping pillows around, in a few different categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - First up, a great <strong>inflatable pillow</strong> from Mont Bell. It's definitely an lightweight product, and is one of, if not the light inflatable camping pillow on the market. It doesn't have much in the way of contouring, however, and lacks a soft surface to lay your head against. But you cant beat a lack of bulk and a weight of just <strong>2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - In the more traditional foam pillow category there is this entry from Therm-A-Rest. The good thing about it is that it has a <strong>built in compression sack</strong>, so that it does get quite small when you need to put it back in your backpack. It also comes in <strong>three different sizes</strong>, for those that can make do with a small camping pillow, or those that need something bigger. The one real downside is that it <strong>weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, which is considerably more than the inflatable Mont Bell camping pillow above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719845/therm-a-rest-trekker-pillowcase\">Therm-A-Rest Trekker Pillowcase</a> - If you're willing to be a little innovative, and you have a few bulkier pieces of clothing at your disposal, a <strong>pillow case</strong> might be exactly what you need. And while there's nothing wrong with bringing a simple pillow case from home, this one has a <strong>microbrushed surface that helps to smooth over some of the edges</strong> that the clothing you stuff inside it might have. Being that it's just a case it <strong>compresses down very small, and weighs just 2.3 ounces, which is 65 grams</strong>.</li>

The capacity of the tent, for instance, as well as the weather it’s intended for. 3 season tents are ideal for summer, for example, but might be seriously damaged in a winter storm. Doing your research is important before you make a decision.
<h2>Outdoor Tents</h2>
Things to watch for when you are reviewing outdoor tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – When it comes to outdoor tents you need to buy for the right amount of people. You also need to plan ahead. You may just go by yourself the first time, but next time there may be two of you. Having several tents is one option, of course, but 2 people fit in a 3 man tent just as easily as 3 people do.</li>
	<li><strong>Season</strong> – Most people stick to three season camping, which is spring, summer and fall, but if you enjoy winter <!--more-->camping it’s advisable to get a four season tent. You may want to consider a tent for each use, however, as four season tents can be quite a bit heavier than three season tents.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Outdoor Tents</h2>
A few of the very best outdoor tents for taking camping, hiking or backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-tadpole-23-bx-tent-2-person-3-season.html\">The North Face Tadpole</a> - If all you want is <strong>something basic that wont put a huge dent in your wallet</strong>, the Tadpole is an ideal choice. With <strong>room for 2 and a weight of 4 pounds 10 ounces or 2.09 kilograms</strong> it's certainly not going to break any weight records, but then you typically have to pay more to go lighter. But the interior walls are all mesh, which provides plenty of ventilation, and it has a big vestibule for transitioning from tent to outdoors and back again. Not lightweight, but certainly not lacking in any other way.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL3</a> - If you're ready to make the jump to a lightweight outdoor tent, the Fly Creek line from Big Agnes is an ideal choice. This one will <strong>fit three and weighs 3 pounds 3 ounces, or 1.45 kilograms</strong>, which is, you'll notice, significantly better than the heavier, smaller Tadpole above. It also <strong>won the 2010 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, which just helps to make it a better choice. Best of all, it comes in a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\">1 person</a>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\">2 person</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807372/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent\">4 person</a> version.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fitzroy-tent\">Black Diamond Fitzroy</a> - If you want something that will handle winter weather with ease you need a <strong>4 season tent</strong>. The Fitzroy is such a tent. It has <strong>room for 2, and weighs 6 pounds 4 ounces, or 2.85 kilograms</strong>, but then 4 season tents are rarely lightweight. What it does come with is a number of 4 season design features, like <strong>2 doors, a single wall design and a total of 4 poles</strong> to increase strength and stability in bad weather.</li>

Navigation is important, after all, and the last thing you want to do is get lost and have to break out your survival kit. And if you like the beaten trail, and only want a backpacking compass to stick in your survival kit for emergencies, there are plenty of options for that too. Just remember that a compass is a tool, and if you don’t know how to use the tool, it wont be of any use to you.
<h2>Backpacking Compass</h2>
Features to try and find when you're shopping for a backpacking compass.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Declination</strong> – Whether or not you get a compass with an adjustable declination depends on just how much you plan to be using it. If you’re relying on a compass and map for your route, you will definitely want a compass with an adjustable declination. But if you’re throwing a compass in to your backpack on the off chance that you will need it to find north, declination is much less of a concern.</li>
	<li><strong>Sighting Mirror</strong> – Another feature that those looking to do some serious navigation with their compass will likely want is a sighting mirror. It’s not a required <!--more-->feature, but it allows you to line up the compass needle and distant features of the landscape in your field of vision, so that you can make your direction of travel as accurate as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Compass</h2>
Some of the best backpacking compasses for your next outdoor trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-15tdcl-mirrored-compass.html\">Brunton Mirrored Compass</a> - This compass from Brunton is a great compass with everything that a backpacker needs to navigate through the wilderness. The <strong>sighting mirror</strong> allows you to see the compass face and the terrain at the same time, while the <strong>adjustable declination</strong> will allow you to take accurate readings, so that you don't drift. It <strong>weighs 3 ounces, or 85 grams</strong>, and comes with a lanyard.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/408150/suunto-m-3d-leader-compass\">Suunto M-3D Leader Compass</a> - Another compass, this one from Suunto. It has an <strong>adjustable declination, but no sighting mirror</strong>. It's still an excellent compass, but if you're taking frequent readings you may want find that you want that sighting mirror. But still, you will at least be taking accurate readings with the adjustable declination. It comes with a lanyard, and <strong>weighs 1.6 ounces, or 45 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/9041-glow-mate-compass\">Brunton 9041 Glow Mate Compass</a> - This compass is on the very basic end of things. It <strong>doesn't have an adjustable declination or a sighting mirror</strong>, it's more the kind of thing you throw in your bag just in case. What it does have is a key ring, to put it somewhere handy and easy to get to, and a luminous background, so that you can take readings at night, though navigating at night is not always the best idea. But <strong>as a just in case compass it does a good job. It weighs .5 ounces, or 14 grams</strong>.</li>

Sun reflecting off of water, for instance, or snow if you’re up high can be irritating and even damaging to your eyes if you’re exposed to it for long enough. Even a cheap pair of backpacking sunglasses, however, will go a long ways towards preventing irritation from the sun for your eyes, and will keep you looking stylish in the outdoors too.
<h2>Backpacking Sunglasses</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for new backpacking sunglasses.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Polarized</strong> – Polarization is a nice feature to have, particularly if you’re going to be around a lot of water. For most backpacking, it’s not the most important feature to have, but if you plan <!--more-->on using your backpacking sunglasses for other things, like spending time on the water, for instance, polarized sunglasses certainly wont negatively affect your backpacking experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Durability</strong> – Backpacking is rarely friendly to delicate gear, and a delicate pair of sunglasses is not something that you want to take backpacking. They fall off, get left in the dirt and squished in pockets, and so it can pay to have a cheap pair of sunglasses that you take backpacking with you, and then leave the expensive pair at home.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Sunglasses</h2>
A few of the best backpacking sunglasses that you can choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722629/chilis-bluefin-polarized-sunglasses\">Chili's Bluefin Polarized Sunglasses</a> - If what you want in a pair of sunglasses is something that has a <strong>low price, so that you wont be overly worried about damaging</strong> them, then these are a great choice. They're <strong>polarized</strong>, which helps to cut down on glare from water and snow, and have <strong>grippy rubber on the temple ends</strong> so that they will stay in place. <strong>They're nothing fancy, with a price to match</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/oakley-straight-jacket-sunglasses.html\">Oakley Straight Jacket Sunglasses</a> - If what you're looking for is something a little higher end but with that same basic, sporty look, then these are ideal. They're <strong>not polarized, but have some excellent optics, courtesy of Oakley</strong>, that make it easy to wear these all day long without fatiguing your eyes. They also have <strong>rubber grips on the arms</strong> so that you can be sure they wont go anywhere.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/maui-jim-hookipa-sunglasses-polarized.html\">Maui Jim Ho'okipa Sunglasses</a> - These sunglasses from Maui Jim are more the kind of thing that work just as well on the trail as they do on the street. <strong>Polarized lenses</strong> make them useful for water, snow and anywhere else where glare is a problem. The <strong>nylon frames are a step up from the basic plastic</strong> of most other outdoor sunglasses. <strong>These aren't cheap, but if you want one pair of sunglasses for everything, these are a good choice</strong>.</li>

But for some people, coffee falls more in the necessity column than the luxury column, and <strong>camping coffee makers</strong> are a required item for any overnight trip. Fortunately, there are many excellent camping coffee makers that come in smart, lightweight, small packages, and you really don’t have to add much weight or bulk to your backpack to get your coffee in the morning.
<h2>Camping Coffee Makers</h2>
What to think about when you're buying your next camping coffee maker.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> – There are a few different ways that you can make coffee while camping. Something like a French press is certainly a viable options, as it’s low tech and would work well in a camping scenario. There are also options, such as an immersion filter, that you’ve probably never considered, but which make an excellent cup of coffee without adding much weight to your backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Integrated</strong> – It helps if your coffee maker integrates in some way with the rest of your cookware. If your coffee<!--more--> making method requires a pot, for instance, then it would be a good idea to see if you can use your cooking pot. That way, you only have to bring one pot, which is then used for two different purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Makers</h2>
A few of the better camping coffee makers, of several different varieties.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee / Tea Filter</a> - If what you want is something <strong>simple, small and lightweight</strong>, the MugMate is a fantastic choice. It <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold Award</strong>, and has a design that is likely familiar to many people. It looks and functions very similar to a tea immersion filter, and as the name suggests, it can be used for tea as well as coffee. Of course it's reusable an endless amount of times, and is easy to store in your cup when not in use. It also <strong>weighs just 1 ounce, or 28 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press.html\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - If you prefer your coffee from a <strong>french press</strong>, Snow Peak makes an excellent titanium option. It will <strong>make two cups of coffee</strong>, for you and a friend or one really big one for just you. The pot portion, of course, could also <strong>double as a cooking pot</strong>, making it a versatile option for that want to save on bulk. The whole thing <strong>weighs 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snow Peak Folding Coffee Drip</a> - And finally, if you prefer your coffee dripped, there is an excellent camping option for that too, also from Snow Peak. It's <strong>stainless steel</strong>, and assembles so that it will sit conveniently on the top of your cup and drip away while you do other things around camp. <strong>When you're done with it, it folds down for easy packing</strong>, making it an ideal solution for backpackers and campers. It <strong>weighs 4.9 ounces, or 138 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Camping Coffee Cup</h2>
If you're going to be drinking a lot of coffee when you're in the outdoors then it pays to have a good cup to drink from. A <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">double walled cup</a> will hold in the heat better, allowing your coffee to stay hot longer, and will also help to shield your hands from some of the heat of the hot coffee, so you don't burn yourself."

If you do any of these activities in bear country enough, you’ll see a bear sooner or later. And while bear attacks are extremely rare, they do happen. If you take the time to <strong>buy bear spray</strong>, educate yourself on how to use it and most importantly, keep it accessible, you might one day find yourself needing it.
<h2>Buy Bear Spray</h2>
Features to look at when you're buying bear spray.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Spray Time</strong> – The more spray there is inside your bear spray, the longer you will be able to spray for. Even with a large can, however, you will only have a few seconds, and so it’s important that you know how much spray you have to work with, and that you aim it and use it as well as possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Distance</strong> – Bigger cans of bear spray also tend to spray farther. Remember that this isn’t like a can of pepper spray that you use for self defense. Ideally you want to be spraying the<!--more--> bear before it’s anywhere near you. If you wait until it’s just a few feet away, the bear will likely run you over, even if it’s no longer interested in you, just from momentum.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bear Spray Reviews</h2>
There aren't many different bear sprays to choose from, but these are some of the best.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray</a> (230 g) - This smaller canister of bear spray gives you<strong> approximately 7 seconds of spray and that spray will go between 12 and 30 feet</strong>. If you're concerned about weight, the canister <strong>weighs 11 ounces, or 311 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray</a> (290 g) - This larger canister of bear spray gives you <strong>approximately 9 seconds of spray and the spray goes somewhere between 12 and 32 feet</strong>. So slightly longer and slightly farther than the smaller canister. It also weighs slightly more, at <strong>15 ounces, which is 425 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Counter Assault Bear Deterrent Spray Holster</a> - While bear spray can be an extremely useful tool to have at your disposal in a bear encounter, it wont be much good if you cant get it out in time. Carrying it in your backpack, for instance, means you have to get the backpack off, unzipped and then you have to get the bear spray out before it can be used. In that time, a bear could easily be on you. <strong>A holster dramatically shortens the time it takes to get that bear spray out</strong>. This particular holster will<strong> fit either of the two canisters above</strong>, will thread easily on to a belt, and has just one velco strap securing the bear canister in place, which means it's easy to access. If you're serious about carrying bear spray then consider buying a bear spray holster.</li>

<h2>Cold Weather Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for cold weather tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Poles</strong> – One of the main threats of cold, winter weather for a tent is wind. Winds tend to be worse in the winter, though this does depend quite a bit on where you are. But generally, cold weather tents come with more poles, so that they are stronger and better able to weather strong gusts of wind.</li>
	<li><strong>Profile</strong> – Cold weather tents also tend to have a relatively low, or sloping profile. This helps when snow <!--more-->starts falling, so that it doesn’t pile up, but even more so, it helps to deflect wind. A traditional family dome tent has a much larger profile, and will get battered around a lot more by even mild winds.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cold Weather Tents</h2>
A few of the better cold weather tents on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-fitzroy-tent-3-person-4-season.html\">Black Diamond Fitzroy Tent</a> - If what you want is a good, solid cold weather tent, the Fitzroy is an excellent choice. It has just <strong>4 poles, but they intersect an impressive 7 times</strong>, which adds quite a bit of strength for surviving winter winds. It's a <strong>roomy 2 person tent and can fit 3</strong>, though it might be a bit cramped with that third person. Still, that's not necessarily a bad thing when camping in cold temperatures. Beyond that it has <strong>2 doors, for good ventilation, and weighs 6 pounds 5 ounces, which is 2.86 kilograms</strong>. Not a bad weight for a cold weather tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/739354/rei-mountain-2-tent\">REI Mountain 2 Tent</a> - If you would prefer something a <strong>little cheaper</strong> for winter camping, the Mountain 2 from REI is ideal. It <strong>has room for 2</strong>, and all the standard features, like <strong>2 doors and 5 poles</strong>, that you would expect to find on a cold weather tent. And while the price is still high, it's lower than most other four season tents that you'll find. But it isn't especially lightweight, at <strong>8 pounds, or 3.63 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/twin-sisters-shelter-2-person\">MSR Twin Sisters Shelter</a> - If you don't mind something a little different, the Twin Sisters is a fantastic choice that <strong>sleeps 2</strong> for winter campers and backpackers. This is actually <strong>a tarp, meaning it has no floor</strong>. That said, it is rated for four season use, and has some impressive snow flaps that will keep wind and blowing snow out down at the ground level. Obviously it's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, but does have <strong>two doors, plus ventilation at either peak</strong>, to keep you dry at night. What really sets it apart, however, is that you can <strong>use trekking poles or ski poles as the poles for the tent</strong>, which helps to cut down on weight. And at <strong>2 pounds 3 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>, this is by far the lightest option on this list.</li>

Of course the minimum temperature of your sleeping will depend on a lot of things, not least being your own body temperature and what kind of sleeper you. Cold sleepers, for instance, should invest in an extra warm sleeping bag.
<h2>Warm Sleeping Bags</h2>
Features to look for when trying to decide on a warm sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Minimum Temperature</strong> – The conditions that you’re using your sleeping bag in, along with the season that you’re going in will help to determine what kind of minimum temperature you should be looking in a sleeping bag. Just remember that if you’re a cold sleeper it would be a good idea to add a few degrees to that number.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – When it comes to sleeping bag warmth, a mummy shaped sleeping bag is a better investment than a rectangular sleeping<!--more--> bag. A mummy sleeping saves on both weight and bulk, but more importantly, it eliminates dead space inside the sleeping bag that absorbs your body heat and doesn’t give anything back.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Warm Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the better warm sleeping bags, at a few different temperature points.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma +30</a> - If you're looking for a warm 3 season sleeping bag you won't do much better than the Plasma, which has a <strong>minimum temperature of 30 degrees</strong>. It uses very <strong>high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, which provides more warmth for less weight than any other insulation material. It also has a <strong>draft collar</strong>, to keep the warm air that your body generates inside the sleeping, and also keep the cold air out. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you can be assured it's a high quality product. It <strong>weighs 1 pound 6 ounces, which is 630 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down #1</a> - With a lower minimum <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong> is this sleeping bag from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong> to help you stay warm, and has a water repellent finish on the outside to keep water away from the down. It also has a <strong>big, thick down draft collar</strong>, a zipper tube and a drawcord on the face opening, all to keep you warm at night. Mont Bell also uses a <strong>innovative diagonal cut</strong>, which squeezes around you at night, further adding to your warmth. It <strong>weighs 2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-phantom-sleeping-bag-0-degree-down\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - For winter camping you need a good 4 season sleeping, and with a minimum <strong>temperature rating of 0 degrees</strong> and a weight of just <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>, the Phantom is one of the best. You get the necessary features to stay warm, like a <strong>draft collar and 800+ fill down</strong>, and a few extras too, like the <strong>alpine mummy cut</strong>, which eliminates as much dead space within the sleeping bag as possible without sacrificing comfort. If you want warm and lightweight, this is an excellent option.</li>

People often get in to a lot of trouble when they lose mobility in their fingers. Simple things like tying shoelaces, or more critically, setting up a tent to warm up inside become difficult if not impossible with numb fingers. Even a basic pair of <strong>camping gloves</strong> can go a long ways towards preventing this, and will keep your fingers warm even when things are critical.
<h2>Camping Gloves</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for camping gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Windstopper</strong> – A material that is often included in the construction of camping gloves and similar gloves is something called windstopper, which does what its name suggests, stops wind chill from reaching your hands. It’s a very useful feature to have on a pair of gloves when you find yourself out in bad weather.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Another useful feature to have in a pair of camping gloves is waterproofing, or at least water <!--more-->resistance. It’s a wet world out there, after all, and while cold hands and wets hands are both not the most fun, hands that are both cold and wet can be a disaster, which is why it’s important to try and prevent one or both.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Gloves</h2>
A few of the very best camping gloves that you have to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/801377/marmot-precip-shell-gloves\">Marmot Precip Shell Gloves</a> - If you would prefer something <strong>waterproof</strong> than the Precip shell gloves may be just right for you. They're made of <strong>nylon, with a waterproof membrane</strong>, and have easy to adjust <strong>gauntlet drawcords</strong> to keep your hands warm and to work with layers. They're also<strong> unisex</strong>, so you don't have to worry about a men's or women's version.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-mens\">Outdoor Research Gripper Gloves</a> - If you're a fan of <strong>fleece gloves</strong> there aren't many better choices than these. The fleece keeps your hands warm, while the <strong>Gore Windstopper</strong> liner keeps the windchill from taking all that body heat away. <strong>Reinforced pads on the hands</strong> will keep you from doing any damage to them, and while they're not waterproof, fleece does a good job of shedding small amounts of moisture. There's also a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-gripper-glove-womens\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/layeron-gloves\">Outdoor Designs Layeron Gloves</a> - At the <strong>lightweight and thin</strong> end of the spectrum are the Layeron gloves. They work ideally as either <strong>a liner or a mild weather glove</strong>. They're fairly minimalist, and wont keep your hands protected from any significant rain or wind, but they will dry quickly keep the chill off when it's just a bit too cold to go gloveless.</li>

Temperatures are often low even in the day in these regions, and even in the warmer months it can be bitterly cold, necessitating the kind of sleeping bag that might only be used on the coldest days of the year in warmer climates. Investing in a good arctic sleeping bag for such conditions is critical, because the last thing you want to have to do is shiver through an arctic night, rather than sleep through it.
<h2>Arctic Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for arctic sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Minimum Temperature</strong> – Do your research and find out what the approximate minimum temperature is likely to be in the arctic regions that you will be spending time in. When dealing with such low temperatures the cold can be dangerous, and the last thing you want to do is go to such a region unprepared for the conditions.</li>
	<li><strong>Sleeping Pad</strong> – This isn’t actually a feature of your sleeping bag, but it’s an important thing to mention. Sleeping bags insulate on the principle of loft, but when<!--more--> you’re laying on a sleeping bag all the loft is crushed down. So what you’re sleeping on matters, and a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">winter sleeping pad</a> will reflect a lot of body heat back up at you, whereas a less insulated sleeping pad will let all that heat seep out. Do yourself a favor and invest in a winter sleeping pad.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger</a> - With a minimum <strong>temperature rating of -20</strong> this is an ideal sleeping bag for arctic conditions. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong> and a <strong>water repellent shell</strong>, so that you don't have to worry too much about the down getting wet and losing insulating power. It also has fairly standard cold weather features, like a draft collar, zipper insulation and a drawcord on the hood. It also has <strong>Mont Bell's signature 45 degree cut</strong>, which coils around you for added warmth. It <strong>weighs 3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-puma-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-25-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Puma Gore WS</a> - Another arctic sleeping bag with a slightly lower <strong>temperature rating of -25</strong>. This is another sleeping bag with a <strong>water repellent outer</strong>, and uses the slightly higher quality <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, for extra warmth without extra weight.

And while Gore Tex definitely gives you more waterproofing than it does breathability, Gore Tex wont make your feet sweat quite like some other waterproof materials will. It does breath a little. One of the big advantages of <strong>Gore Tex hiking shoes</strong>, however, is that it is a relatively lightweight method of waterproofing. And when it comes to hiking shoes, lightweight is always better.
<h2>Gore Tex Hiking Shoes</h2>
Things it's good to find on Gore Tex hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Gore Tex</strong> – It seems obvious, but Gore Tex is not the only method that manufacturers use to make hiking shoes waterproof, and just because a hiking shoe is advertised as waterproof, does not mean it uses Gore Tex. Typically Gore Tex is higher quality than other waterproofing methods, so make sure you get Gore Tex, and not some other waterproofing method.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – Just because you’re getting waterproof hiking shoes, doesn’t mean they have to be<!--more--> big, heavy weights on your feet. Remember that the main advantage that shoes have over boots is that they’re smaller and lighter. So don’t give up that advantage just to get a waterproof pair of hiking shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gore Tex Hiking Shoes</h2>
Some of the better Gore Tex hiking shoes, for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Gore Tex Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818510/salomon-xa-pro-3d-ultra-2-gtx-trail-running-shoes-mens\">Salomon XA Pro 3D Ultra 2 GTX</a> - First up a very solid pair of hiking shoes from Salomon with a <strong>Gore Tex XCR liner</strong>. They have Salomon's trademark <strong>single pull lacing system</strong>, and a breathable outer material to help the Gore Tex do its job. They're also relatively lightweight, at just <strong>1 pound 12.4 ounces, or 810 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-footwear-drifter-gtx-hiking-shoe-mens\">Patagonia Footwear Drifter GTX</a> - Another pair of Gore Tex lined hiking shoes, but this pair with a more traditional design. The <strong>outer is all leather</strong>, which both looks good and helps to protect the boots, and the Gore Tex liner, from the use and abuse that the outside of hiking shoes so often experience. The <strong>sole is made by Vibram</strong>, another bonus, though at <strong>2 pounds 1 ounce, or 935 grams</strong>, these aren't the lightest Gore Tex hiking shoes out there.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Gore Tex Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/763943/merrell-siren-sport-gore-tex-xcr-cross-training-shoes-womens\">Merrell Siren Sport Gore-Tex XCR</a> - First up a good, solid pair of hiking shoes from Merrell. The Gore Tex liner, which is of the <strong>breathable, XCR</strong> variety, is joined by a combination of breathable synthetic and leather outer material. The leather is good because it helps to protect the shoe, and the Gore Tex liner, from the abuse that hiking shoes inevitably suffer. The <strong>sole is made by Vibram</strong>, which is always a good sign, and they weigh a very respectable <strong>1 pound 5 ounces, or 590 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-shoe-womens\">The North Face Hedgehog GTX XCR</a> - Another pair of hiking shoes that uses a combination of leather and synthetic material for the outer, as well as a <strong>XCR Gore Tex liner</strong> to keep water out while remaining breathable. They even have <strong>Vibram soles</strong>, just the like the Sirens above. These are slightly heavier, however, at <strong>1 pound 9 ounces, which is 714 grams</strong>.</li>

But there are a couple of different ways to enjoy a race in the snow, and one of the more popular ways is with a pair of snowshoes. For such a race, however, you will need a good pair of <strong>racing snowshoes</strong>. And if you expect to win your race, or at least be competitive, you will want racing snowshoes of a certain variety.
<h2>Racing Snowshoes</h2>
Things that you want to look for when buying racing snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – First and foremost, you need to worry about the weight of your snowshoes if you plan to race in them. You wouldn’t wear a big, heavy pair of boots to race in, and so it’s not a good to pick up a big, heavy pair of snowshoes for a race. They’ll only slow you down and sap your energy while everyone else sails past.</li>
	<li><strong>Crampons</strong> – Depending on what kind of race you’re engaging in, you will want more or less crampons. Back country races, where<!--more--> you would be navigating between checkpoints, for instance, would require a good back country snowshoe with ample crampons, whereas racing along an established trail will require much less robust crampons.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Racing Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the better options for snowshoes to take racing.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805232/atlas-run-snowshoes\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - First up, a great pair of running and racing snowshoes from Atlas. They're a standard combination of <strong>aluminum frame and nylon deck</strong>, though they have a minimal amount of crampons to help save on weight. Atlas also uses a spring loaded suspension system to help you along and create a more natural stride. They will <strong>support up to 220 pounds</strong> on a trail, and <strong>weigh 2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.21 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/vo2-racing-snowshoe\">Easton Race Snowshoes</a> - These are another excellent pair of racing snowshoes, this time from Easton. They use a <strong>higher quality of aluminum for the frame, to save on weight, and a kind of carbon fiber for the decking</strong> material. Like the Atlas Runs above they have just a toe and heel crampon, to help save on weight. And at just <strong>2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, they are noticeably lighter, though they are only recommended for weights up to 180 pounds.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-race-snowshoe\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - These are very similar in design to the Atlas Runs up above, with little in the way of design differences. The one big difference is that these are lighter. At just <strong>2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong>, these are the lightest racing snowshoes on this list. They pull this off by using the same, <strong>improved aluminum for the frame</strong> that's found on the Easton snowshoes above, and a material called Nytex for the deck. They also have a slightly smaller maximum weight than the Atlas Runs, at 190 pounds, but <strong>if you want the best running and racing snowshoes you can find, these are them</strong>.</li>

Even seemingly pristine water sources may be brimming with all kinds of stuff that will make you sick or worse. So if you really want to enjoy your backpacking experience, and not have it cut short by sickness, invest in a good water filter for backpacking.
<h2>Water Filters for Backpacking</h2>
Features to be aware of when shopping for water filters to take backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> – When it comes to water filters for backpacking it helps if the filter is lightweight, and also relatively small, to cut down on bulk. Experienced backpackers should be well aware of the fact that you have to carry everything you bring, and every ounce matters. Do yourself a favour and invest in a lightweight water filter to take backpacking.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter Lifetime</strong> – Most all filters will need to be replaced eventually, but some will last longer than others. Many will last for 1000 liters <!--more-->or more, but some less, and if you use your filter quite a bit you may find yourself needing to replace that little thing more than you would otherwise like.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Filters for Backpacking</h2>
Some of the better water filters to take backpacking with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695265/msr-miniworks-ex-water-filter\">MSR MiniWorks EX Water Filter</a> - The MiniWorks is a fantastic little <strong>pump water filter</strong> that many backpackers use. The bottom will fit securely on to a MSR Dromedary or a Nalgene bottle, and will also work with just about any other water bottle out there. It pumps out <strong>.83 liters per minute</strong>, and will go for <strong>2000 liters before you need to replace anything</strong>. It <strong>weighs 14.6 ounces, or 416 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-gravityworks-filter-and-purifier-system\">Platypus GravityWorks Filter</a> - If you'd prefer not to do all that pumping, the GravityWorks is a fantastic choice for backpackers. It uses two bags, one for the dirty water and one for the clean. You hang the dirty water above the empty bag, and <strong>gravity forces the water through</strong> the hose that connects the two, and the filter, which is inline on the hose. It filters an impressive <strong>1.75 liters per minute, and goes for 1501 liters before you need to replace</strong> anything. The whole system weighs just <strong>10.7 ounces, or 305 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hiker-pro-microfilter\">Katadyn Hiker PRO Microfilter</a> - Another <strong>pump water filter</strong>, this time from Katadyn. The Hiker PRO is a popular choice with backpackers. It will put out roughly <strong>1 liter per minute</strong>, and will go for about <strong>750 liters before you need to replace</strong> the filter. Part of what makes it popular with backpackers is that it has a respectable weight of just <strong>11 ounces, or 310 grams</strong>.</li>

Both synthetic insulation and down, but down especially, loses insulating power when you get it wet. So if you’re unlucky enough to get your sleeping bag wet, you will be both wet and cold, which is never a good combination. <strong>Waterproof sleeping bags</strong>, however, help to solve this problem by protecting the down or synthetic insulation in your sleeping bag from the moisture in the outside world.
<h2>Waterproof Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for waterproof sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof or Water Repellent</strong> – Often sleeping bags are only water repellent, meaning that they will be protected from small amounts of water, but not large amounts. Usually this is all you need. But if you really do need a waterproof sleeping bag, you will likely want one with a Gore Tex shell.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – In theory, if your sleeping bag is waterproof and the insulation inside wont be getting wet, then the<!--more--> insulation you use doesn’t matter too much. But it rarely works out that well in the real world. Just remember that down performs much worse than synthetic insulation when it gets wet, so if you see wet insulation in your future, you might want synthetic insulation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Sleeping Bags</h2>
A few of the better waterproof sleeping bags to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma 30+</a> - Just because a sleeping bag is intended for warm temperatures, doesn't mean it cant be compromised by water. The Plasma only has a minimum <strong>temperature rating of 30 degrees</strong>, but its exterior is with a water repellent product, to keep the <strong>900+ fill down</strong> inside dry. It also <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, so you know it's a high quality sleeping bag. And at just <strong>1 pound 7 ounces, or 670 grams</strong>, it's also one of the lightest sleeping bags at the 30 degree temperature rating.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - This sleeping bag from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell has a minimum <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, and has a DWR, or water repellent finish, to keep water out of the <strong>800+ fill down</strong> inside. But aside the from the water resistance, this is another excellent sleeping bag. <strong>Mont Bell uses a unique construction technique where everything is cut on a 45 degree angle</strong>, so that the sleeping bag coils and squeezes around you as you move, keeping you warm at night. It's also very lightweight, at just <strong>2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-puma-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-25-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Puma Gore WS</a> - With a <strong>temperature rating of -25</strong>, this is the kind of sleeping bag that you want to take with you for true winter weather. It also uses <strong>Gore Windstopper for the shell</strong>, which is water resistant, and equally as important, wind resistant. It's filled with <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is a great quality, and has plenty of other features to keep you warm, like a draft collar and zipper tube. It also weighs a very slim <strong>3 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.64 kilograms</strong>.</li>

And one of the more important items in a collection of winter camping gear is a <strong>winter camping tent</strong>. Winter weather conditions can be quite a bit different from those experienced in summer, after all, and winter camping tents have what it takes to survive those conditions and keep you warm and cozy at night while the weather rages outside.
<h2>Winter Camping Tents</h2>
Features to try and find when shopping for winter camping tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Poles</strong> – Winter tents often have more poles than tents intended for use in the other three seasons of the year. This helps to add strength to the structure of the tent, so that it can better withstand high speed winds, which are a common feature of winter weather. Related to <!--more-->this, winter camping tents often have low, sloping sides, which shed wind, rather than catching it.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall</strong> – Many winter camping tents have a single wall design. There are a couple of reasons for this, but one of the big advantages is that single wall tents tend to weigh less than a traditional tent with an inner tent and fly. Just be sure that any single wall tent you get has plenty of ventilation, so that moisture can escape at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Winter Camping Tents</h2>
A few of the very best winter camping tents available.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-fitzroy-tent-3-person-4-season\">Black Diamond Fitzroy Tent</a> - First up, a <strong>high quality winter camping tent</strong> from Black Diamond. If you want bomb proof, this is as close as you will get in a tent. There is<strong> enough room for 3 to squeeze in, or else for 2 to sleep with plenty of elbow room</strong>. It's a <strong>single wall design</strong>, and has plenty of ventilation, as well as two doors, to make sure you don't get damp inside. <strong>4 poles, which intersect a total of 7 times</strong> are what really makes this tent a winter camping tent, however. The whole thing <strong>weighs 6 pounds 5 ounces, which is 2.86 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/twin-sisters-shelter-2-person\">MSR Twin Sisters Shelter</a> - The Twin Sisters is something a little more unusual. It's <strong>not actually a tent, it's a tarp, meaning that it has no floor</strong>. There are a couple of big advantages to this design, one being that <strong>you can use trekking poles or ski poles as the tent supports</strong>, and leave the tent poles at home. Being a tarp it also weighs a very impressive <strong>2 pound 3 ounces, which is 1.1 kilograms</strong>, making it far lighter than other other winter camping tent out there. There's <strong>room for 2 inside</strong>, and 2 doors and plenty of ventilation mean that you don't have to worry about being damp in the morning.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/739354/rei-mountain-2-tent\">REI Mountain 2 Tent</a> - If you're not looking to scale mountains any time soon, and just want something that will stand up to a little snow and wind, then the Mountain 2 from REI is a good choice. It's a <strong>two wall design, and comes with 5 poles, for plenty of strength</strong>. It has two doors, though with the double wall design you wont have to worry as much about ventilation. It <strong>weighs 8 pounds, or 3.63 kilograms, and fits two</strong>, but also comes in a <strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/739349/rei-mountain-3-tent\">3 man version</a></strong>.</li>

But wet, cold hands can be a risky situation to be in as well. When your fingers become stiff it can be difficult to do even simple things, like tie shoelaces or operate zippers. Fortunately it’s easy to keep your hands warm and dry, and the <strong>best hiking gloves</strong> do a great job of just that.
<h2>Best Hiking Gloves</h2>
What to be on the lookout for when shopping for hiking gloves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – When you’re hiking it’s not critical to have waterproof gloves, but you should at least have water resistant gloves. That way, your hands and aren’t going to get wet with the first few drops of rain, but will hold out a little longer than that.</li>
	<li><strong>Wind Proof</strong> – Almost as important as being water resistant is being wind proof, or at least wind resistant. Wind chill can<!--more--> drop the temperature inside your gloves quickly, and having a good pair of hiking gloves that will protect that precious body heat is a definite bonus.</li>

Cold feet, after all, is never fun, and can even be dangerous if you prolong that exposure, or if you mix it with wet feet. One thing to remember when getting thick hiking socks, however, is that you need to fit those socks inside your boot or shoe. Which is why it’s often a good idea to get boots or shoes that are maybe one half size too big.
<h2>Thick Hiking Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're buying thick hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – No matter what thickness of hiking sock you’re buying, you have to make a decision on what kind of sock you want to get. There are a few different options available, but the best for hiking is always going to be wool. It keeps your feet warm, breathes well and is a natural anti-microbial. You can ask for much more than that in a sock.</li>
	<li><strong>Fitted</strong> – A simple tube sock is more prone to rolling and creasing, which in turn leads to blisters, hot spots and all kinds of other foot problems. This is more likely to happen with thin hiking socks than it is with thick<!--more--> hiking socks, but it’s still something to consider.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thick Hiking Socks</h2>
Some of the best thick hiking socks for cold temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bridgedale-endurance-summit-sock-mens\">Bridgedale Endurance Summit Socks</a> - These are a solid pair of thick hiking socks from Bridgedale. They're a <strong>blend of wool, nylon and a few other materials</strong>. The end product is a thick, <strong>fitted sock</strong> that will keep your feet <strong>warm all the way down to -25</strong>, according to Bridgedale's testing. A good choice for cold weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/604590/smartwool-expedition-trekking-socks\">SmartWool Expedition Trekking Socks</a> - If you've ever bought hiking socks before you should be well aware that SmartWool makes some excellent products in this category. These particular socks are a <strong>blend of wool, nylon and spandex for a stretchy, fitted sock</strong> that will keep your feet warm. Features like a high density insole and instep to keep your feet protected from abrasion are what separate SmartWool socks from the competition.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/wick-dry-explorer-socks\">Fox River Wick Dry Explorer Socks</a> - One more thick hiking sock, this one <strong>made mostly of acrylic, with a bit of wool and nylon added</strong>. These are more a budget pair of thick hiking socks, though they will do the crucial job of keeping your feet warm.

Your head is one of those areas of your body that loses a lot of body heat. So if you want to stay warm, it’s a good idea to put something over your head, to keep all that escaping body heat contained. A <strong>hooded fleece jacket</strong> will do just that. And then when you’re hot and you want to cool down, you can drop the hood, and all that body heat is allowed to escape, which helps to cool you down quite a bit.
<h2>Hooded Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing hooded fleece jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – One of the more important variables when it comes to fleece jackets of any kind is the thickness of the fleece. The thicker the fleece is, the warmer you will be, and the less the fleece will breath. Similarly, the thicker the fleece of the hood is, the more body heat coming off of your head will be trapped and reflected.</li>
	<li><strong>Density</strong> – Another property of fleece to pay attention to is the density of the fleece. There are some very <!--more-->fluffy fleece jackets out there that might remind you of carpet, and then some other fleeces that are quite dense and compact, which do a good job of deflecting wind, for instance.</li>
</ul>

<h3><strong>Women's Hooded Fleece Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-shadow-hooded-fleece-jacket-womens\">Rab Shadow Hooded Fleece Jacket</a> - The Shadow uses a <strong>thinner fleece, but one that has a hardened surface, which makes it ideal for windy conditions</strong>.

Backcountry travel really is one of the more enjoyable things you can do on snowshoes, however. Trails can be fun, but a wide open expanse of untouched snow is a tantalizing treat, and <strong>backpacking snowshoes</strong> are a great way to explore that.
<h2>Backcountry Snowshoes</h2>
What you want to see on a pair of backcountry snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Crampons</strong> – First and foremost, you need snowshoes that have a good amount of crampons if you intend to go in to the backcountry. Steep terrain, rolling terrain, uneven terrain, you have to expect that at certain points you’re not going to be able to get much a grip with your snowshoes, and you better hope that what grip you do manage to get holds.</li>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – If you’re doing any backcountry travel with snowshoes, you’re probably taking a backpack along with you. And depending on how <!--more-->heavy your backpack is, there’s a chance that you‘re exceeding the maximum recommended weight of your snowshoes. So getting snowshoes with a high enough maximum weight is a good idea, as is getting snowshoes with optional tails, to increase the maximum weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backcountry Snowshoes</h2>
Some of the better pairs of backcountry snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805328/msr-evo-ascent-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo Ascent 22 Snowshoes</a> - These are a great pair of snowshoes for backcountry travel. They include a <strong>heel lift bar</strong>, to help with leg fatigue, and two long crampon rails, in addition to the toe and heel crampons, to aid with traction. They're only 22 inches long, and as a result will <strong>only hold 180 pounds</strong>, but with the <strong><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a> that goes up to 250 pounds</strong>. These are also plastic, which means they're comparatively lightweight, at just <strong>4 pounds 1 ounce, or 1.84 kilograms</strong>, and also comparatively cheap.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - The Lightning Ascents are another excellent backcountry snowshoe. They use what MSR calls the <strong>360 degree traction system</strong>, which is crampons around the entire outer frame of the snowshoe, in addition to the standard heel and toe crampons. These <strong>come in three different lengths</strong>, the largest of which <strong>will hold 280 pounds</strong>, and there are also <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">optional tails</a> that will add even more weight capacity to that, which makes them perfect for carrying a heavy backpack. The medium size weighs <strong>3 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.78 kilograms</strong>, and there's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/12-series-snowshoes\">Atlas 12 Series Snowshoes</a> - One more pair of backcountry snowshoes, this time from Atlas. These have a fairly standard aluminum frame and nylon deck design, though the <strong>frame is the high quality 7075 aluminum</strong>, and the deck is a proprietary material called Duratek. Standard backcountry snowshoe features like a <strong>heel lift bar</strong> are included. These come in <strong>three different lengths, the largest of which will hold 300+ pounds</strong>. The medium size weighs <strong>4 pounds 7 ounces, or 2.02 kilograms</strong>, and there's also a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/elektra-12-series-snowshoes\">women's version</a>.</li>

Or you may find a lot of water travelling down your leg and soaking your socks and feet. Whatever the case, <strong>gaiters for hiking</strong> are a wonderful addition to your gear collection. They prevent water and debris from entering your boots, and the better gaiters will do this without making your feet feel hot and stuffy in the process.
<h2>Gaiters for Hiking</h2>
What to consider when buying gaiters for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Depending on what you plan to use the gaiters for, you may or may not want them to be waterproof. If you just want to keep debris out of your shoes or boots then waterproofing is probably not much of a concern. A good compromise is water resistant gaiters, which will keep small amounts of water out but also breath well</li>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – Another important thing to consider when shopping for hiking gaiters is the height of the<!--more--> gaiters. Sizes range from ankle gaiters, which reach the top of the ankle, to full mountaineering gaiters that go all the way up to the bottom of the knee. And plenty of choices in between those two extremes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gaiters for Hiking</h2>
A few of the very best gaiters for hiking in.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - If you're looking for a great all-around gaiter, then the Crocodile is a good choice. It's b<strong>een around forever, in fact it won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award way back in 1999</strong>, the reason being it's such a popular choice. The <strong>upper section is a tough, waterproof Gore Tex</strong>, and the lower is even tougher cordura nylon. They reach the mid-calf, and will fit a mountaineering boot as easily as something smaller and lighter. A good, and very popular pair of gaiters for hiking. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - If you want waterproof, but something lighter and less hardcore, then the Hispar Gaiters are a fantastic choice. They use<strong> eVent for the upper, which is a fabric similar to Gore Tex, but generally more breathable and lighter</strong>. The bottom portion is a very tough polyester, but not quite as tough as the bottom section of the Crocodiles above. These are a great choice for anything from a little light mountaineering to just a casual hike in wet conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778003/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-low-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Rock Mountain Low Gaiters</a> - <strong>If you'd prefer an ankle gaiter</strong> then these are one of the better pairs, from Outdoor Research. They're made from <strong>nylon coated with a durable water resistant finish</strong>, so they will keep a little water out, but not a whole bunch. On the other hand they will breath much better than a waterproof pair of gaiters. So an ideal choice for hiking when water is a concern, or when you just want to keep dust and rocks out of your shoes.</li>

But down itself is a great choice, and has a lot of benefits that you don’t get with other insulating materials like fleece or wool. For one, it has a better warmth to weight ratio than just about any other insulating material. Down also compresses very well, and if you’re stuffing that down jacket in to a backpack, for instance, the ability to get it in to a nice small package and not take up much room can be a real benefit.
<h2>Down Jackets for Men</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for down jackets for men.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – The one drawback of a down jacket is that you’re not supposed to get the down wet. That’s why a water resistant down jacket, if not a waterproof down jacket, is always a good idea. If you keep the down dry then the down, in turn will keep you warm, even when it drizzles a little bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Another important feature to look at when buying a down jacket is the quality, or the fill number. A <!--more-->down jacket with a higher fill number, like 900+ fill, means that the down lofts more, and provides more warmth, relative to its weight. It also means that the down will compress down better.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Down Jackets for Men</h2>
Some of the better down jackets for men to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ex-light-down-jacket-men-s\">Mont Bell EX Light Down Jacket</a> - <strong>If your main concern is weight</strong>, and if you want something that will pack down as small as possible in your backpack, then the EX Light is your best choice. It <strong>uses high quality 900+ fill down</strong> for insulation, and has a <strong>DWR treatment that makes it water resistant</strong>. But beyond that this jacket is lacking in features, in fact it doesn't even have pockets. What it does have is a very impressive <strong>weight of just 5.6 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>, which is better than just about everything else out there.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> - If you want something lightweight that will go well with backpacking, camping and hiking, but you do at least want a few extras, like pockets, then this jacket from Patagonia might be a better choice. It <strong>uses 800+ fill down</strong>, and comes with <strong>two hand pockets, as well as a chest pocket and even a hood</strong>. It's also <strong>water resistant, but at 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong> it's significantly heavier than the Mont Bell EX Light above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/canada-goose-chilliwack-down-parka-mens\">Canada Goose Chilliwack Bomber Down Parka</a> - If you're more looking for something for around town, and maybe a few outings in colder temperatures, the Chilliwack from Canada Goose is a great choice. Despite the company name this jacket is actually stuffed with <strong>duck down</strong>, and plenty of it, because the object with this jacket is to keep you warm. And <strong>features like a fur lined hood</strong> do just that. It's also <strong>water resistant</strong>. A great choice if you want something for around town.</li>

The <strong>best gaiters</strong> can do quite a lot for you, such as keep your feet dry, and keep debris from clogging up your boots or shoes, and without trapping all the hot air and moisture that is trying to escape. Of course there are a few different options available when it comes to gaiters, and you have a few choices to make before you buy.
<h2>Best Gaiters</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – First and foremost, you need to decide if you want ankle gaiters, gaiters that reach all the way up to the bottom of the knee, or something in between. Ankle gaiters are good for three season hiking, but you may want the taller ones for something like trekking through fields of powdery snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproofing</strong> – There are plenty of gaiters that are waterproof, and plenty that aren’t. Waterproof gaiters <!--more-->are great, but the trade off is that waterproof gaiters wont breath as well as a pair of gaiters that are just water resistant. So if you need waterproof get them, but otherwise you’ll likely be happier with a water resistant option.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gaiters Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the better gaiters for a variety of uses.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-mens\">Outdoor Research Crocodiles Gaiters</a> - Having won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award way back in 1999</strong>, these gaiters have remained a favorite with hikers, backpackers and many others, for the simple reason that they're an excellent pair of gaiters. They use <strong>very durable Gore Tex for the upper section, and even more durable cordura nylon for the bottom</strong>. A great pair of gaiters to use for anything from mountaineering to a little light hiking in the rain. They also come in a <strong><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-crocodiles-gaiter-womens\">women's version</a></strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - If you want a mid-calf gaiter, but don't want something quite as heavy duty as the Crocodiles, then the Hispars are a great choice. They use <strong>eVent instead of Gore Tex for the upper section</strong>, eVent being waterproof, but a lot more breathable than Gore Tex. The <strong>bottom section is a lighter nylon</strong>, and the price is also considerably less than the Crocodiles. A <strong>very good gaiter for general hiking and outdoor adventures</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803452/rei-desert-gaiters\">REI Desert Gaiters</a> - If you're just interested in something that <strong>will keep debris, and maybe the odd rain shower out of your shoes</strong>, then an ankle length gaiter like the Desert Gaiters from REI are an ideal choice. They're <strong>designed to fit trail running shoes and similarly sized shoes and boots</strong>. They're also nylon, with <strong>no waterproofing or water resistance</strong> to speak of, but with a <strong>UPF rating of 30+</strong>. So they wont keep rain out, but they're also very breathable, and a good choice for warm weather.</li>

Down has one of the best weight to warmth ratios of any insulating material out there. But there are still lightweight and heavy down jackets. Fortunately for the hikers, campers, backpackers and others concerned about weight, there is a fantastic <strong>lightweight down jacket</strong> just right for you. But there are a couple things to look for to make sure you get the best lightweight down jacket possible.
<h2>Lightweight Down Jacket</h2>
Features to look for when shopping for a lightweight down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – When it comes to the weight of a down jacket this is the number you need to pay attention to. All other things being equal, a jacket filled with 900+ fill down, which is the high quality stuff, will be lighter than a jacket filled with 700+ fill down. The higher the down quality is, the better the weight to warmth ratio is.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – A hood is always a nice thing to have, but part of the reason you get a hood on a jacket is for when it rains, and you shouldn’t be getting a down<!--more--> jacket all that wet, so a hood isn’t as crucial. And if you get a down jacket without a hood, you of course save the weight that the hood would have cost you.</li>
</ul>

The best <strong>hiking pants for women</strong> or men will be usable in just about any month of the year. You might have to layer something under them in the winter to stay warm, and it might be good if they came with a few ventilation options for the summer heat, but the best hiking pants really will do it all. But if you want that versatile pair of hiking pants, you need to know what to look for when you’re doing your reviewing.
<h2>Hiking Pants for Women</h2>
What you want to see from hiking pants for women.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Convertible</strong> – One of the most usable features on a pair of hiking pants is the ability to convert the pants from pants in to shorts. Convertible pants, if you’ve never come across them, have a zipper around either leg, at about the knee, that allows you to zip off the bottom section of pants and throw them in your bag when things get hot, leaving you wearing a pair of shorts instead.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabric</strong> – There are a few different fabric choices when it comes to hiking pants, but nylon is definitely the<!--more--> best. It dries quickly, which is as good for when you’re sweating and crossing rivers as it is when it’s raining and you’re cold. Nylon also weighs very little, and doesn’t rip easily, which is always nice to have on a hike.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Pants for Women</h2>
Some of the better choices when it comes to hiking pants for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/809935/exofficio-nomad-roll-up-pants-womens\">ExOfficio Nomad Roll-Up Pants</a> - First up, a very good pair of women's hiking pants from a company that makes great outdoor clothing, ExOfficio. These aren't convertible, but they do <strong>roll up, so that you have the option of a full length pant or a capri length pant</strong>, without having to worry about having to put the bottom section of your convertible pants anywhere. They're <strong>made with nylon, so they will dry quickly, and have a UPF 30+ rating</strong> for the sun.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-horizon-tempest-pant-womens\">The North Face Horizon Tempest Pants</a> - Another excellent hiking pant from The North Face that also <strong>rolls up</strong>, just the Nomad pants above, rather than having the bottom section come off. In terms of design these are fairly similar to the Nomad pants above, but have a simple rope belt integrated, rather than the belt loops on the Nomads. These also have a <strong>very high UPF rating of 50+</strong>, so you don't have to ever worry about the sun.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ramesa-convertible-pant-women-s\">Mountain Hardwear Ramesa Convertible Pants</a> - One more pair of hiking pants for women, these ones being <strong>fully convertible</strong>. They're made from something called Canyon Twill, which is likely a kind of nylon. They also have a <strong>water repellent finish</strong>, so you don't have to worry too much about them getting wet. That, plus a <strong>UPF rating of 50+</strong> means that you're covered for just about anything that nature throws at you.</li>

But the <strong>best backpacking pillow</strong> wont take up much room in your backpack or add much bulk to your backpack. In fact, there are some backpacking pillows which are downright small and lightweight, and which you’ll hardly even notice you’re carrying. There are also a few more innovative options for giving you somewhere to rest your head.
<h2>Best Backpacking Pillow</h2>
Things to look for from a backpacking pillow.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Padding Method</strong> – You might think that with a backpacking pillow you have to have a foam pillow, but just like with sleeping pads, there’s more than one way to keep you comfortable at night. In fact, there are many excellent inflatable sleeping pads that do an excellent job of keeping you comfortable at night.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Related to the above, the weight of your pillow is something important to look at. A pillow<!--more--> can get heavy surprisingly quickly, and you don’t want a big, heavy pillow. You also don’t want a big, bulky pillow that will take up a lot of room in your backpack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Backpacking Pillow Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the very best backpacking pillows.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-down-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Down Pillow</a> - The Down Pillow from Therm-A-Rest is a great product that fills a certain role. On its own it's not the greatest pillow because it doesn't hold its loft all that well. But when paired with a sweater, for example, it does a great job of padding your head, while the sweater provides the bulk. It also <strong>has a built in compression system</strong>, so you can get it down nice and small for packing in the morning. And it <strong>uses 650+ fill down</strong>. So a great product, if used in conjunction with some other bulky item. It also comes in <strong>three different sizes</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/719843/therm-a-rest-compressible-pillow\">Therm-A-Rest Compressible Pillow</a> - If nothing but a foam pillow will do, Therm-A-Rest has you covered there too. <strong>This foam pillow compresses in to its own pillow case</strong>, so it's easy to store. It also comes in <strong>three different sizes</strong>, so you can have small or large, depending on what your needs are. The <strong>medium weighs 9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>, so not the lightest product ever, but you cant put a price, or weight, on comfort.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-comfort-system-pillow\">Mont Bell U.L. Comfort System Pillow</a> - If you're more concerned about weight than anything else, Mont Bell's inflatable pillow is an excellent choice. It <strong>weighs practically nothing, at just 2.3 ounces, or 65 grams</strong>. And while it's just a basic square pillow, it gets great reviews, and is actually quite comfortable. And of course <strong>being inflatable, it packs down to practically nothing</strong>. So a solid choice for a backpacking pillow if you're looking to save on weight and bulk.</li>

A straight waterproof jacket is definitely a good choice. In fact the <strong>best rain jacket for hiking</strong> is likely a Gore Tex jacket, or a similar material, like eVent. But there are certainly other options available to you. If you don’t expect too much rain, for instance, there are some very water repellent soft shell jackets that make an attractive choice as an all around good jacket to take hiking.
<h2>Best Rain Jacket for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a rain jacket for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Venting</strong> – Whenever you have a waterproof jacket you need to make sure that there is some sort of ventilation available, so that you don’t get sweaty, and wet from the inside out. Rain jackets often do a great job of keeping water out, and also keeping water in.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a lot of different materials that you will find rain jackets coming in, some more waterproof<!--more--> than others. If you are fine with a water resistant jacket there’s nothing wrong with getting that, but know the limitations of the fabric you are buying before you get on to the hiking trail and find out the hard way.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rain Jacket for Hiking Reviews</h2>
Some of the very best rain jackets to take hiking, for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803360/arcteryx-theta-ar-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Theta AR Jacket</a> - First up, a jacket from Arc'teryx, a company that has a well deserved reputation of making some quality rain jackets. This particular one uses the <strong>good Gore Tex, called 3L Pro</strong>, which will keep you dry all day long. It also includes the standard features, like a <strong>helmet compatible hood and pit zips under each arm</strong>. But more exotic details, like a <strong>few inches of extra length</strong>, an inner fabric that works well with layers and a <strong>minimal amount of seams</strong> show the detail that Arc'teryx puts in to their work. This is an expensive rain jacket for hiking, but definitely one of the best. And there's a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803344/arcteryx-theta-ar-jacket-womens\">women's version</a> too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-mens-mar1046\">Marmot Minimalist</a> - If you're not looking for something with all the features, the Marmot Minimalist is a good compromise. It uses <strong>Paclite Gore Tex</strong>, which is the most breathable fabric that Gore Tex makes. It also has <strong>pit zips, two hand pockets and a zippered chest pocket</strong>, but beyond that it doesn't have much, which is the point, given that the jacket is called Minimalist. There's also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">women's version</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - For hikers that carry a lot of backpacks, the Super Mica might be just right. It uses <strong>Marmot's proprietary waterproof  / breathable fabric, called MemBrain</strong>, which is thin and lightweight, which means the Super Mica will fold up nicely for stuffing in to a backpack. It also has <strong>raised hand pockets, which are fully accessible when you're wearing a backpack hip belt</strong>. And finally, the <strong>shoulders and waist are both reinforced</strong>, so backpack straps don't do any damage to the waterproof exterior of the jacket. One of the best rain jackets for hiking designed with a backpack in mind.</li>

Soft shell jackets often make ideal <strong>hiking jackets for women</strong> and men, for example. They are often water resistant, and also breathable, which is a great combination to have for hiking in. Many also come with a hood, which gives you the ability to trap all that body heat that escapes from the head, and make yourself a lot warmer as a result.
<h2>Hiking Jackets for Women</h2>
Things you want to look at when shopping for hiking jackets for women.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – As alluded to above, there are a couple of different material choices when it comes to picking out a hiking jacket. A soft shell material is great, for instance, but you might prefer something like fleece, or even wool, both of which breath well and are naturally water resistant.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Depending on the kinds of conditions that you find yourself needing a hiking <!--more-->jacket for, you may or may not want a waterproof hiking jacket. If you do elect to get a waterproof jacket, just be sure to get a jacket that also has good ventilation, so you don’t end up getting wet from sweat.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Jackets for Women</h2>
A few of the very best hiking jackets for women on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803345/arcteryx-beta-ar-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Beta AR Jacket</a> - If you want the best in jackets, Arc'teryx is a good brand to go to. This particular jacket uses the <strong>high end Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric</strong>, which is what you want to be wearing when it really starts pouring rain. This <strong>jacket is hip length</strong>, to give you a bit of extra protection from the rain. <strong>Pit zips keep you ventilated, and little touches, like a as few seams as possible</strong>, so that there are fewer places for water to get in, make this a very desirable hiking jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">Marmot Minimalist Jacket</a> - If you want a quality Gore Tex jacket, but don't want to spend a whole lot, then the Minimalist is a good compromise. It uses <strong>Gore Tex's 2.5 layer fabric, called Paclite</strong>, and while it has all the standard features, like hand pockets and pit zips, this jacket lives up to its name by having a minimal amount of extras. It's a <strong>simple jacket that does the job of keeping you dry</strong>. The Paclite fabric will also pack down small, so a good option for stuffing in to a backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-strom-jacket-women-s\">GoLite Tumalo Pertex Storm Jacket</a> - If you really want <strong>lightweight and breathable</strong>, the Tumalo is a good choice. It's a nylon shell, so it will breath extremely well, while keeping you dry. And like the Minimalist, it has just the basics, like pit zips and a couple of zippered hand pockets. But <strong>with GoLite products the focus is always on small and lightweight</strong>, and this is an ideal hiking jacket to put in your backpack and forget about until you need it.</li>

A <strong>waterproof hiking jacket</strong>, for instance, is a great item to have because rain is definitely one weather condition that you always want to be prepared for. Of course not all waterproof hiking jackets are made equal, and there are plenty of things that you want to be looking for when you go shopping for a new waterproof hiking jacket.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Jacket</h2>
A good waterproof hiking jacket should have a few different things going for it.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – One of the most important features of a waterproof jacket that you want to look at is the material used to make the jacket. Some materials are claimed to be waterproof, for example, but after a few hours of steady rain will start to leak through. Know what you’re buying, and what its limitations are.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong> – Another important thing that you definitely want to see on a waterproof hiking jacket is <!--more-->ventilation of some kind. Waterproof jackets are often excellent at keeping water out, but are not so good at letting water, or sweat, out. A jacket that is breathable, and has ventilation, is a definite must to help avert this.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best waterproof hiking jackets, for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - If you spend a lot of time wearing a backpack then there are some excellent jackets, like the Super Mica, that are <strong>built with a backpack in mind</strong>. The <strong>shoulders and the waist of the Super Mica are both reinforced</strong>, so that your backpack straps wont rub your jacket raw. The <strong>hand pockets are also raised, to be accessible while your backpacks hip belt is done up</strong>. And it uses Marmots very lightweight and thin MemBrain fabric for waterproofing, so that you can stuff this waterproof hiking jacket in a backpack and forget about it when you don't need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - The Torrentshell is a great <strong>cheap waterproof hiking jacket</strong>. It uses <strong>Patagonia's H2No fabric for waterproofing</strong>, and has standard features, like pit zips to keep you well ventilated. It uses just two basic zippered hand pockets, and a simple hood. So not terribly feature rich, but the price is definitely right for a waterproof hiking jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754256/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779570/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - At the other end of the price spectrum is the Alpha SV, from Arc'teryx. It uses the <strong>very good Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric</strong>, which will have no problems keeping you dry even in a downpour. With Arc'teryx you pay more, but you also get attention to detail. Features like a <strong>minimal amount of seams, a helmet compatible hood and a few extra inches of length</strong> to extend the jacket over the hips really show the drtail work that Arc'teryx puts in to their jackets. Not cheap, but definitely one of the best waterproof hiking jackets out there.</li>

So <strong>cheap soft shell jackets</strong> are a great idea. But finding a soft shell jacket that is both cheap and of a good enough quality that you wont have to buy another one next year is not easy. But it’s certainly not impossible, either. A sale is an easy way to go about it, but even then, it can help to know what to look for when buying a cheap soft shell jacket.
<h2>Cheap Soft Shell Jackets</h2>
What to consider when looking for cheap soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – Hoods are great things to have for staying warm, but they’re by no means necessary, especially since you wont likely be using a soft shell jacket hood to stay dry in the rain. So if you can get a hat to keep your head warm you can forgo paying the extra money for a soft shell jacket with a hood.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Unlike a hood, water resistance is actually a fairly useful thing to have on a soft shell <!--more-->jacket, because the fall, winter and spring months that most people will be using a soft shell jacket in are typically the months that see the most rain. But if you don’t mind getting a little damp, and are wanting a cheap soft shell jacket, a jacket without any water resistance will lower the price.</li>

If you have no way to get warm and stay warm you’re in serious trouble. So it’s very important to have a good <strong>extreme cold weather sleeping bag</strong> in such a situation, since that will likely be your main way, if not your only way, to get warm. And even more, you need a sleeping bag that you can depend on, that wont fail you when you end up needing it most.
<h2>Extreme Cold Weather Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when looking for an extreme cold weather sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – For extreme cold weather it’s a very good idea to have a water resistant or even waterproof sleeping bag. A wet sleeping bag is not a warm sleeping bag, and a failing sleeping bag can make for a dangerous situation when you find yourself in extreme cold weather.</li>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – It’s important to plan ahead for extreme cold weather, and get a sleeping <!--more-->bag with a temperature rating that can handle it, and keep you warm. You can always throw on a few layers to wear inside your sleeping bag, but it’s more comfortable, and safer, to get a sleeping bag with an appropriate temperature rating.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Extreme Cold Weather Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the very best extreme cold weather sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/mountain-hardwear-phantom-sleeping-bag-0-degree-down\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom Sleeping Bag</a> - First, an excellent 0 degree sleeping bag from Mountain Hardwear. What helps this bag stand out is the <strong>impressive weight of just 2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.19 kilograms</strong>, which makes it one of the lighter sleeping bags with a 0 degree temperature rating. And what helps make this good for extreme conditions is the <strong>narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>, which helps to eliminate as much unused space within the sleeping bag, which keeps you warmer. Besides all that, the Phantom uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger EXP</a> - With a <strong>temperature rating of -20</strong>, this is a sleeping bag well built for extreme cold. It uses <strong>800+ fill down, and uses a DWR, water resistant exterior shell</strong> to keep you and the down inside your sleeping bag dry. Mont Bell also uses an angled baffle design, which coils around you at night as you sleep, which helps to keep you warm. So another excellent extreme cold weather sleeping bag. It weighs <strong>3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>.</li>

The CWM <strong>weighs 4 pounds 10 ounces, or 2.09 kilograms</strong>.</li>

A <strong>15 degree sleeping bag</strong> will likely be too warm for summers in all but the northernmost parts of the world. And while identifying the temperature rating needed for your sleeping bag is a good first step, it’s by far the last decision you will have to make when it comes to your future sleeping bag. There are a few other variables that will affect what kind of sleeping bag you end up with.
<h2>15 Degree Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a 15 degree sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – Your choices of insulation are between down and synthetic, but down is by far the superior choice. It weighs comparatively less than synthetic insulation, and also compresses down better, for easy storage in a backpack. The only drawback is that you cant get down wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – If you plan on camping or backpacking in 15 degree temperatures then you will likely<!--more--> have to worry about rain. And if rain is a major concern, you should definitely be keeping your sleeping bag insulation dry. Wet sleeping bag insulation does a rather poor job of keeping you warm, especially if that insulation is down.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-apache-mf-sleeping-bag-15-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering Apache MF Sleeping Bag</a> - First up, a fantastic 15 degree sleeping bag from Western Mountaineering. It uses <strong>high quality 850+ fill down</strong>, and the exterior is made of Microlite XP, which will help repel water. It's a <strong>mummy shape</strong>, but even for a mummy sleeping bag it has a minimalist, streamlined shape that helps to save on weight.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-spiral-down-hugger-1-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - From Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell, another excellent 15 degree sleeping bag. This one weighs <strong>2 pounds or 907 grams</strong>, the same as the Apache MF above, but has a few slightly different features. First, it uses the slightly lower quality <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, but has a <strong>DWR, or durable water repellent finish</strong> on the exterior shell, which does a better job of water resistance. This one is also an award winner, having <strong>snagged the 2009 Gear of the Year award from Outside magazine</strong>. So another excellent 15 degree sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808964/marmot-plasma-15-sleeping-bag\">Marmot Plasma 15</a> - At <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 900 grams</strong>, this is just slightly the lightest 15 degree sleeping bag on this list.

Good snowshoes can make a day of snowshoeing far more enjoyable than it otherwise would have been with a poor pair of snowshoes. And the difference doesn’t necessarily come down to price, either. You can get a great pair of snowshoes without spending a lot, provided that you know what you’re looking for before you go and buy a new pair of snowshoes.
<h2>Good Snowshoes</h2>
What to look for when you want good snowshoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> – There are actually three broad categories of snowshoes, those being general hiking snowshoes, backcountry snowshoes and running snowshoes. If you want good snowshoes, you first have to decide what you will be using your snowshoes for, and what kind of snowshoes you need.</li>
	<li><strong>Maximum Weight</strong> – You can get the fanciest, most expensive snowshoes on the market, but if you <!--more-->weigh more than the maximum recommended weight for those snowshoes, you will not have a good time. If you want to float across the surface of the snow, rather than ploughing through it, you need to get snowshoes that are big enough for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Good Snowshoes Reviews</h2>
Reviews of good snowshoes that wont fail you in the outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-mens\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens\">Women's Version</a>) - First, a really <strong>solid pair of mountaineering snowshoes</strong> that will keep you floating even with a heavy backpack on. They come in <strong>three different sizes, 22, 25 and 30 inches</strong>. The 30 inch version has a <strong>maximum capacity of 280 pounds</strong>, though you can also get <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-tail-snowshoe-flotation-tail-5-in\">attachable tails</a> that will add more to that. What makes these ideal for backcountry use, however, is the <strong>crampons cut in to the bottom of the outer aluminum frame</strong>. That way, you traction no matter how little of your snowshoes is in contact with the ground. They also have <strong>heel lift bars</strong>, to elevate your feet when ascending hills. A pair of very good snowshoes for mountaineering.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/race-snowshoes\">Atlas Race Snowshoes</a> - If you want to do a little running or even racing, then something like the Atlas Races snowshoes is likely a better fit. At <strong>2 pounds 1.3 ounces, or 943 grams</strong> these are some of the lightest snowshoes on the market, which is good if you're going to be running in them. They come in just one size, that will carry a <strong>maximum of 190 pounds</strong>, but with <strong>minimal crampons</strong> and their small size, these aren't meant to go off the beaten path. So a pair of <strong>good snowshoes for running</strong> and established trails.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805327/msr-evo-22-snowshoes\">MSR Evo 22 Snowshoes</a> - For a <strong>general recreation snowshoe</strong>, the Evo 22s excel. They're <strong>lightweight, at just 3 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.55 kilograms</strong>, due to their being made from plastic. They're only 22 inches in length so they will only carry a <strong>maximum of 180 pounds</strong>. But there are <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/703356/msr-evo-snowshoe-flotation-tails-6-inch\">attachable tails</a> that you can get to improve that maximum to 250 pounds, which is more than enough for the average person.</li>

Many people will spend hundreds of dollars on a good backpack, for example, but will neglect spending the money on a good pair of hiking socks. And while you can typically get by with a bad backpack, it’s a lot harder to make a bad pair of hiking socks work. The best men’s and <strong>women’s hiking socks</strong> can do quite a bit for you. But before you can get to that point, you have to do a little bit of research and find the right pair of hiking socks for you.
<h2>Women’s Hiking Socks</h2>
What you want to look at when shopping for women's hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – A sock is a sock, and there are only so many variables that go in to a sock, but the material they’re made from is a big one. Wool is the obvious choice that most people default to, but there are also a few synthetic options, usually blends, that will also do a good job of keeping your feet happy.</li>
	<li><strong>Toes</strong> – There are many people who get problems with their toes, particularly two or more toes rubbing<!--more--> together. If that describes some of the foot problems that you find yourself encountering, then a pair of hiking socks with individualized toes will help to alleviate a lot of these problems, and improve your hiking experience in the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Hiking Socks</h2>
A few of the better women's hiking socks on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795958/smartwool-phd-outdoor-ultra-light-mini-socks-womens\">SmartWool PhD Outdoor Ultra Light Mini Socks</a> - Merino wool will feel great against your skin, and the <strong>ultra light fabric means that your feet will breath well, and wont be too warm on even the hottest days</strong>. SmartWool uses a Wool on Wool system for their PhD line which gives you a <strong>bit of extra padding in high pressure areas</strong>, like the heel. Their PhD socks also come with their banded fit system, which makes sure that your socks stay in place and comfy on your feet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/teko-organic-sin3rgi-light-minicrew-running-sock-womens\">Teko Merino Light Mini Crew Sock</a> - Teko uses a combination of <strong>organic merino wool</strong> and a few other materials for a great blend of wool's insulating, breathable properties and the tight, stretchy fit of materials like lycra. Teko also gives you a <strong>bit of padding where it counts</strong>, like under the heel, and the lightweight fabric, plus some <strong>thinner, ventilating fabric on top of the foot</strong> ensures that your feet will have every chance to cool off and breath on those warm days.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hiking-tech-medium-crew-women-s\">Point 6 Hiking Tech Medium Crew</a> - If you're looking to head out in to temperatures that are a little colder, then a medium weight hiking sock is likely ideal. They're a <strong>combination of merino wool and a few other fabrics</strong>. The <strong>leg and instep are both reinforced, to cushion against heavier shoes or boots digging in</strong>. High impact areas, the like the heel, are also reinforced for maximum durability and comfort. And even though these are a medium weight sock they come with <strong>a few ventilation panels</strong>, so you don't get too hot in your shoes or boots.</li>

So an <strong>800 fill down jacket</strong> has down that is of a certain quality, and lofts a certain amount, loft being the method by which down keeps you warm. 900 fill down would be a higher quality than 800, but also more expensive, while 700 fill down would be a lower quality, but likely cheaper. 800 is a good middle ground. It’s not the high end stuff, but it’s relatively good, and will be lightweight and compressible, which is what you want from a down jacket.
<h2>800 Fill Down Jacket</h2>
Features to look for when looking for an 800 fill down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Regardless of what the quality of the down you’re using is, you will likely want to get a down jacket that has some sort of water resistance built in to the outer shell. Or even some sort of waterproof outer exterior. Down does a poor job of keeping you warm when it gets wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – Another important feature that you may or may not want on a down jacket, regardless <!--more-->of the quality, is a hood. Since down jackets shouldn’t be getting wet you don’t want to be getting a hood to keep your head dry. But if you want to keep your head warm, then a hood on your down jacket is a good idea.</li>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815693/patagonia-ultralight-down-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Jacket</a> - The Ultralight Down Jacket from Patagonia is a great, minimalist down jacket. It uses a <strong>durable water repellent finish to keep both you and the down dry</strong>, and has two zippered hand pockets, plus one zippered hand pocket on the chest to store a few essentials. It doesn't have a hood, and has a <strong>fairly fitted profile that makes it ideal for active outdoor pursuits</strong>. It weighs a total of <strong>8.5 ounces, or 240 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-parka-mens\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> - The Alpine Light <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and it's easy to see why. It's a <strong>thicker, midweight down jacket</strong> that will keep you warm in colder weather. The hood will help with that, of course, as will the 2 zippered hand pockets and the <strong>durable water repellent finish</strong> on exterior. Because it's a warmer jacket it does weigh more, at <strong>15.7 ounces or 445 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's 800 Fill Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815831/patagonia-ultralight-down-jacket-womens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Jacket</a> - First, a great minimalist down jacket from Patagonia. It has a <strong>great slim, low profile fit that makes it ideal for life outside</strong>. There's no hood, but there is two zippered hand pockets plus one zippered chest pocket that increase your options and will allow you to get your hands warm. The <strong>water repellent finish</strong> will keep both and the down inside your jacket warm. The whole thing weighs <strong>8 ounces, which is 226 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-parka-womens\">Mont Bell Alpine Light Down Parka</a> - If you're looking to stay warm when the temperature drops down low, something like the Alpine Light might be a better choice. It's got <strong>more down in it, for added warmth</strong>, which is obvious when you look at the weight, which is <strong>12.7 ounces, or 360 grams</strong>. It also has a <strong>durable water repellent finish</strong>, to keep you and the down dry in those colder conditions, and two zippered pockets, plus a hood, to keep your extremities toasty warm.

When you go hiking or backpacking in the summer, for instance, gaiters can help keep things like rocks and dust, and maybe even the occasional shower of rain if you’re unlucky out of your shoes. And in the winter, rain and snow and anything else that might find its way down in to your boots will be stopped by a good pair of women’s or <strong>men’s gaiters</strong>, though gaiters are generally fairly unisex.
<h2>Men’s Gaiters</h2>
Features to look at when buying men's gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Height</strong> – The one big difference between women’s and men’s gaiters is the height. Because men are taller on average, their gaiters generally have to be taller as well. Of course you don’t necessarily have to get the gaiters that go all the way up the lower leg, there are some excellent ankle gaiters choices as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – There are a wide variety of materials to choose from when buying gaiters. Gore Tex is a great choice if you want to stay dry, but others, like the more standard nylon, will be<!--more--> water resistant, and will also be more breathable. So decide on what you need your gaiters to do, and then find a material to match those needs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Men’s Gaiters</h2>
Some of the better pairs of men's gaiters, in a few different categories.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778003/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-low-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Rocky Mountain Low Gaiters</a> - First up, a great pair of ankle gaiters that are ideally suited to spring, summer and fall travel in the outdoors. They're <strong>nylon, which is great for breathability, but are also coated with a durable water repellent finish</strong>, so that they will also keep out mild amounts of rain or even snow. If you want something a little smaller and lightweight that wont suffocate your feet, these are them.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - If you're looking for a <strong>full length gaiter that is waterproof</strong>, but also plenty breathable, the Hispar gaiters are a great choice. The <strong>upper section is 3 layer eVent</strong>, which is both waterproof and very breathable, and is a great choice for a waterproof fabric. The <strong>bottom section is 500D cordura nylon</strong>, which will stand up to plenty of abuse. This is a great pair of gaiters for those rainy days when you're going to be staying active.</li>

The head is one of those areas of the body that leaks a lot of heat. And so if you want to be warmer, a good way to do that is to capture all that heat escaping from your body. And if you want to cool off quickly, all you need to do is take the hood down.
<h2>Hooded Soft Shell Jackets</h2>
What to look for when looking for hooded soft shell jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Besides a hood, a water resistant exterior is likely the most useful thing you will find on a soft shell jacket. It’s a wet world out there, after all, and if you want to survive a few rain showers without getting soaked yourself, a water resistant soft shell jacket is a very good idea.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulated</strong> – Many soft shell jackets also come with a bit of insulation on the inside. If you’re going <!--more-->to be using your jacket in the winter, or if there are plenty of cold months in the year where you live, an insulated soft shell jacket might be a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hooded Soft Shell Jackets</h2>
A few of the very best hooded soft shell jackets for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Hooded Soft Shell Jackets</strong></h3>

The hood also gets cinches up tight for bad weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hoody</a> - For those cold, frigid days, the Hyllus might be a better choice of shoft shell jacket.

But this is definitely not a jacket that will fail at the first sign of bad weather.

If the water is cloudy, of course, then it’s probably a good idea to have a water filter too, but for water that looks good and clean to begin with, all you really need is a water purifier to make the water drinkable. There are some distinct advantages for water purifiers over water filters. The <strong>best water purifier for backpacking</strong>, for instance, will be light enough that you wont even know you’re carrying it.
<h2>Best Water Purifier for Backpacking</h2>
What to consider when looking to buy the best water purifier for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Timeframe</strong> – The main disadvantage of a water purifier for backpacking, as opposed to a water filter, is that you have to wait for a water purifier to do its thing. Depending on the purification method, you can be waiting hours for all of the bad things in your water to be neutralized, so that you can then drink the water.</li>
	<li><strong>Purification Method</strong> – There is also more than one way to purify water. UV light, for example, is a good, and <!--more-->relatively fast method for purifying large amounts of water quickly. Chemicals are another option that backpackers often take advantage of, mainly because they’re so lightweight and simple to use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Purifier for Backpacking Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the best water purifiers for backpacking with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">Katadyn Micropur Purification Tablets</a> - The first and best option for many backpackers is chemical purification. The main drawback of tablets like these is that they <strong>take four hours to purify your water</strong>, so you might get a little thirsty while you wait for them to work. But the upside is that the <strong>30 tablet package will purify 30 liters of water, and the whole thing weighs 25 grams</strong>, which is less than 1 gram per liter of water. You cant get much lighter than that.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">Hydro Photon SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - The other major way to get your water purified is to treat it with UV light. The <strong>upside to UV light is that it works quickly</strong>. The Adventurer Opti will <strong>purify at a rate of 8 minutes per gallon</strong>, which is a lot less than the 4 hours for the tablets. The downside is that you need to <strong>replace the batteries every 50 liters</strong>, so you might need to carry extra batteries on a longer trip. The unit <strong>weighs 3.6 ounces, or 102 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/671111/msr-sweetwater-water-purifier-system\">MSR SweetWater Water Purifier System</a> - The SweetWater is more of a purifier system, as the name suggests. It's actually a <strong>combination of a .2 micron filter and a chlorine purification system</strong>, so that your water gets both filtered and purified before you drink it. Which might be overkill for relatively clean water, but likely <strong>just the thing for really dirty water</strong>. The SweetWater <strong>puts out 1+ liters per minute, and weighs in at 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>.</li>

If you’re just taking a compass along for emergencies situations then you don’t need anything special, but the <strong>best compass for backpacking</strong> will do a lot more than just get you out of a bad situation. In fact, with nothing more than a compass and a good map you can go hundreds of miles through backcountry without a trail and find your way without ever being lost.
<h2>Best Compass for Backpacking</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for the best compass for backpacking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sighting Mirror</strong> – If you’re going to be taking a lot of readings from your compass then a sighting mirror is an important feature to have. What it does is allow you to see the environment in front of you and the compass face at the same time, so that you can get the compass pointed in the right direction and align yourself properly.</li>
	<li><strong>Declination</strong> – For emergencies, magnetic north is good enough, but if you’re going to be navigating <!--more-->then it helps to properly align your compass to account for the difference between true north and magnetic north. A compass with an adjustable declination is precisely what you need to make that adjustment.</li>
</ul>

Find the best compass for backpacking, regardless of what you're intending to use it for.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/9041-glow-mate-compass\">Brunton 9041 Glow Mate Compass</a> - If all you want is something to <strong>find out which direction north is in an emergency situation</strong>, then the Glow Mate is an ideal choice. It's just a <strong>basic bubble compass</strong>, but it does indeed point north. It comes on a key ring for handy storage, and is luminous, though you should not be attempting to navigate at night unless it's absolutely necessary. It weighs a very resasonable <strong>.5 ounces, or 14 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/408150/suunto-m-3d-leader-compass\">Suunto M-3D Leader Compass</a> - This is a good, if slightly basic compass from Suunto. It comes with an <strong>adjustable declination</strong>, so that you can tell the difference between true north and magnetic north. It <strong>doesn't have a sighting mirror</strong>, however, which might become a little trying if you're going to be taking a lot of sightings with it. So a good compass for backpacking if you're not going to be using it constantly. It <strong>weighs 1.6 ounces, which is 45 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/brunton-15tdcl-mirrored-compass\">Brunton 15TDCL Mirrored Compass</a> - The 15TDCL is a solid choice for a backpacking compass that's going to see a lot of use. It comes with both <strong>an adjustable declination and a sighting mirror</strong>, so that you can tell the difference between magnetic north and true north, and you can also line up the topography in front of you with the compass face, to take accurate readings. It also <strong>comes with a slope meter</strong>, so that you can assess slopes for things like avalanche potential. The whole thing <strong>weighs 3 ounces, which is 85 grams</strong>.</li>

Of course that’s not the only thing that you have to pay attention to when buying a rain jacket. The huge varieties in rain jacket prices should tell you that there are a lot of options available to you when it comes to picking out a new rain jacket, hood or not.
<h2>Hooded Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for a hooded rain jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – A hood wont do you much good if it leaks, and lets water through to get your head wet. Hoods tend to have a lot of seams, for the hood itself and then for things like drawcords. And seams will often leak if they’re not properly sealed. So pay attention to the material your jacket is made out of, and just how waterproof the seams are.</li>
	<li><strong>Helmet Compatible</strong> – If you like to go skiing, snowboarding, climbing or anything else that requires a<!--more--> helmet, you might want to invest in a rain jacket that has a helmet compatible hood. In practice this just means a hood that will fit over a helmet, though some manufacturers do an excellent job of making your hood work with a helmet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hooded Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best hooded rain jackets for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796005/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795592/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - First a <strong>solid, but cheap hooded rain jacket</strong> made by Patagonia. It uses <strong>Patagonia's own H2No fabric</strong> to waterproof you and allow moisture to escape. It has all the basics, like pit zips, a hood and a couple of hand warmer pockets. The hood is not helmet compatible, but really the <strong>main feature of this rain jacket is the low price</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - If price isn't as much of a concern and you're really looking for the best possible hooded rain jacket, then the Alpha SV is a good choice. The SV stands for severe weather, and there are a number of features that make it ideal for just that. Like the <strong>Gore Tex 3L Pro fabric</strong>, for instance, that will definitely keep you dry in all kinds of bad weather. There are pit zips, and the <strong>hood is helmet compatible</strong>, but what sets the SV apart is the small stuff, like a design that <strong>minimizes the amount of seams, and seams that are laminated</strong>, rather than just taped. This is a hooded rain jacket for serious outdoor use.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - The Super Mica is a jacket <strong>designed specifically for backpackers and hikers</strong> who want a jacket that is lightweight, and will stand up to the unique demands of wearing a backpack. The <strong>shoulders and hips, for instance, are reinforced</strong> so that your backpack straps wont rub and damage the exterior of the jacket. The <strong>hand pockets are also raised just a bit</strong>, so that you can access them without having to unclip your backpack hip belt. And it's made with <strong>Marmot's very lightweight and breathable fabric called MemBrain</strong>, so that the jacket wont take up too much room in your backpack.</li>

This difference in weight means that your legs and back will feel a lot better at the end of the day. Another advantage of ultralight sleeping bags that isn’t immediately apparent to most people is that they also tend to compress down smaller, which helps to eliminate bulk in your backpack.
<h2>Ultralight Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when you want an ultralight sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulating Material</strong> – If you’re going for an ultralight sleeping bag then you likely want to choose down over synthetic as your insulating material. But there are several different qualities of down, ranging from something like 600+ fill down, all the way up to the very high quality 900+ fill down.</li>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – If you want ultralight, you’re best choice for shape is a mummy sleeping bag. Mummy bags <!--more-->eliminate a lot of unnecessary space by being tapered towards the feet, which also helps to eliminate dead air within the sleeping bag that can make the interior colder.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the very best ultralight sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - If you want an ultralight sleeping bag for summer conditions, it's difficult to do better than the HighLite. It's packed with just enough high quality <strong>850+ fill down to make it warm down to the 35 degree mark</strong>. So enough warmth for summer, but not much else in most parts of the world. Features like a <strong>half length zipper, stream lined cut and extra large square baffles</strong> are all designed to save as much weight as possible. And at just <strong>1 pound, or 453 gram</strong>s, it's light enough that you wont even notice you're carrying it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-1-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - Another very ultralight sleeping bag, this one from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell. Mont Bell actually uses a unique design feature, where the <strong>sleeping bag is cut at a 45 degree angle so that it coils and squeezes as you move around at night</strong>, to add warmth without adding weight. The sleeping bag is stuffed with <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and has a <strong>DWR finish on the exterior</strong> to keep the down dry, and you warm. It's <strong>warm down to 15 degrees</strong>, and weighs a very respectable <strong>2 pounds 4 ounces, which is 1.02 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom +0</a> - One more ultralight sleeping bag, this one <strong>warm down to 0 degrees</strong>. Part of what makes this such a great ultralight choice is that it uses a very <strong>narrow alpine mummy cut</strong>, which minimizes unused internal space as much as possible, without actually making you feel cramped. That, plus <strong>800+ fill down</strong> and a few weight saving features like a <strong>3/4 length zipper</strong> make the Phantom one of the lightest 0 degree sleeping bags, at just <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms</strong>, which is only slightly heavier than the much colder Mont Bell sleeping bag above.</li>

Family camping is often the first introduction that many youngsters get to the outdoor experience, and you want it to be a good one. At the same time, you don’t want to be carrying a big, heavy <strong>family camping tents</strong> if you’re doing anything more than car camping. So you need to balance these two things, comfort and weight, while sorting through the many different options available to you when buying a tent.
<h2>Family Camping Tents</h2>
What to look for when buying family camping tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – How big the family is will determine how big of a tent you buy. Be aware that larger tents are disproportionately heavy, so two three man tents, for example, will be much lighter than one six man tent. If you’re going to be backpacking, it will pay to keep this in mind.</li>
	<li><strong>Season Appropriate</strong> – Most people stick to camping in the spring, summer or fall, for which a three season tent will <!--more-->most likely be appropriate. But if you plan to go camping in winter, you should seriously consider a four season tent. Consider getting one three season tent and one four season tent, actually, since the four season tent will be quite a bit heavier.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Family Camping Tents</h2>
Some of the very best family camping tents to choose from, in a variety of shapes and sizes.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent-3-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek U.L. 3</a> - For smaller families, or for those that are looking to save on weight as much as possible, there is the <strong>three season</strong> Fly Creek line from Big Agnes. The two man version <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, in large part because at <strong>3 pounds 3 ounces, or 1.44 kilograms</strong> it's one of the lightest dome tents on the market. It has<strong> room for three inside</strong>, though there is also a <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul4-tent-4-person-3-season\">4 man version</a>. It's not the cheapest tent in the world, but if you're going to be carrying your family camping tent, it pays to make it as lightweight as possible.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/794298/rei-half-dome-4-tent\">REI Half Dome Tent</a> - If you just want something cheap that will put a roof over your head, the Half Dome is a good choice. At <strong>7 pounds 1 ounce, or 3.2 kilograms</strong> no one is ever going to call it lightweight, but it's a <strong>solid 3 season tent</strong> that has <strong>room inside for four</strong>. It also comes with <strong>two doors and two vestibules</strong>, making it easy for everyone to enter and exit the tent without crawling all over each other. So a good family camping tent if you're not looking for anything too serious.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flying-diamond-6-tent-6-person-4-seas\">Big Agnes Flying Diamond</a> - If you want a <strong>4 season tent</strong>, then you are going to need something a little more robust. The Flying Diamond from Big Agnes has enough <strong>room inside for 6</strong> to sleep comfortably, though at <strong>18 pounds 2 ounces, or 8.22 kilograms</strong> you better hope that you're not the person that gets stuck carrying it. It comes with <strong>2 doors, and a zipper partition that you can use to separate the interior space</strong> in to two different rooms, to make sleeping at night a little less crowded. Definitely not lightweight, but then a large four season tent is never going to be lightweight.</li>

A thick fleece jacket will not only keep you warm and toasty in even the coldest conditions, it will also help quite a bit to help cut down on wind chill. Thinner fleece jackets can be quite permeable, when it comes to the wind, and are not the best jacket to be caught out in wind with. But a thick fleece jacket is great for a wide variety of cold weather conditions.
<h2>Thick Fleece Jacket</h2>
What to look for when you want a thick fleece jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If a thick fleece jacket by itself wont cut it, as far as warmth goes, then a hood will help quite a bit. Your head is one of those areas of the body that just leaks heat, and so if your goal is to stay warm, there’s few things better than sticking something on your head, like a hood, to capture all that escaping heat and direct it back at you.</li>
	<li><strong>Windproof</strong> – A thick fleece jacket, just by virtue of being thick will do a good job of cutting down<!--more--> on wind chill. But if you really want to be impervious to the wind, a thick fleece jacket with a hardened outer surface will be a lot more resistant to wind chill than just a thick fleece jacket.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thick Fleece Jacket</h2>
Some of the best choices for a thick fleece jacket for men or women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785468/mountain-hardwear-monkey-man-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Fleece Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - If you want a thick fleece jacket, there are few choices better than the Monkey Man (Monkey Woman for women). It's made with <strong>heavy 300 weight fleece</strong>, for starters, which is the thickest fleece available. It also has <strong>a raised, piled exterior</strong> that adds to your warmth, and the fleece's ability to keep wind and water at bay. <strong>No hood, but you do get a couple of zippered hand warmer pockets</strong>, plus one zippered chest pocket. A very thick, basic fleece.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Hoody</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-softshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Hyllus is a thick fleece jacket with some serious features that make it perfect for those who like to go and get active. It uses the <strong>heavy 300 weight fleece</strong> as well, but also has a <strong>hardened, soft shell exterior that makes it water and weather resistant</strong>. That, plus a hood, zippered hand warmer pockets and a small pocket on the arm for a few essentials make this the perfect fleece jacket for hiking, climbing mountains and everything in between.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/r4-jacket-men-s\">Patagonia R4</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/r4-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - The R4 is the<strong> thickest and warmest fleece that Patagonia makes</strong>. The <strong>collar and cuffs are lined with microfleece</strong>, for a close but comfortable fit to keep heat in. It doesn't have a hood, but it does have a couple hand pockets, plus a zippered chest pocket. It also has a few small but thoughtful features, like  shoulder yokes that are sightly offset, so that you don't have any discomfort from backpack straps. Another very good and very thick fleece jacket.</li>

If it’s raining, the first place that the rain is going to hit is the top of your hood, and most manufacturers give you a hood on your rain jacket, since they don’t want you getting wet. But still, there is more to a men’s or <strong>women’s rain jacket with hood</strong> than just the hood. You need to make sure that the hood isn’t going to leak, for instance, and that the rest of the jacket is going to perform up to your expectations and needs.
<h2>Women’s Rain Jacket with Hood</h2>
What to look for from a women's rain jacket with hood.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – There are typically a lot of seams on a hood. You have the fabric of the hood itself, which needs to be round to accommodate your head, and then things like drawcords that need to be built in to the hood. Each one of these seams is a potential leak, if the seams and zippers on your jacket have not been properly waterproofed.</li>
	<li><strong>Helmets</strong> – Some hoods are made to be big enough for just your head, while many other rain jackets with a <!--more-->hood are meant to be compatible with wearing a helmet. So if you’re a rock climber, skier, snowboarder or anyone else who needs a jacket that will work with a hood, look for a rain jacket that is helmet compatible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Women’s Rain Jacket with Hood</h2>
Some of the very best rain jackets with hood for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-minimalist-jacket-womens-mar1075\">Marmot Minimalist</a> - If you want a Gore Tex jacket, but don't want to spend a lot then the <strong>Paclite, 2.5 layer Gore Tex</strong> the Minimalist is a good compromise. Like the name implies the Minimalist lacks much beyond the basics, like a hood, pit zips and a few pockets for your hands. But that <strong>helps keep bulk and weight down</strong>, and it helps keep the price down too, which makes it a relatively cheap women's rain jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/803345/arcteryx-beta-ar-jacket-womens\">Arc'teryx Beta AR</a> - If you don't mind spending the money for a high quality Gore Tex jacket then the Beta AR is an ideal choice. Arc'teryx is well known for making quality jackets that don't skip on the details. Besides the obvious, like pit zips and hand pockets, it also has a <strong>helmet compatible hood, along with a minimal amount of seams that are laminated, rather than just taped</strong>, for true waterproofing. So a <strong>more expensive 3L Pro Gore Tex</strong> rain jacket, but with plenty of features to justify the price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-extreme-gaiter-men-s\">GoLite Tumalo Pertex Storm</a> - GoLite's mission statement is right there in the name, to make equipment that allows you to go lighter. And this is one of the lightest rain jackets that GoLite makes. It's a <strong>waterproof / breathable treated nylon</strong> and just the essentials, including a storm hood, as the name suggests, and pit zips plus zippered hand pockets. So if you want a <strong>rain jacket with hood that you can throw in your bag and forget about, this is it</strong>.</li>

Part of it is just knowing which manufacturers make their sleeping bags in particularly long sizes. Of course at a certain point you might be too tall for just about all sleeping bags, and then a custom order might be called for.
<h2>Long Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for from a long sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulation Type</strong> – Regardless of the length of your sleeping bag, you need to decide on what kind of insulation you want your sleeping bag to have. Down is a lighter, more compressible option, but it tends to cost more. Synthetic insulation is cheaper, but also heavier, though it also performs better than down when it gets wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Long Sleeping Pad</strong> – If you’re looking for a long sleeping bag then you’ll likely need a long sleeping pad as well. Sleeping bag and sleeping pad lengths tend to be in roughly similar increments, so whatever sleeping bag length you end up, you <!--more-->should be able to find a sleeping pad length that is roughly similar to accommodate you.</li>
</ul>

Some of the best long sleeping bags on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810297/therm-a-rest-alpine-35-down-blanket\">Therm-A-Rest Alpine</a> - First up, a down blanket from Therm-A-Rest that will keep you <strong>warm down to 35 degrees</strong>. A <strong>blanket, or quilt</strong>, works with straps on the bottom, rather than sleeping bag. Quilts are difficult to make work in cold conditions, but with a minimum temperature rating of 35 degrees you wont be using this for anything but summer camping. The quilt is<strong> filled with 700 fill down</strong>, and doesn't have a hood, so if you're an inch or two taller than the <strong>maximum of 6 feet 8 inches</strong>, you wont have too much to worry about. The whole thing weighs <strong>1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-bighorn-bx-sleeping-bag-20-degree-heatshield\">The North Face Bighorn Bx</a> - A good, solid and very reasonably priced long sleeping bag from The North Face. The<strong> regular length for this is 6 feet 4 inches, while the long goes all the way to 6 feet 8 inches</strong>, which is about as long as you can expect to find on a sleeping bag. It uses <strong>synthetic insulation</strong>, and has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 20 degrees</strong>. At <strong>3 pounds 15 ounces, or 1.78 kilograms</strong> for the regular length it's not the lightest sleeping bag in the world, but it does get the job done for those taller people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-hugger-1-sleeping-bag-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - There are just a few select sleeping bags that go longer than the industry standard for a long sleeping bag, which is <strong>6 feet 6 inches</strong>. And if all you need is 6 feet 6 inches, then this sleeping bag from Mont Bell is a good example of that length. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, and has a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>. It also has a <strong>water repellent exterior</strong>, to help keep the insulation dry, and a couple other features like a draft collar that will help to keep you warm. But what stands out here is a very impressive weight of just <strong>2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong> for the long size, which compares very favorably to the two sleeping bags above, relative to warmth.</li>

But if you want to save even more, it’s entirely possible to find a good pair of <strong>cheap hiking shoes</strong> that wont empty out your wallet but will keep your feet comfortable over a long day of hiking. A sale is a good place to start when looking for a low price, but as long as you know what to look for, finding a pair of cheap hiking shoes that wont fall apart is relatively easy.
<h2>Cheap Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you want cheap hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – If you want waterproof hiking shoes you’re going to have to spend a little more money, which is why, if you want cheap hiking shoes, it’s best to stick with hiking shoes that aren’t waterproof. As long as you’re not spending too much time in the rain and puddles, a breathable pair of hiking shoes that aren’t waterproof is actually a better choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Generally, a lightweight pair of hiking shoes is going to cost more, because of the superior materials and construction. There are some exceptions, of course, but <!--more-->if you’re looking for cheap hiking shoes you shouldn’t expect to see too many pairs of lightweight hiking shoes.</li>

<h3><strong>Men's Cheap Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829185/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-mens\">New Balance MT10 Minimus</a> - The Minimus hiking shoes from New Balance are cheap because there's not a whole lot to them. They have a <strong>very thin, minimal Vibram sole</strong> that gives you a good sense of what's underneath you, and a simple but <strong>well ventilated upper</strong> that will keep air circulating and sweaty feet at bay. A really fantastic pair of cheap hiking shoes if you want something minimal, that will give you a good indication of the barefoot experience.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-moab-ventilator-hiking-shoe-mens\">Merrell Moab Ventilator</a> - Another pair of cheap hiking shoes <strong>built with ventilation in mind</strong>. These have a thicker, more traditional Vibram sole, but also have a <strong>well ventilated upper</strong> that isn't anything too fancy, but will do a good job of keeping air circulating. Another very solid pair of cheap hiking shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Cheap Hiking Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814347/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-womens\">New Balance WT10 Minimus</a> - The Minimus is certainly not a cheaply built pair of hiking shoes, but <strong>there's so little to them that the price cant be all that high</strong>. They're a shoe that <strong>helps simulate the barefoot hiking experience</strong>. The <strong>soles are rather thin</strong>, but they're good quality and made by Vibram. The <strong>upper portion is simple, but well ventilated</strong>, so that air can circulate freely inside your shoe, and you don't get overheated. So if you prefer something minimalist, these are a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-moab-ventilator-hiking-shoe-womens\">Merrell Moab Ventilator</a> - If you're interested in a<strong> cheap pair of more traditional hiking shoes</strong>, The Moab Ventilators are ideal. The <strong>sole is a basic, but solid model from Vibram</strong>, and the upper portion has plenty of ventilation so that your feet never overheat, even when the temperature is way up there.

Many people end up strapping their cup to the outside of their backpack so that it’s easily accessible, and so that they don’t have to deal with packing it in an efficient way. But <strong>collapsible cups for camping</strong> are different. You can throw them in to your backpack and not be afraid about them getting damaged. You also don’t have to worry about them taking up unnecessary room, because obviously, they collapse down.
<h2>Collapsible Cups – Camping</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for collapsible cups for camping with.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Set</strong> – There isn’t a lot of variety out there when it comes to collapsible cups for camping, but one is that the cups will sometimes come in a set with other camping cookware, like a bowl. So if you don’t have something to eat out of as well, then getting a set is a good idea, because if you take only one food receptacle camping, a bowl is a good choice.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When it comes to the material used for your collapsible cup, you have a few different choices. There is the bendy silicon kind that you<!--more--> can crush and maul without damaging. There is also the kind that collapses down in to a flat disc, which is a lot easier to pack than just a regularly shaped cup.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Collapsible Cups – Camping</h2>
A few of the very best collapsible cups for taking camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sea-to-summit-x-cup\">Sea to Summit X Cup</a> - Sea to Summit has a whole line of collapsible bowls, plates and cups as well. The X cup will <strong>hold 250 milliliters when fully extended</strong>, but folds down flat, accordion style, when it's not needed so that you don't have to worry about packing around it when packing up camp. The whole thing also weighs just <strong>1.6 ounces, or 45 grams</strong>, which is a very respectable weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752844/guyot-designs-squishy-bowl-and-cup-set\">Guyot Designs Squishy Bowl and Cup</a> - This is actually a <strong>set of bowl and cup</strong> from Guyot Designs. It uses a <strong>very flexible and squishy silicon</strong>, and so rather than being rigid and collapsing in a specific way it just squishes flat wherever you happen to put it in your backpack. The cup will <strong>hold 177 milliliters</strong>, which is not a whole lot, but it's definitely a design alternative worth considering. The cup by itself <strong>weighs 1.7 ounces, or 48 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-collapsible-fairshare-mug\">GSI Outdoors Collapsible Fairshare Mug</a> - The Fairshare mug collapses down accordion style just like the X Cup above, but does have a few distinct differences from that collapsible cup. It <strong>comes with a lid, for instance, to keep things warm, as well as a folding handle</strong> so that you don't end up burning your hands. The cup <strong>will hold 650 milliliters</strong>, so quite a bit more than either of the two cups above. There's no word on how heavy it is, but judging by the extra capacity and the lid, it's likely heavier than the other two.</li>

One is that synthetic insulation performs better when wet, so if you foresee your sleeping bag getting wet a lot while you’re using it, a synthetic sleeping bag might be a better choice. And of course synthetic sleeping bags tend to cost less than the down sleeping bags, which is never a bad thing.
<h2>Synthetic Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for synthetic sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Once you’ve decided on an insulation type for your sleeping bag you need to decide on a shape as well. A rectangular sleeping bag will weigh more than a mummy shaped sleeping bag, and if you’re going to be carrying your sleeping bag in a backpack, you will want a mummy shaped one, both for the weight savings and also the reduced bulk.</li>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – You also need to decide on a temperature rating for your synthetic sleeping bag. Synthetic insulation is<!--more--> better suited for wet conditions, so if you’re looking for a sleeping bag for fall, winter or spring you will want to be looking on the lower end of the scale, and maybe even in to the negative temperatures.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Synthetic Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the best synthetic sleeping bags, at a few different temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-spiral-burrow-bag-5-sleeping-bag-synthetic\">Mont Bell Super Spiral Burrow Bag #5</a> - First up, a synthetic sleeping bag for those warm nights. With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 40 degrees</strong> those warm nights is about all it's good for, but then you get to carry less weight too, which is a nice bonus. The insulation, specifically, is Exceloft, and the whole thing <strong>weighs 1 pound 15 ounces, or 878 grams</strong>. So a fantastic warm weather synthetic sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747873/mountain-hardwear-ultralamina-32-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Ultralamina</a> - With a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 32 degrees</strong> this is a solid, and very popular three season sleeping bag. It has a close fitting mummy cut, to help save on weight, and at <strong>1 pound 15 ounces, or 878 grams</strong>, it's approximately the same weight as the Mont Bell bag above, but significantly warmer. The specific insulation is Thermic Microfill. A great three season synthetic sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-cats-meow-sleeping-bag-20-degree-synthetic\">The North Face Cat's Meow</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-cats-meow-sleeping-bag-20-degree-synthetic-womens\">Women's</a>) - One more synthetic sleeping bag, this one ideal for winter in many parts of the world with a <strong>minimum temperature rating of 20 degrees</strong>. It uses Climashield insulation, and has a <strong>water resistant exterior shell</strong>, so that the insulation wont get wet when the weather turns ugly. The extra warmth does come at a price, however, which is a weight of <strong>2 pounds 12 ounces, or 1.24 kilograms</strong>. But compared to other 20 degree synthetic sleeping bags, it's a great choice.</li>

But a rain jacket can also be a bulky, heavy piece of gear. Which is why it’s better to get an <strong>ultralight rain jacket</strong>, so that you don’t have to lug around something big and heavy. This is especially true if you’re a backpacker, hiker or anyone else who will be carrying your rain jacket in your backpack until you need it. An ultralight rain jacket will fit in there and take up a minimal amount of space, so that you can forget about it until you need it.
<h2>Ultralight Rain Jacket</h2>
What to look for when reviewing ultralight rain jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – When you’re trying to find an ultralight rain jacket the most important thing that you need to pay attention to is the material it’s made out of. You want something that is both ultralight but still waterproof. So something like eVent is a good choice, as is something like Gore Tex Paclite.</li>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – Many manufacturers will cut corners with the seams and zippers on an ultralight jacket, and<!--more--> make them water resistant, rather than waterproof, to save on weight. But the last thing you want is for those seams and zippers to start leaking when the rain really starts falling, because you will get wet, even if the rest of your jacket is waterproof.</li>

<h2>Best Ultralight Rain Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best ultralight rain jackets for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-2-5-storm-jacket-men-s\">GoLite Tumalo Pertex Storm Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tumalo-pertex-strom-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - It's right there in the name, GoLite is a company dedicated to allowing you to go light. And the Tumalo is actually <strong>GoLite's lightest rain jacket</strong>, so you know you're getting something lightweight and high quality.  It has the essential features, like pit zips, a hood and a few pockets for your hands, but beyond that there's not much to this jacket, which is what you would expect from an ultralight rain jacket. It <strong>weighs in at 9 ounces, or 245 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827541/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-mens\">Marmot Minimalist Rain Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/762351/marmot-minimalist-rain-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Minimalist is <strong>one of the lightest Gore Tex jackets</strong> you will find on the market. It uses the <strong>2.5 layer, Paclite Gore Tex</strong>, which is the lighter, more breathable version of the popular fabric. It has the basics like pit zips and a few hand pockets, plus one zippered chest pocket for a few essentials. But it lives up to its Minimalist name with a distinct lack of any superfluous features. Still, it's Gore Tex, so it does weigh a bit more, at <strong>15 ounces or 425 grams</strong>, but it's definitely one of the lightest Gore Tex jackets you will find.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-super-mica-jacket-mens-mar1652\">Marmot Super Mica Jacket</a> - The Super Mica is a jacket constructed with anyone who wears a backpack in mind. The <strong>hand pockets are raised slightly</strong>, for instance, so that you can get in to them without undoing your hip belt. And the <strong>hips, along with the shoulders are reinforced</strong>, so that you don't have to worry about hours of rubbing damaging the waterproof fabric, which is <strong>Marmot's own MemBrain, 2.5 layer fabric</strong>. And at<strong> 8 ounces, or 226 grams it's the lightest rain jacket on this list</strong>, and so an excellent choice if you're shopping for an ultralight rain jacket.</li>

Most campers are on their feet far more than they are used to, which can lead to all kinds of foot problems. And when your feet aren’t happy, it’s hard to really enjoy the camping experience. Worst of all, most foot problems continue to get worse unless you really get proactive about them early on. So if you want to enjoy yourself while camping, a good pair of camping shoes really is essential.
<h2>Camping Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you want the best camping shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Boots tend to be heavy, while shoes are lighter, but even camping shoes can be rather heavy, and you really do want to pay attention to the weight of your camping shoes. Just remember that every pound on your feet is equal to roughly five pounds on your back, in terms of energy expended.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – If you’re camping where it’s wet then you may want to invest in a pair of waterproof camping shoes. But <!--more-->otherwise, the more breathable your camping shoes are, the better. Especially for those hot days in the sun, you want camping shoes that will allow plenty of air flow, and not stifle your feet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Shoes</h2>
Some of the very best camping shoes for those outdoor pursuits.
<h3><strong>Men's Camping Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-mens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR</a> - The Hedgehogs are an ideal <strong>waterproof camping shoe</strong>. They are built with an <strong>XCR Gore Tex liner</strong> that will keep water out but will also breath well. The outer portion of the shoe is a combination of mesh and leather, which will offer some limited protection from water but mostly will help increase breathability, and let the Gore Tex handle keeping your feet dry. A <strong>solid Vibram sole</strong> rounds out the package, making these a fantastic pair of camping shoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829185/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-mens\">New Balance MT10 Minimus</a> - If you don't need a pair of waterproof camping shoes then something like the Minimus might be more ideal. They're <strong>very breathable, making them ideal for warmer temperatures</strong>, and have a<strong> low, minimalist design</strong> that has a few benefits. You can actually feel the ground beneath your feet through the sole, to a limited extent anyway, which can help you react to uneven and slippery terrain better, and maybe even avoid an injury or two. So lightweight and breathable pair of camping shoes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Camping Shoes</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoe-womens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR</a> - The Hedgehogs are an ideal pair of camping shoes if what you need more than anything is to stay dry. The <strong>Gore XCR Gore Tex liner</strong> will do a good job of that, while the mostly mesh upper portion of the shoe will do a good job of allowing the Gore Tex to breath. That mesh wont stop much water, but the Gore Tex will. And on the bottom you have a <strong>solid Vibram sole</strong> that will give you plenty of traction on questionable terrain. So a really ideal, fully featured pair of camping shoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814347/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoes-womens\">New Balance WT10 Minimus</a> - The Minimus camping shoes are at the other end of the spectrum from the Hedgehogs above. They're <strong>small, lightweight and very breathable</strong>, and not at all waterproof. They're the perfect shoe for hot days when rain is unlikely. They have a<strong> relatively thin sole</strong>, and a very breathable upper portion. So the perfect camping shoe for those that prefer a minimal sort of design.</li>

The <strong>best camping coffee maker</strong> will be small and lightweight enough that you’ll hardly even notice you’re carrying it. In fact, some are small and lightweight enough that the coffee beans might actually weigh more. It all depends, of course, on how you like your coffee made in the morning.

What to look for when you're in the market for the best camping coffee maker.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re not car camping and you’re going to be carrying your camping coffee maker around with you, your best choice is going to be a lightweight camping coffee maker. That way you don’t have to carry any more weight than is strictly necessary, but still get a good cup of coffee every morning.</li>
	<li><strong>Method</strong> – There are a few different ways to make coffee when you’re at home, and there are also a few different ways<!--more--> to make coffee in the outdoors.

<h2>Best Camping Coffee Maker Reviews</h2>
Reviews of some of the very best camping coffee makers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/coffee-drip-folding\">Snow Peak Coffee Drip</a> - One of the more common ways to make coffee is with a <strong>drip filter</strong>, and Snow Peak offers a great way to get your drip coffee while camping. This drip filter <strong>will sit right on a wide variety of different sizes of cups or mugs</strong>, and will drip away while you break down camp or make breakfast. And when you're done with it it's easy to clean, being <strong>stainless steel</strong>, and breaks down and folds flat, for easy storage. The whole thing weighs <strong>4.9 ounces, or 138 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/snow-peak-titanium-cafe-press\">Snow Peak Titanium Cafe Press</a> - If you prefer your coffee from a<strong> french press</strong> then Snow Peak has you covered there too. This is a <strong>combination of press and pot</strong>. The good thing about this is that the pot can be used to cook in too, though it's a little tall and narrow for some foods. But still, a viable cooking option that could allow you to take just one pot for two different purposes. It's <strong>titanium, and the whole thing weighs 6.3 ounces, or 178 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/726094/msr-mugmate-coffeetea-filter\">MSR MugMate Coffee and Tea Filter</a> - The MugMate was the <strong>2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award winner</strong>, mostly because it's just a lightweight and easy to use coffee filter. It's the same design as a tea immersion filter, but with a finer filter to keep coffee grounds out. It allows you to <strong>make your coffee as weak or strong as you like</strong>, is easy to clean and easy to reuse. Best of all, it weighs just <strong>1 ounce, which is 28 grams</strong>, and much lighter than the other two options above.</li>

If you don’t you might be slowed down to a crawl by the darkness, and you’re also at much greater risk for getting lost or hurting yourself. Fortunately, it’s easy to stuff a hiking headlamp in to your backpack and forget about it. And then, when you really need it you can pull it out and have it at your disposal.
<h2>Hiking Headlamp</h2>
What you want to look for when you're looking for a hiking headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Power Settings</strong> – It’s best if your hiking headlamp has more than one power setting. That way, when you’re covering ground at night you can turn it up so that every rock and root is completely illuminated. And when you want to conserve batteries you can turn the power down and make do with a fraction of the light.</li>
	<li><strong>Red LED</strong> – When you turn your headlamp or flashlight off at night there is that time when you have to let your eyes adjust to the darkness. But with red <!--more-->light there’s no adjustment period, because red light doesn’t ruin your night vision. So a hiking headlamp with either red LEDs or a red lens for the white LEDs is a useful thing to have when out hiking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Headlamp</h2>
A select few of the best hiking headlamps for your consideration.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - If you plan to be moving fast while hiking at night and want as much light as possible, then the Ultra is a great choice. It puts out a very<strong> impressive 350 lumens</strong>, which is <strong>enough to illuminate 120 meters</strong> of space in front of you. Of course 350 lumens of light takes quite a bit of battery power, and at that high setting the Ultra will only last for 2 hours. Even at the <strong>lowest power setting, you can only expect 17 hours of light</strong>. This is a headlamp designed for one thing, and that's brightness. It also does not have a red light mode, and <strong>weighs 12.1 ounces, or 346 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm Headlamp</a> - The Storm is designed for what the name suggests, a storm. It's the headlamp you want when the rain starts falling, since it's <strong>completely waterproof</strong>. It also includes <strong>2 red LEDs</strong>, so red light mode actually becomes a legitimate lighting mode. On the highest power setting you can expect approximately <strong>100 lumens of light</strong>, and approximately <strong>200 hours of light on the lowest power setting</strong>. And it weighs a very reasonable <strong>3.7 ounces, or 104 grams</strong> with the batteries in.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829552/petzl-zipka-plus-2-headlamp\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2 Headlamp</a> - If you want lightweight, then the Zipka is perfect. Part of what makes it such a small and lightweight choice is a retractable headband, which makes the Zipka small enough to throw in a pocket when you're not using it. It puts out <strong>70 lumens on the highest setting, while you can expect approximately 155 hours on the lowest power setting</strong>. It also includes <strong>a red LED</strong>. And you get all that for just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong> with the batteries in. An excellent hiking headlamp in a very small package.</li>

For starters, foam sleeping mats tend to be lighter than their inflatable counterparts. They’re a great deal more bulky, of course, which might lead you to believe that they’re heavier, but if you can accommodate the extra bulk on your backpack then you should be able to save a few ounces of weight.
<h2>Foam Sleeping Mat</h2>
What to look for in a foam sleeping mat.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Unlike inflatable sleeping mats, foam sleeping mats tend to be almost all rectangular. Which is not to say that it is impossible to find a mummy shaped foam mat. There is also always the option of taking an exacto knife to your rectangular foam sleeping mat, since it’s a piece of equipment that is rather hard to break or damage.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – Regardless of the kind of sleeping mat you get, an important consider is the R-value of the sleeping pad. The <!--more-->higher the R-value is the more warmth will be reflected back at you when you sleep. In the winter, you definitely want as much warmth reflected back at you as possible, but in the summer it’s not much of a concern.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Foam Sleeping Mat</h2>
Some of the very best foam sleeping mats for your next camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/therm-a-rest-z-lite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest Z Lite</a> - The Z Lite is a great foam sleeping mat from Therm-A-Rest, which are well known for their many excellent sleeping mats. It uses an e<strong>gg carton shape on top</strong> to enhance comfort and help keep you warm. It's also rectangular, and has an <strong>R-value of 2.2</strong>. It's only <strong>.75 inches thick</strong>, but the egg carton top helps to give you as much comfort as possible. And in the morning, it folds up accordion style, for easy storage. Finally, the whole thing <strong>weighs 14.5 ounces, or 410 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810386/therm-a-rest-ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest RidgeRest SOlite</a> - The SOlite is another rectangular foam sleeping pad like the Z Lite above, but that's where the similarities end. It <strong>uses ridges</strong>, rather than an egg carton design on top, which helps enhance comfort. It's also only <strong>.625 inches thick</strong>, though again, the ridges help with comfort. It has a solid three season <strong>R-value of 2.8</strong>, and the whole thing weighs in at <strong>19 ounces, or 540 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/nightlight-sleeping-pad-torso-length.html\">Gossamer Gear Nightlight</a> - The Nightlight is what you take if you want to save on weight. It's a <strong>torso length pad</strong>, meaning that you let your feet and lower legs hang off, since they don't really need much padding anyway. More specifically, it's 29 inches long, and folds up in to thirds for easy storage. It has an <strong>egg crate design on top, and is .75 inches thick, with an R-value of 2.27</strong>. Best of all is the weight, of course, which is just<strong> 3.5 ounces, or 100 grams</strong>, which is significantly less than any of the other pads here.</li>

The rest of you will stay more or less dry, but your head is the highest thing on you, and with nothing between it and the elements, it’s going to get wet when the rain starts falling. So a <strong>rain jacket with hood</strong> is essential. But a hood is easy, there are a lot of other things that you need to pay attention to when buying a new rain jacket. There is a big difference between a rain jacket that will keep you dry, and one that will keep you dry, up to a point.
<h2>Rain Jacket with Hood</h2>
What to look for when shopping for a rain jacket with hood.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The material that you rain jacket is made out of will have a big influence on just how dry you stay when you’re wearing it and caught out in the rain. Something like Gore Tex, for instance, has a well deserved reputation of keeping people dry, whereas something like coated nylon will not do as good a job of keeping you dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Seams and Zippers</strong> – A jacket has all kinds of seams and zippers, and if those seams and zippers are not sealed properly, they will leak. And it might not seem like much, but<!--more--> over a long enough period of time you can get thoroughly soaked from a few zippers and seams that are letting water leak through.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rain Jacket with Hood</h2>
Some of the very best rain jackets with hood.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-alpha-sv-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Alpha SV Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795592/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Alpha SV is what you want if you want the best. It's certainly not cheap, but you do really get what you pay for. The Alpha SV has all of the basic features that you would expect from a rain jacket, like a <strong>waterproof exterior, courtesy of 3L Pro Gore Tex, and underarm zippers</strong> for ventilation. But it also has a number of extras, like a hood that's compatible with a helmet, a<strong> reduced number of seams and laminated seams</strong>, rather than taped seams, which makes them truly waterproof. It's the jacket you want to be wearing when it gets really ugly outside, and you don't want to get wet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796005/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795592/patagonia-torrentshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Torrentshell is a good, solid rain jacket, but <strong>is focused more on value</strong>. It uses <strong>Patagonia's own H2No fabric</strong> to keep you dry and well ventilated, along with a few underarm zippers to let hot air escape and cool air in. The zippers are water resistant, but unfortunately not waterproof, though features like a <strong>drawcord hem and hood</strong>, plus velcro cuffs will to keep you comfortable. But the main feature of this jacket really is the price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/super-mica-jacket-men-s\">Marmot Super Mica</a> - The Super Mica makes a perfectly good rain jacket, but where it really excels is when you're wearing a backpack. The <strong>hand zippers, for instance, are raised up</strong> so that you wont have to dig under your backpack's hip belt to get in to them. The <strong>hips and shoulders are also reinforced for extra durability</strong> where backpack straps will be rubbing. It's also rather lightweight and compact, due to Marmot's MemBrain fabric, which makes it ideal for stuffing in a backpack and forgetting about when it's not raining.</li>

The main benefit of a <strong>Gore Tex down jacket</strong> is that the down inside stays dry. Wet down has a tendency to clump together. When the down clumps together it doesn’t do a very good job of insulating you, and so you end up getting cold, at least until the down dries out and you can get it to unclump, which can take quite a while. So whatever you can do to keep the down inside your jacket dry is good.
<h2>Gore Tex Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for when buying a Gore Tex down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – If you’re going to get a Gore Tex down jacket then you might as well get one with a hood. Many people avoid down jackets with hoods for the simple reason that part of what a hood gets used for is protection from the rain, and you’re not supposed to get down wet. But the Gore Tex will keep the down dry, in a hood or anywhere else.</li>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – Gore Tex is a good material, but even Gore Tex will leak water if you get it wet enough over a long period of time. For that reason, it’s actually better to get lower quality down, because the higher quality stuff is more lofty, and will lose more insulating power when it gets wet and clumps.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gore Tex Down Jacket</h2>
Some of the best Gore Tex down jackets for both men and women.
<h3><strong>Men's Gore Tex Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-mountain-light-triclimate-jacket-mens\">The North Face Mountain Light Triclimate</a> - The Triclimate jacket from The North Face is an ideal waterproof jacket for a wide variety of conditions. It comes with a <strong>500+ fill down liner that can be removed</strong> when it's not cold enough to warrant all that warmth, leaving you with just a Gore Tex jacket. And the <strong>Gore Tex is the high quality 3L Pro fabric</strong>, so you know you're going to stay dry. The liner, incidentally, can be removed and worn, making this a true 3 in 1 jacket.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/patagonia-primo-down-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Primo Down Jacket</a> - The Primo is billed as ski jacket, but it's equally suited to all kinds of alpine adventures. It uses a <strong>2 layer Gore Tex outer shell</strong>, plus fairly high <strong>quality 700+ fill down</strong>. Since it's made for the snow you get a few potentially very useful features, like <strong>a snow skirt, and because it's all one piece, there are underarm zippers</strong> that you can use to stay cool when working hard.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Women's Gore Tex Down Jacket</strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-mountain-light-triclimate-jacket-womens\">The North Face Mountain Light Triclimate</a> - The Tricliamte is 3 jackets in one. The jacket itself is a very <strong>high quality 3L Pro Gore Tex shell. The 500+ fill down liner inside is removable</strong>, so you can wear either piece separately, or else both together for a very warm and waterproof jacket. So a really excellent combination of jackets that is versatile enough to keep you protected from the elements in a wide of weather conditions.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/818802/patagonia-primo-down-insulated-jacket-womens\">Patagonia Primo Down Jacket</a> - The Primo isn't a down liner and shell. Rather, it's a <strong>2 layer Gore Tex outer</strong> that's stuffed full of <strong>700+ fill down</strong>. It's actually made to be a ski jacket, though many of the features that make it ideal for skiing, such as a snow skirt, also make it a good choice for anything where you're going to be in the snow a lot. And since it's one piece, and not a removable liner, you also <strong>get pit zips</strong>, which are very useful if you're going to be active in the outdoors in your Gore Tex down jacket.</li>

One of the many advantages of an inflatable sleeping pad is that it tends to take up a lot less room than a foam sleeping pad. Foam sleeping pads can be strapped on to the outside of a backpack, but an inflatable sleeping pad packs up very small and fits in a backpack easily. Most people tend to find inflatable sleeping pads quite a bit more comfortable, as well.
<h2>Inflatable Sleeping Pad</h2>
What to look for when shopping for an inflatable sleeping pad.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> – Inflatable sleeping pads come in all different shapes and sizes, from a uniform rectangular shape to the mummy shaped sleeping pads, where corners are cut, literally, to make the sleeping pad in to a more tapered shape that eliminates as much excess material as possible, to help save on weight.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – Another important feature to consider when shopping for inflatable sleeping pads is the R-value of the sleeping pad, which determines how much of your body heat will <!--more-->be reflected. A sleeping pad with a high R-value will reflect a lot of body heat, making it an ideal choice for winter camping or backpacking.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Inflatable Sleeping Pad</h2>
Some of the very best inflatable sleeping pads.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is probably the <strong>most popular sleeping pad on the market</strong>, and with very good reason. First, it <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, which always helps with popularity. But it's also a <strong>rectangular sleeping pad that weighs just 14 ounces, or 400 kilograms</strong>, which is surprisingly lightweight for a rectangular pad. It's also <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong>, which is plenty of comfort, and has an <strong>R-value of 2.5</strong> which makes it ideal for three season camping. So a solid, lightweight inflatable sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - The DownMat is built with one thing in mind, and that's warmth. Unlike most other four season sleeping pads the DownMat uses down to insulate, rather than foam. The <strong>top is stuffed with 700+ fill goose down</strong>, which gives the DownMat an <strong>R-value of 8</strong>, which is <strong>warm enough to take you down to -36 or so</strong>. And because it uses down it manages to <strong>weigh 34.6 ounces, or 980 grams</strong>, which is very impressive relative to other sleeping pads with similar R-values. It's also rectangular, and comes in a larger, deluxe size.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\">Big Agnes Clearview</a> - The Clearview is a sleeping pad built for value, though it's also a rather good sleeping pad. With an <strong>R-value of just 1</strong> it's certainly not going to do much to add to your warmth at night, but it also <strong>weighs just 14 ounces, or 400 grams for the mummy version</strong>, and <strong>comes in a rectangular version as well</strong>. It also costs substantially less than either of the other two pads above.</li>

If you want a fairly bright headlamp that will really illuminate a large area, then a <strong>200 lumen headlamp</strong> is a good choice. Lumens is the unit of measurement for brightness, and the more lumens a headlamp can produce, the brighter that headlamp will be.
<h2>200 Lumen Headlamp</h2>
What to look for when what you want is a 200 lumen headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Power Settings</strong> – 200 lumens is a lot of light, and if you’re traveling at night, and need a lot of light, then it’s good to be able to get 200 lumens. But that much power will drain your batteries quickly, and it helps if you can turn the power down to something like 50 lumens, for when you’re just trying to find something in the bottom of your bag, and don’t need 200 lumens.</li>
	<li><strong>Color</strong> – One helpful feature that you’ll find on a lot of the better headlamps is the ability to switch the color of the light, either with different colors of LEDs or with a lens that will snap in to<!--more--> place over top of the white LEDs. Red light, for instance, doesn’t affect night vision, so you’re not temporarily blind after you switch red light off.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 200 Lumen Headlamp</h2>
Some of the very best 200 Lumen Headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808898/princeton-tec-apex-extreme-led-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Extreme</a> - The Apex Extreme is a very good and very bright headlamp. It gives you a <strong>beam distance of approximately 104 meters</strong>, and a total of 4 different power modes, plus a strobe setting. On the highest power setting you get about 2.5 hours of output, while dropping down to the <strong>lower setting gives you 30 hours</strong>. There's no red light mode, unfortunately, and the whole thing <strong>weighs in at 14.7 ounces, or 416 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/apex-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex</a> - The Apex is another very solid, bright headlamp choice from Princeton. It has an impressive <strong>beam distance of 116 meters</strong>, which beats the Apex Extreme. However, you get just 1 hour of battery life on the highest setting, and 14 hours on the lowest, so the Extreme above definitely has it beat when it comes to battery life. There's no red light mode on this Apex, but it does weigh a <strong>comparatively lightweight 8 ounces, or 226 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/princeton-tec-apex-pro-headlamp\">Princeton Tec Apex Pro</a> - Finally, the Apex Pro, one more excellent 200 lumen headlamp from Princeton Tec. The Apex Pro uses the same configuration of LEDs to provide 200 lumens and <strong>86 meters of beam distance</strong>, but uses superior batteries for a maximum burn time of 100 hours. It also <strong>weighs less, at 6.1 ounces, or 172 grams</strong>, making it an ideal choice for anyone looking for a 200 lumen headlamp.</li>

To see a <strong>full list of hiking backpack manufacturers and their products</strong>, head to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">backpacks list</a>.

There are many excellent <strong>hiking backpack brands</strong> out there to choose from. And while you have likely heard of most of the big ones, there are also some really excellent backpack brands that you have probably never heard of. Smaller manufacturers actually make some of the best backpacks around, and they do it right in the USA. But regardless, if you’re looking for a new hiking backpack, a good place to start is with a look at the different brands making hiking backpacks.
<h2>Hiking Backpack Brands</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Black Diamond</strong> - They <strong>don't make too many large backpacks, but if you're looking for something to stay active with on a day hike</strong>, a Black Diamond backpack might be ideal. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/axiom-30-pack-1800-cu-in\">Black Diamond Axiom</a>, for instance, is not particularly large, at just 30 liters, but is perfect for a day trip or even a weekend with a smaller amount of gear.</li>
	<li><strong>Deuter</strong> - Deuter makes a whole <strong>range of hiking backpacks, from small backpacks intended for just day trips, all the way up to large expedition backpacks</strong> with more storage capacity than most people will ever need, even for a week in the outdoors. The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795605/deuter-act-lite-65-10-pack\">ACT Lite 65</a> is a good example of something right in the middle. It's definitely a multi-day backpack, with<!--more--> 65 liters of storage capacity, and a popular choice in that capacity range.</li>
	<li><strong>GoLite</strong> - GoLite <strong>backpacks are designed, as the name suggests, to help you go light</strong>. Their products are designed to be lightweight and portable, ideal for backpacking or hiking without having to drag around what might feel like weights. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-jam-backpack-mens-3050cu-in\">GoLite Jam</a> is a great example of their product, and definitely one of their most popular backpacks. It's fairly small, doesn't have a frame and is relatively lightweight. You wont get a whole lot of gear in to it, but then that's kind of the point.</li>
	<li><strong>Granite Gear</strong> - Another hiking backpack manufacturer that <strong>makes a wide range of backpacks</strong>, from the small and lightweight all the way up to large backpacks intended for multi-day expeditions. Their <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824361/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-pack\">Blaze A.C. 60</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824384/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-ki-pack-womens\">Women's</a>) <strong>won the 2011 Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>, and is a popular choice. It's simple, but also durable and well built, and is a versatile choice for backpackers, hikers and campers.</li>
	<li><strong>Gregory</strong> - Yet another backpacker manufacturer that <strong>has products running the gamut, from small and lightweight, intended for a single day, all the way up to some monster backpacks</strong> that top out at over 100 liters of capacity, which is enough space to stuff a whole closet worth of clothing in to. The <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gregory-baltoro-75-backpack-4455-4760cu-in\">Baltoro 75</a> is a good example. It's big, can carry a lot of gear and isn't particularly lightweight. It's the kind of backpack you want when you're headed out for a serious adventure.</li>
	<li><strong>Osprey</strong> - Osprey <strong>makes it all, from big huge behemoths that might weigh more than you when they're fully loaded up, all the way down to smaller and lighter options</strong> for a weekend or even just a day. The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780218/osprey-exos-58-pack\">Exos</a> is one of their more popular backpacks, and a good example of their work. It's solid, and has all of the best features that you could want from a backpack, including plenty of ventilation along the back.</li>
	<li><strong>The North Face</strong> - A lot of The North Face's best products <strong>are designed around performing well in bad conditions on the side of a mountain</strong>, and their backpacks are no different. Many come with convenient spots to store an ice axe or skis, for instance, and are strong and durable. The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780218/osprey-exos-58-pack\">Prophet 40</a>, for instance, is big enough for an overnight trip or even a weekend in the mountains, and has plenty of storage options for bulky cold weather gear.</li>
	<li><strong>ULA Equipment</strong> - ULA Equipment is <strong>a favorite among many lightweight backpackers</strong> because of their excellent lightweight backpacks. The <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">Circuit</a> is one of their most popular options. It comes with a small and simple frame, to keep weight to a minimum, and plenty of storage space for those larger backpacking or hiking trips. Features like hip belt pockets are a definite bonus for backpackers who don't want to stop just to get a snack from their food bag in the main pocket. And it weighs less than just about anything else you'll find. They're also a company that manufacturers everything right in the USA.</li>

The two most popular are canister stoves, which work with propane canisters, and liquid fuel stoves, which work with a variety of different fuels. But there are a few other alternative fuel stoves, like a <strong>wood burning backpacking stove</strong>, for instance. The great thing about a wood stove, of course, is that your fuel is waiting for you at your campsite already, so there’s no need to carry it with you.
<h2>Wood Burning Backpacking Stove</h2>
What to look at when shopping for a wood burning backpacking stove.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – One of the great things about wood stoves, as pointed out above, is that you don’t have to bring your fuel with you, fuel often being the heavier piece of the stove set up. But even amongst wood burning backpacking stoves there are some drastic differences in the weight, which can be from a wide variety of features and variables.</li>
	<li><strong>Alternative Fuels</strong> – Sometimes you don’t have the option of wood. Maybe you’re camping somewhere where <!--more-->there is a wood fire ban, for instance, or where there just isn’t any wood around to burn. In that case, it can be helpful to have a wood stove that can also burn other fuels, like alcohol or esbit tablets.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Wood Burning Backpacking Stove</h2>
Some of the very best choices when it comes to a wood burning backpacking stove.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/junior-stove\">Littlebug Junior Stove</a> - This is a little <strong>stainless steel model</strong> that will work very well as a wood burning stove. It <strong>also burns alcohol</strong>, so you do have some alternatives if wood isn't an option. Since it's stainless steel it does weigh a bit more than it otherwise would, but at <strong>5.1 ounces, or 144 grams</strong>, it's not exactly heavy, especially when you remember that you're not carrying any heavy fuel with you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/829302/vargo-titanium-hexagon-backpacking-wood-stove\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon Stove</a> - The Hexagon is a straight wood stove. It's really <strong>just a hexagon made from titanium</strong>, though there is definitely more to it than that. The <strong>side are all slanted slightly inwards towards the top, for instance, so that the heat is concentrated towards the bottom of your pot</strong>, giving you as much heat as possible. The whole thing will also fold down so that it's easy to pack up when not in use. It also <strong>weighs just 4.1 ounces, or 116 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/evernew-titanium-dx-stove-set\">Evernew Titanium DX Stove</a> - The DX has a design very similar to the Junior from Littlebug above. It burns wood, but like the Littlebug it <strong>will also burn alcohol</strong>, making it a more versatile choice than something like the wood stove from Vargo. Unlike the Littlebug stove this one from Evernew is <strong>made from titanium</strong>, which helps keep the weight down to a very respectable <strong>4 ounces, or 113 grams</strong>. So a lightweight and versatile wood burning backpacking stove.</li>

But some headlamps can get rather heavy, and when weight is a concern, as it is when backpacking, for instance, <strong>ultralight headlamps</strong> are worth considering, to help you save on weight. Fortunately, headlamp technology has come a long way, and you don’t need to make too many sacrifices to get a headlamp that wont weigh much.
<h2>Ultralight Headlamps</h2>
What to look for when reviewing ultralight headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – The more light your headlamp can put out, the heavier your headlamp is going to be, all other things being equal. So while you might need a certain amount of light for whatever you’re doing, you should also not get a headlamp that has a unnecessarily high power output, if you want an ultralight headlamp.</li>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – Some headlamps come packed with a lot of extras that you might not need. For instance, you might want to try and avoid headlamps with a top strap, because that strap weighs something, and is usually indicative of a <!--more-->headlamp that weighs enough to need that strap. You might also want to avoid headlamps with features like an external battery pack.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Headlamps</h2>
Some of the very best choices for ultralight headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796823/surefire-saint-minimus-led-headlamp\">SureFire Saint Minimus</a> - The Minimus is a great little headlamp. It weighs in at 3.3 ounces, which is 93 grams, and that's with the battery. What makes the Minimus unique is that it's just one LED, but it has a dimmer switch, so you start out with a maximum of <strong>100 lumens, and then can dim the light down</strong> to anything below that, depending on what your needs are. On the lowest settings you will get about 50 hours of battey life, while on 100 it's quite a bit less. So a unique and ultralight headlamp.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lucido-s-lite\">Mammut Lucido S-Lite</a> - The S-Lite is a great example of minimalism in design. It has three different LEDs, each of which offers 3 different amounts of light. The <strong>maximum is just 20 lumens</strong>, which isn't super bright, but it's <strong>enough to see about 60 feet</strong>, which is  enough for most people. It will last about about <strong>60 hours on a single AA battery</strong> on the lowest power setting, and weighs in at just <strong>1.7 ounces, or 48 grams</strong> with the battery.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-zipka-plus-2-headlamp\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2</a> - The Zipka is a very popular ultralight headlamp. It has a <strong>retracting headband</strong>, so it's tiny enough to fit in to a pocket when not in use. And despite being just <strong>2.5 ounces, or 70 grams</strong> with battery it gives you <strong>70 lumens</strong> to work with, and a very <strong>impressive 150 hours of battery life</strong> on the lowest setting, which is a red LED that will save your night vision. So a solid, feature rich ultralight headlamp.</li>

A big, well insulated coffee mug isn’t really an option when you’re camping, and you have to make do with a better, more purpose built <strong>camping coffee mug</strong>. Still, there are some excellent options when it comes to camping coffee mugs that wont leave you with burnt fingers or cold coffee. And they will work fine for any other beverage as well.
<h2>Camping Coffee Mug</h2>
What to look for from a camping coffee mug.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Double Walled</strong> – One feature to definitely consider when buying a camping coffee mug is a double walled cup. The double walled construction insulates your fingers from the hot coffee, and the hot coffee from the cold air. That way, your coffee stays hot and you don’t burn your fingers on your coffee mug.</li>
	<li><strong>Handle</strong> – Even with a double walled construction the outside of your camping coffee mug might be too hot to hold, and so a handle is a necessary feature. Just be sure to get a handle<!--more--> that folds down in some way, otherwise your camping coffee mug will be even more awkward to pack without wasting a lot of space.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Coffee Mug</h2>
Some of the best choices when you're in the market for a camping coffee mug.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/659999/snow-peak-titanium-double-wall-cup\">Snow Peak Titanium Double Wall Cup</a> - It's not cheap, but if you want the best for sipping coffee in the outdoors, this is it. It's <strong>titanium, with a double walled design</strong>, which helps to insulate the coffee while keeping too much heat from reaching your fingers. It also has <strong>a handle that will collapse down</strong> when you're not using it, for the easiest possible storage.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-x-mug-collapsible-mug\">Sea to Summit X-Mug Collapsible Mug</a> - This is a <strong>collapsing mug made from silicon</strong>. It actually <strong>collapses down accordion style in to a flat disk</strong>, which makes it nice and easy to store in your backpack. It's not double walled, of course, and there's also no handle, so you will want to let your coffee cool a bit, probably, before handling the mug. It <strong>holds .47 liters</strong>, however, and <strong>weighs just 2.7 ounces, or 76 grams</strong>, which is a great weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/aluminum-mug\">Esbit Aluminum Mug</a> - Another solid mug, this one <strong>made from aluminum</strong>. The main benefit of aluminum is that it's lightweight, and at <strong>just 2.8 ounces, or 79 grams</strong> this is another extremely lightweight camping coffee mug to take in to the outdoors. It has a <strong>capacity of .35 liters</strong>, so not the biggest mug, and while it does have a handle, it's not the kind that folds down.</li>

Having a good sleeping bag is important for getting a good night's sleep, as is a good sleeping pad. But having a sleeping bag and a sleeping pad that work together to keep you warm is better.
<h2>Sleeping Bag Quilts</h2>
Sleeping bag quilts are a great example of this in action (<a href=\"http://www.nunatakusa.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nunatak</a> is a great sleeping bag quilt manufacturer). Sleeping bag quilts, for those not in the know, have an enclosed footbox, to keep your feet warm, and then open up on the bottom of the bag as it goes up your body. The justification for this design is that sleeping bags keep you warm through the loft created by the insulation. Any insulation under you is being wasted, because it is being crushed down. So why not remove it and save the weight?

Of course when you remove that extra material you are then sleeping right on top of the sleeping pad, which is where it helps to have a good sleeping pad.

An important metric, when looking at sleeping pads, is their R-value. <!--more-->This is a measurement of how warm the sleeping pad is.  A sleeping pad with a high R-value will better reflect your body heat. The thing is, you actually lose a lot of heat out of the bottom of your body when you sleep. This is the reason that hammock sleepers tend to put something under them when the sleep. If they don't, all that body heat leaks out in to the open space below them.
<h2>Sleeping Bags for Restless Sleepers</h2>
So a nice, warm sleeping pad is great when you have a quilt, but even with a more traditional sleeping bag, a good sleeping pad can really pay off. Side sleepers, for instance, or those who like to move around a lot, will benefit from a looser sleeping bag and a wider, usually rectangular shaped sleeping pad.

I personally am a side sleeper who likes to move around a lot, and my mummy-shaped sleeping pad is not enough sleeping pad to keep me off the ground at night.
<h2>Winter Sleeping Bags</h2>
Of course the season that you are planning to sleep out in is important too. If you wanted to go winter camping, for instance, but did not have a sleeping bag that measured up to the winter temperatures that you were expecting, you could help to warm yourself up with a good sleeping pad.

Going back to the R-value discussion above, it would be easy enough to get a sleeping pad with a very high R-value. Exped, for instance, makes a really great one called the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780365/exped-downmat-9-sleeping-pad-with-pump\" rel=\"nofollow\">Downmat 9</a>.

The high sleeping pad R-value will increase the warmth you get from your sleeping pad, and will supplement the heat from your sleeping bag.

So if you are thinking of picking up a new sleeping bag, sleeping pad or both in the near future, try and think about how you can get your sleeping bag and sleeping pad to work together for you.

The thinner a down jacket is, of course, the colder it will be. So if you don’t need to stay extremely warm a thin down jacket is a good idea. But thinner down jackets will also weigh less, which is a definite plus for backpackers, hikers and other outdoor enthusiasts. A thin down jacket will also be more compact and compressible, another feature that backpacker, hikers and the like will appreciate.
<h2>Thin Down Jacket</h2>
What to look for form a thin down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – If you’re going to get a thin down jacket it will help to get a down jacket filled with high quality down, like 900+ fill down, rather than lower quality down, like 700+ fill down. The higher quality stuff will compress down better and weigh less, while providing the same amount of warmth.</li>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Regardless of how thick or thin your down jacket is, it’s a good idea to get one that is water resistant on the outside. That way, the down inside stays dry, and does <!--more-->not clump, because down that is clumped will not keep you very warm, at least not until you dry it out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Thin Down Jacket</h2>
Some of the very best thin down jackets for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-mens\">Mont Bell EX Light Down Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-ex-light-down-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The EX Light is one of, if not the best thin down jacket around, for the simple reason that it uses very <strong>high quality 900+ fill down</strong>, so that it's thin, lightweight and also warm. In fact The EX Light <strong>doesn't have a hood or even hand pockets</strong>, which is all to decrease the weight as much as possible. And at <strong>5.7 ounces, or 161 grams</strong>, you're unlikely to find a lighter down jacket. It's also water resistant.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/microlight-alpine-jacket-men-s\">Rab Microlight Alpine Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/microlight-alpine-jacket-women-s\">Women's</a>) - The Microlight is another fairly thin down jacket, meant for staying active in the outdoors and layering when things get really cold. It uses <strong>750+ fill down</strong>, which isn't the highest quality, but does help to keep the price down. It also comes with <strong>a hood, a water resistant exterior and a couple of hand warmer pockets</strong>, plus one chest pocket, so that you have plenty of options for keeping those extremities warm in cold temperatures. So an excellent down jacket for staying warm while staying active. It <strong>weighs 12.3 ounces, or 350 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815694/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoodie-jacket-mens\">Patagonia Ultralight Down Hoodie Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815832/patagonia-ultralight-down-hoody-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - This offering from Patagonia is fairly similar to the Rab down jacket above. It comes with <strong>a hood, plus a couple of hand warmer pockets and one zippered pocket on your chest</strong> for storing a few essentials. It <strong>uses 800+ fill down</strong>, and a water resistant exterior to keep you and the down inside dry. Overall it has a <strong>low profile and a close fit</strong>, to keep you as warm as possible. The whole thing weighs <strong>9 ounces, or 255 grams</strong>.</li>

<h2>Water Filters for Hiking</h2>
What to look for when you want water filter for hiking.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Per Minute</strong> – Some filters will process water quite a bit faster than others, and unless you want to be sitting there, pumping away for a long time, it helps to pay attention to just how fast your water filter will pump water out. That way, you don’t exhaust yourself pumping your water filter.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter Life</strong> – Each filter will last a certain amount of time before it needs to be replaced. Most go for somewhere between 1000 and 2000 liters of water, which is quite a bit, but<!--more--> others will go for less, or even more. If you use your water filter a lot, it’s a number worth paying attention to.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Filters for Hiking</h2>
Some of the very best water filters for hiking with.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/platypus-gravityworks-filter-and-purifier-system\">Platypus GravityWorks Filter</a> - The GravityWorks <strong>uses gravity, rather than your pumping</strong>, to get the filtering done, which is definitely a nice touch. It also puts out an <strong>impressive 1.75 liters of water per minutes</strong>, which is more than you'll get with just about any pump filter. And the<strong> filter will go for 1501 liters of water</strong>. How it works is there's two bags, and you hang the bag with the dirty water above the one with the clean water. Gravity does the rest. You can even hook up other platypus containers, like water bottles, to the output. So a fantastic, if a bit unwieldy option. The whole thing <strong>weighs 10.7 ounces, which is 305 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/695265/msr-miniworks-ex-water-filter\">MSR MiniWorks EX Filter</a> - The MiniWorks is a solid, if slightly heavy water filter from MSR. It only <strong>pumps out water at approximately .83 liters per minute</strong>, which is not exactly impressive. But the<strong> filter will go for a full 2000 liters</strong>, which is plenty for most people. The output will also made to work with other MSR products, as well as a few more popular water bottles, like the Nalgene bottles,though it will also work with anything else too. But a <strong>weight of 14.6 ounces, which is 416 grams</strong> will definitely not appeal to those concerned about weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hiker-pro-microfilter\">Katadyn Hiker PRO Microfilter</a> - Another <strong>pump filter</strong>, this one a popular choice with hikers and backpackers. It will give you a solid <strong>1 liter of water per minute</strong>, though the <strong>filter needs to be replaced every 750 liters of water</strong>, which is probably the biggest weakness here. Still, at <strong>11 ounces, which is 310 grams</strong> it's a good, lightweight water filter for hiking with.</li>

Fortunately, there are some excellent <strong>water hiking shoes</strong> that have enough ventilation that you can walk through the water and while your feet will get wet, they will also dry fast. They’re not quite sandals, but they’re also not hiking shoes, they fall somewhere in between those two.
<h2>Water Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when reviewing water hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sandal or Shoe</strong> – If you’re looking for water hiking shoes, what you might really be looking for is a pair of hiking sandals. Water hiking shoes have more of a shoe upper, just with chunks removed, while hiking sandals have just straps to secure your foot to the sandal, and not much else to shield your feet from the elements.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – As with any shoe, weight matters. Big, heavy hiking shoes will sap your energy, because it <!--more-->really does take a lot of energy to move your legs back and forth all day. So do yourself a favor and go with a pair of lightweight water hiking shoes, rather than dragging around two big heavy hiking shoes all day long.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Water Hiking Shoes</h2>
Some of the best water hiking shoes for hiking in.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798244/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-mens\">Vibram FiveFingers Sprint</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798168/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - First up, the very popular Vibram FiveFingers, which are ideal for when you're in and out of the water on a regular basis. These <strong>particular version of the popular toe shoes are open on top</strong>, so that your feet have every chance to dry quickly when you exit the water. They also have <strong>an anti-bacterial treatment</strong>, which is nice since they're quite close fitting. Of course like all of Vibram's FiveFingers they're <strong>quite thin on the bottom, and don't offer much in the way of support</strong>, so it's recommended that you give your feet a chance to adapt to them.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-newport-h2-sandal-mens\">Keen NewPort H2 Sandals</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/keen-newport-h2-sandal-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Newport H2s are a bit <strong>like a shoe that has had large chunks of the upper cut out of it</strong>. It has a <strong>rudimentary lacing system, plus a sturdy Vibram sole</strong>. That said, it does also have plenty of ventilation, which means your feet wont be stuffed in to a tight, damp and warm place when you get out of the water. So a more traditional option for water hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/z2-unaweep-sandal-men-s\">Chaco ZX2 Unaweep Sandals</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/zx2-unaweep-sandal-women-s\">Women's</a>) - These are <strong>much more like a sandal</strong>. Whereas the Newports above have most of the upper intact, these are just a few straps holding your foot in place. So like any pair of sandals you don't have to worry in the least about your feet getting wet. Unlike your average pair of sandals, however, these <strong>come with a solid Vibram sole</strong>, so you wont have to worry about a lack of good traction on the hiking trail. So a good option if you would prefer something like to a sandal for your water hiking shoes.</li>

You don’t need anything fancy, as long as you are just doing some casual camping, but if you’re going to be carrying your large family tent for any length of time, you’re better off with two smaller tents. Large tents tend to be rather heavy, heavier than the combined weight of two smaller tents is generally going to be, unless you choose particularly heavy smaller tents.
<h2>Large Family Tents</h2>
What to look at when reviewing large family tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Partitions and Doors</strong> – With a large group sleeping on close proximity, things like noise and midnight trips to the bathroom are going to wake people up. But with partition walls to keep noise down, for example, and multiple doors to allow people easy entry and exit, everyone can get a good night of sleep without too many interruptions.</li>
	<li><strong>Capacity</strong> – Large family tents, obviously, come in a few different sizes, depending on exactly how big your family is. But not all 6 man tents, for instance, will be the same size, so beyond the official capacity, it can be useful to<!--more--> compare the floor space of different tents, so that you know how much space you’re getting.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Large Family Tents</h2>
Some of the very best large family tents for getting everyone under one roof.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-4-tent-4-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 4</a> - If you can squeeze the whole large family in to a <strong>4 person tent</strong>, then the Fly Creek UL4 is an ideal choice. It's a backpacking tent, meaning that it's <strong>lightweight and easy to carry</strong>, which is never a bad thing when backpacking. More specifically, it <strong>weighs 4 pounds 1 ounce, or 1.84 kilograms</strong>. Of course it takes superior construction and materials to get the weight down that low, so it's no the cheapest tent. But if you have to carry a tent, you're best served by a lightweight tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-halo-6-person-tent\">Marmot Halo 6</a> - The Halo is more of a <strong>reasonably priced camping tent</strong>, with room inside for 6. It also <strong>2 doors</strong>, along with <strong>2 large vestibules</strong> so that you can easily get your gear out the weather at night. It also has a total of 100 square feet of floor space, which is plenty of <strong>room for 6 people</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 19 pounds 7 ounces, or 8.81 kilograms</strong>, however, so definitely not a tent you would want to have to carry in a backpack, but a good choice for a little recreational family camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810168/rei-kingdom-8-tent-2012\">REI Kingdom 8</a> - This is a big, sturdy camping tent with <strong>room for 8 inside</strong>. It features a <strong>dividing wall to separate it in to two rooms, plus a door for each room</strong>, though only one side has a true vestibule. It's also a rectangular design, so easy to lay everyone out inside. The whole thing <strong>weighs 19 pounds 14 ounces, which is 9.02 kilograms</strong>, so again not the kind of tent that you would want to carry very far in a backpack. But the price is definitely right for a large family camping tent.</li>

<h2>Light Hiking Shoes</h2>
What to look for when you want light hiking shoes for your feet.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathable</strong> – On the choice of whether to go with waterproof hiking shoes or breathable hiking shoes, the best choice, as far as weight is concerned, is breathable. In theory, the more breathable your hiking shoes are the less material there is, so the most breathable hiking shoes will also be the lightest hiking shoes.</li>
	<li><strong>Proprioception</strong> – Proprcioception is your ability to sense the environment around you. With regards to hiking shoes, it’s the ability to sense what’s underfoot, which can actually<!--more--> improve your hiking, by reducing injuries, for instance. Eliminating all of the excess material between you and the ground also helps to save on weight.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Light Hiking Shoes</h2>
A few of the best light hiking shoes for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/f-lite-195-trail-running-shoe-unisex\">Inov8 F-Lite 195 Trail Running Shoes</a> - These are an excellent pair of <strong>very light unisex hiking or trail running shoes</strong> from UK manufacturer Inov8. The weight of Inov8's shoes is so important that they actually put it right in the name. These <strong>weigh 195 grams, or 6.8 ounces</strong>, which makes them almost absurdly lightweight. They're nothing but mesh on top, and have a <strong>very thin, minimalist sole</strong> that wont offer much padding with the ground. But you also wont find many pairs of shoes lighter than these from Inov8.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805275/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-mens\">Vibram FiveFingers TrekSport Multisport Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804306/vibram-fivefingers-treksport-multisport-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - Vibram's FiveFingers <strong>toe shoes</strong> might seem gimmicky, but many people swear by them, and they're minimalist design lends itself well to a low weight. These actually have a <strong>slightly thicker sole than some other pairs of FiveFingers, and some grip on the bottom too for uneven trails</strong>. But even with these extras the TrekSports manage to <strong>weigh just 12.4 ounces, or 351 grams</strong>, which is very respectable compared to most hiking shoes. So a good choice if you like the Vibram FiveFinger design.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/new-balance-mt10-minimus-trail-running-shoe-mens\">New BalanceMT10 Minimus Trail Running Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/new-balance-wt10-minimus-trail-running-shoe-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Minimus shoes are another pair with a <strong>minimalist design and a thin sole</strong>, which lends itself well to a low weight. They're mesh on top, so they will breath very well, and have a <strong>solid Vibram sole</strong>, so you don't have  to worry about sliding around on less than stellar trails. They even have an <strong>anti-microbial treatment</strong> to keep smells to a minimum. They <strong>weigh 14.2 ounces, which is 402 grams</strong>, making them the heaviest pair of hiking shoes on this list, but still a light hiking shoe compared to the average pair.</li>

If you just want something to get you through dusk, for instance, then you don’t need anything too fancy, but if you’re going to be hiking straight through the night, you might want something a little more powerful to help light the way.
<h2>Best Hiking Headlamp</h2>
What to look at when you want the best hiking headlamp.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Power Range</strong> – As alluded to above, the amount of light that you need may change. And so it helps if you can change the amount of light that your headlamp produces, so that you get lots of light when you’re moving fast at night, and low light when you’re not doing much and are looking to save power.</li>
	<li><strong>Red Light</strong> – One thing that you might want when hiking with a headlamp is the ability to produce red light. Red light doesn’t dilate your pupils, so when you turn the headlamp off you’re not <!--more-->temporarily blind. It’s an ideal power setting for when you just need the headlamp for a minute or two, and don’t want to have to wait for your eyes to readjust.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Headlamp Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a few of the best hiking headlamps on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - The Ultra is the best hiking headlamp for one thing, and that is when you are moving fast and need lots of brightness. With <strong>350 lumens at your disposal</strong> on the highest power setting you will never be without enough light. The downside is that this headlamp <strong>doesn't have any low power LEDs</strong>, so even on the lowest power setting you still run out of battery power rather quickly - 17 hours to be precise. So built for brightness and not much else. The <strong>battery is rechargeable</strong>, however, which is definitely nice. It's also not the lightest headlamp, at <strong>12.1 ounces, which is 346 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus Headlamp</a> - The Tactikka is at the other end of the spectrum from the Ultra, with just <strong>35 lumens</strong> available on the highest power setting. So not much. But that's balanced out by a<strong> total of 150 hours of battery life</strong>, which is certainly better than the Ultra's 17. And even on the Tactikka's highest power setting, you still get an impressive 100 hours of battery life. And all that in a <strong>2.75 ounce, or 78 gram package</strong>. It even has a <strong>small little red lens</strong> that you can flip down over the white LEDs, for a red light mode.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm</a> - The Storm is a solid, durable headlamp meant for abuse. <strong>For starters it's waterproof</strong>, which most headlamps cant claim to be. It will give you <strong>100 lumens of light</strong> to work with on the highest power setting, which is plenty to see far with, and on the lowest power setting you get a total of <strong>200 hours of battery life</strong>. That lowest setting is a red light setting that comes from the 2 red LEDs built in. So a solid headlamp with plenty of options. It <strong>weighs 3.9 ounces, which is 110 grams</strong>.</li>

So while an <strong>850 down jacket</strong> is not the absolute highest quality, it is a very high number, and will do an excellent job of keeping you warm. But as with any down jacket, there are a few things you need to keep in mind when buying an 850+ fill down jacket.
<h2>850 Down Jacket</h2>
What look for in an 850 fill down jacket.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Down, regardless of its quality, is susceptible to getting wet. And when it gets wet it clumps together, and when that happens it stops insulating you, and keeping you warm. So a down jacket with a water resistant exterior will keep the down inside dry, which will in turn keep you warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – One other thing to consider when getting a down jacket, regardless of the quality of the down, is a good. Hoods are often used to keep your head dry, which you wont want <!--more-->to do with a down jacket, but a hood will also keep your head warm, something that a hooded down jacket will do very well.</li>

<ul>

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-ultralight-java-drip\">GSI Outdoors Ultralight Java Drip</a> - First up, a very good and basic drip filter from GSI.

But there are a wide variety of choices when it comes to trail hiking shoes, and you will need to make a few decisions on just what you want your trail hiking shoes to be able to do. Above all else, however, your trail hiking shoes should be comfortable, and shouldn’t cause you any foot problems which might ruin the trail hiking experience.
<h2>Trail Hiking Shoes</h2>
Things to look for when reviewing trail hiking shoes.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – Heavy trail hiking shoes will tire you out, while lightweight hiking shoes will leave you with a lot more energy at the end of the day. It’s nothing that you will notice right away, but over the course of an entire day of hiking you might take thousands of steps, and the weight of your shoes really does add up over those thousands of steps.</li>
	<li><strong>Breathable</strong> – For most hiking, you want a pair of hiking shoes that is breathable. Sweaty feet can lead to a lot of foot problems, and while waterproof shoes are good for keeping water out, a lot of the moisture that causes people <!--more-->to develop foot problems is generated from feet that are stifled inside shoes that don’t breath.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Trail Hiking Shoes</h2>
Some of the best trail hiking shoes for men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/f-lite-230-trail-running-shoe-unisex\">Inov8 F-Lite 230 Trail Running Shoes</a> - If you prefer your trail hiking shoes<strong> small, minimalist and very breathable</strong>, the F-Lite 230s are for you. At <strong>just 8.1 ounces, or 230 grams</strong> it will seem like you're hardly even wearing anything on your feet. The<strong> sole is sticky rubber</strong>, ideal for bad terrain, though there really isn't much material between you and the ground with these hiking shoes, so you will feel the pointier sticks and rocks. Still, if you want lightweight, you cant have as much padding. They're also unisex.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/811478/the-north-face-hedgehog-iii-gtx-xcr-hiking-shoes-mens\">The North Face Hedgehog III GTX XCR Hiking Shoes</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/836244/the-north-face-hedgehog-gtx-xcr-iii-hiking-shoes-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Hedgehogs are <strong>big, well padded hiking shoe</strong>. They come with a <strong>Gore Tex XCR liner</strong> to keep your feet dry, and a mesh exterior to allow for plenty of ventilation, which helps the Gore Tex to do it's job. They also feature a Vibram sole. At <strong>1 pound 12.5 ounces, or 807 grams</strong> you're definitely going to know you're wearing them, but plenty of padding and a waterproof liner is going to add weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montrail-mountain-masochist-ii-trail-running-shoe-mens\">Montrail Mountain Masochist II</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montrail-mountain-masochist-ii-trail-running-shoe-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Mountain Masochists are ideal if you want a <strong>basic but solid pair of trail hiking shoes that will breath well</strong>. They're low and have a fairly minimal design, but are sturdier than the F-Lite 230s above, at <strong>21.6 ounces, or 612 grams for the pair</strong>. The upper is mesh, so again they will ventilate very well, which is great in the summer heat when the last thing you're worried about is rain or puddles.</li>

A survival kit will help you survive, but unless you have something like a GPS personal locator beacon, chances are no one is going to be coming to your rescue. Still, most people will never use their GPS personal locator beacon, but then a big part of why a person buys something like this is for the peace of mind it provides both them and their family and friends back home.
<h2>GPS Personal Locator Beacon</h2>
What to look for when you want a GPS Personal locator beacon.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Test Mode</strong> – Most GPS personal locator beacons are extremely well made pieces of technology that you can depend on. But even the most durable of technology does occasionally fail, which is why it is helpful to have a test mode on your personal locator beacon, so that you can make sure it’s functioning properly before you go and depend on it.</li>
	<li><strong>I’m OK</strong> – Many of the higher end GPS personal locator beacons will give you the ability to send an “I’m OK” message. Part of the reason people buy a personal locator beacon, after all, is peace of mind, and so <!--more-->the ability to send a message telling friends and family that you’re ok helps to give them that peace of mind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best GPS Personal Locator Beacon</h2>
Some of the best GPS personal locator beacons for when you get well and truly lost.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gps-satellite-messenger\">SPOT GPS Satellite Messenger</a> - First up, the cheapest option on the list, from SPOT. The low price, however, is offset by what you might consider to be the greatest flaw of this device, which is that you need to subscribe to SPOT's service if you expect the device to work. So over the years, the <strong>$99 per year fee</strong> will add up, whereas with most other GPS locators, all your costs are up front. But <strong>it's small, lightweight, at just 5.2 ounces, or 147 grams, and will send \"I'm OK\" messages, along with GPS data</strong>, so it will likely appeal to some people.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791972/mcmurdo-fast-find-210-personal-locator-beacon-with-gps\">McMurdo Fast Find 210 Personal Locator Beacon with GPS</a> - Another <strong>relatively cheap GPS personal locator beacon</strong>, this time from McMurdo. You cant send any \"I'm OK\" messages with the Fast Find, but <strong>you can test the device</strong>, which is certainly a nice feature to have. And like most other personal locator beacons, it uses the Search and Rescue satellite, which <strong>doesn't require any sort of subscription to use</strong>, so after you buy the unit you don't need to pay anything else. It <strong>weighs 5.3 ounces, or 150 grams</strong>, which is just slightly more than the SPOT above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/acr-sarlink-view-406-personal-locator-beacon\">ACR SARLink View 406 GPS Personal Locator Beacon</a> - The View 406 is a more feature rich personal locator beacon that has a cost that reflects the extras. For starters, it uses the same basic Search and Rescue satellite, so there <strong>are no subscription fees</strong>. You can also <strong>send \"I'm OK\" messages, along with GPS data</strong>, so that loved ones have a good idea where you are. There's <strong>also a test mode</strong>, so that you know it's working properly before you leave the house. But it's features like a strobe light that get's automatically activated that are what set the View 406 apart. The whole thing does weigh slightly more than the other options, however, at <strong>8.9 ounces, or 258 grams</strong>.</li>

As with most backpacking gear the big thing that you will want from a pair of <strong>backpacking gaiters</strong> is versatility. You need gaiters that will keep water out, but also breath well, and most importantly of all, be durable enough to go for consecutive days of hard use without falling apart. Backpacking is hard work, after all, and there’s no room for poorly made gear that will just fall apart after a little wear and tear.
<h2>Backpacking Gaiters</h2>
What to look for from backpacking gaiters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – Waterproof gaiters are definitely an option, but backpacking is hard work, and gaiters that are breathable are likely equally as important, if not more so. Keeping water out of your boots is one thing, but if your feet and socks are soaked in sweat, you haven’t really accomplished much.</li>
	<li><strong>Replaceable Strap</strong> – Many gaiters give you the ability to replace the strap that goes underneath your boot, and helps hold the gaiters in place. Backpackers, especially those <!--more-->that put in a lot of miles, will wear that strap out relatively quickly, and it helps if you can replace it when it does eventually wear thin.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacking Gaiters</h2>
Some of the very best options for backpacking gaiters, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/725915/outdoor-research-crocodile-gaiters\">Outdoor Research Crocodile Gaiters</a> - If you would prefer a pair of <strong>big, beefy mountain gaiters</strong> to take backpacking, then these are your best choice. They've been around since at least 1999, which is when they <strong>won the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Gold award</strong>. They're <strong>heavy 3 layer Gore Tex on the top portion</strong>, to ensure that your feet don't get wet from rain or snow, and then <strong>1000D cordura nylon on the bottom</strong> portion, for long lasting durability from things like boot rub. A tough, durable waterproof pair of backpacking gaiters. They <strong>weigh 10.2 ounces, or 289 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hispar-gaiter\">Rab Hispar Gaiters</a> - These are another pair of <strong>full length gaiters, but with a much lighter, more breathable construction</strong>. They're made with <strong>3 layer eVent on the top portion</strong>, eVent being a waterproof but also very breathable fabric. The <strong>bottom section is 600D ballistic polyester</strong>, which is tough, but not as heavy as the 1000D nylon on the Crocodiles above. They're also quite a bit cheaper than the Crocodiles, which will likely appeal to many people. So another pair of full length waterproof gaiters for backpacking, but with a much lighter, more breathable design. Unfortunately there's no exact weight given for them.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/outdoor-research-rocky-mountain-low-gaiter\">Outdoor Research Rocky Mountain Low Gaiters</a> - If you would prefer a pair of <strong>ankle gaiters</strong> to take backpacking then the Rocky Mountain gaiters from Outdoor Research are an excellent choice. They're <strong>made with nylon packcloth that has a durable water repellent finish</strong>, so they're water resistant, rather than fully waterproof. The good news about that is that they're far more breathable, and thus a better option for better weather, where rain is a possibility, rather than an inevitability. The pair <strong>weighs just 4.3 ounces, or 121 grams</strong>.</li>

Something from the cupboard at home will hold your food well enough, but purpose built camping plates do a much better job of holding your food so that you can stuff it all down. And if you need more than one plate, and maybe some bowls or cups to do with them, then a <strong>camping plates set</strong> is what you need. Buying in bulk, after all, is almost always more efficient than buying single pieces.
<h2>Camping Plates Set</h2>
What to look for when buying a whole camping plate set.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – The material that you choose to go with is the most important variable when it comes to picking out camping plates. There is metal, plastic and a few other choices too. There are also a few different kinds of metal, each with positives and negatives. It helps to do your research, so that you know what your options are.</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – When buying camping plates it helps to make sure that the plates are big enough. You might also want <!--more-->to look in to camping plates that have high sides. That way, when you’re eating something a little more sloppy, like pasta with extra sauce, you don’t end up with pasta and sauce on you and the ground below you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Plates Set</h2>
Some of the best choices for a camping plate set.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gsi-outdoors-gourmet-plate-set\">GSI Outdoors Gourmet Plate Set</a> - This set from GSI Outdoors is<strong> just 4 plates</strong>, and is ideal if all you need is plates, and you already have everything else. The plates themselves are <strong>made with polypropylene</strong>, and have a <strong>7.5 inch diameter</strong> with high sides to that there wont be any spills. The whole set weighs just <strong>5 ounces, or 141 grams</strong>, which is a good weight. So a camping plate set for four, assuming that all you need is plates.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799278/rei-campware-group-tableware-set\">REI Campware Group Tableware Set</a> - This campware set from REI is <strong>plates, along with cups and bowls</strong>. There's <strong>4 of each</strong>, for a total of 12 items in the set. Everything is <strong>made from polypropylene</strong> like the GSI plates above, though these are square, rather than round, and with relatively high sides so you wont lose any food eating on uneven surfaces. Thole thing <strong>weighs 31.5 ounces, or 893 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/personal-cooker-3-6pc\">Snow Peak Personal Cooker 3</a> - This is another kind of set from Snow Peak. It's a <strong>set of 2 pots of varying size, plus a frying pan</strong>, each of which has folding handles and is made from stainless steel. It <strong>also comes with 2 plates that likely double as lids for the pots, and a bowl</strong>. So a bit of an oddball collection, but if you don't mind your plates being different sizes, and need pots and pans, then this might be the ideal camping plate set for you.</li>

What you need is a <strong>portable camping hammock</strong> that will be lightweight and small, yet will carry your weight and be versatile enough to set up in a variety of different environments. You will likely also want a few things to go along with your portable camping hammock, to make sure you get a good night of sleep.
<h2>Portable Camping Hammock</h2>
What to look for when you want a portable camping hammock.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tarp</strong> – The hammock will make sure that you have a comfortable sleep while out there in the woods, but if it starts raining you’re definitely not going to be very comfortable. Which is why it helps if you get a portable camping hammock that comes with a tarp that you can set up over top of you, to keep you both comfortable and dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Hanging System</strong> – Another important additional piece of the puzzle that you will need for your portable camping hammock is a system to attach the hammock to the trees or whatever else you end up using. Some hammocks come with<!--more--> this, but some don’t, so make sure that you get some sort of hanging system if you don’t already have it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Portable Camping Hammock</h2>
Some of the very best portable camping hammocks for your next camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/eagles-nest-outfitters-singlenest-hammock\">Eagles Nest Outfitters SingleNest Hammock</a> - The SingleNest is an ideal camping hammock, especially for those larger individuals, as the SingleNest will <strong>hold a total of 400 pounds</strong>, whereas most other hammocks will only hold something like 250 pounds. What the SingleNest lacks, however, is just about everything else, including a tarp, a mosquito net and even ropes for hanging. So a good camping hammock if you already have the other gear necessary, or are looking to customize. It <strong>weighs 18 ounces, which is 510 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721900/hennessy-hammock-explorer-ultralight-asym-classic-hammock\">Hennessy Hammock Explorer Ultralight Asym Classic Hammock</a> - The Explorer is everything you need to go hammock camping. The hammock itself <strong>will carry 250 pounds</strong>, but also comes with a <strong>mosquito net built in</strong>. There's also a <strong>tarp included, as well as ropes for hanging the hammock</strong> in a suitable spot. So it's a more expensive option than the other hammocks listed, and also heavier, at <strong>2 pounds 7 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong> for the whole thing, but an excellent option if you want everything you'll need for hammock camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/moskito-traveller-hammock\">Byer of Maine Moskito Traveller Hammock</a> - Another good hammock for taking camping, this one <strong>with a built in mosquito net</strong>, so that you wont be bothered by the  bugs while you're in the outdoors. It doesn't come with a tarp, however, and also does not come with a hanging system, though Byer of Maine recommends their <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/721723/byer-amazonas-microrope\">MicroRopes</a>. The hammock has a <strong>maximum weight capacity of 250 pounds</strong>, which is fairly standard, and <strong>weighs 1 pound, which is 453 grams</strong>. So a good portable camping hammock, as long as you're not worried about rain.</li>

It’s enough people that you are having fun with friends, but not so many that you are overwhelmed by the logistics of too many people. There are, for example, plenty of <strong>4 person tents</strong> to choose from, and you wont have any trouble finding the perfect 4 person tent for you. So many choices, however, necessitates that you first figure out what you want from your tent.
<h2>4 Person Tents</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing 4 person tents.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – A 4 person tent is going to have on the heavy side, so you will likely want to pay close attention to the weight of your 4 person tent, especially if you’re unlucky enough to be the person who gets to carry it. There are certain features, like a single wall design for example, that will lower a tent’s weight quite a bit.</li>
	<li><strong>Floor Space</strong> – Not all 4 person tents are created equal. You might find one tent cramped with all four of you in it, while another feels quite roomy. So if you want to know just how<!--more--> big your tent is going to be, it’s a good idea to compare the floor sizes of tents, so you know what to expect from your tent.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 4 Person Tents</h2>
Some of the very best 4 person tents for your next outdoor camping trip.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777757/rei-camp-dome-4-tent\">REI Camp Dome 4 Tent</a> - If you just want<strong> something simple that will be ideal for a bit of recreational camping</strong>, and wont cost too much, then the Camp Dome from REI's in house brand is the perfect tent. It's a<strong> basic dome tent, with 2 doors</strong> for everyone inside to have easy access to the outside, though just awnings, and no vestibules. It's not the lightest tent ever, at <strong>9 pounds 7 ounces, or 4.28 kilograms</strong>, but it makes up for that with the price, which is far lower than either of the other tents listed below. So a basic 4 person tent with a <strong>very attractive price</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-4-tent-4-person-3-season\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 4</a> - The Fly Creek tent is what you want if you're not concerned about the price, and are much more concerned about the weight. At <strong>just 4 pounds 1 ounce, or 1.84 kilograms</strong> it is considerably lighter than the REI tent above, but then the materials and design used to achieve that impressive weight do add quite a bit to the price. It's also <strong>a little cramped, with just 49.5 square feet of floor space</strong>, but then a roomy tent would weigh more. So a good 4 person tent for backpackers and others who have to carry their gear.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-bombshelter-tent-4-person-4-season\">Black Diamond Bombshelter Tent</a> - The Bombshelter is a tent <strong>designed for 4 season use</strong>. More than anything, it is strong enough and durable enough to stand up to wind, snow and whatever else you might come up against while camping or backpacking in the winter. It's <strong>a single wall design</strong>, since you're not likely to be using your tent without a rain fly in the winter, and has <strong>2 doors, and 2 vestibules as well</strong>. It has 4 poles, for the most strength possible, and the wall material is breathable, so that you don't get too much condensation building up inside. At <strong>8 pounds 13 ounces, or 4 kilograms</strong> it's not terribly lightweight, but then with four season tents the focus is always on making a tent that is strong enough to survive.</li>

But if you need it now, there are a few things you can do to get a cheap backpacking backpack that wont immediately fall apart the first time you use it.
<h2>Cheap Backpacking Backpacks</h2>
What to look for when shopping for cheap backpacking backpacks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Features</strong> – Decide, before you go looking at backpacking backpacks, what features you really cant live without, because there are plenty of them to be had on a backpack. A sleeping bag compartment, for instance, is a convenient thing to have, but by no means necessary. The same could be said about fancy back panels with maximized air flow.</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – Generally, the bigger the backpack is the more it‘s going to cost you. It’s a good idea, then, to try and get the bulk and weight of the rest of your gear down as much as possible, so that you can get as small a backpack as possible. If you <!--more-->can manage to get your load weight down far enough you can start looking at frameless backpacks, which are typically quite cheap.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Cheap Backpacking Backpacks</h2>
Some of the best cheap backpacking backpacks for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-terra-65-backpack-3950cu-in\">The North Face Terra 65</a> - The Terra is a solid, basic backpack to take backpacking. It has <strong>everything that you would want for backpacking, including features like a sleeping bag compartment and a couple of mesh pockets on the side for easily accessed water bottles</strong>. It also has a good frame, and is hydration compatible. And the <strong>65 liters of capacity</strong> is a good amount for most backpackers. The only real drawback with the Terra is the weight. At <strong>5 pounds 1 ounce, or 2.29 kilograms</strong> <strong>for the large it's rather heavy</strong>, and depending on how long you are going to be backpacking for, a heavy backpack may not be something you want to have to carry.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - The Circuit has a similar capacity to the Terra 65 above, at <strong>68 liters of total space</strong>, but a <strong>weight of just 2 pounds 4 ounces, or 1.02 kilograms</strong>, which really puts the weight of the Terra 65 above in to perspective. The Circuit also comes with plenty of excellent features, including <strong>an ultralight aluminum frame</strong> that's removable, a hydration sleeve inside for a water bladder, and <strong>even pockets on the hip belt</strong>, so that you don't have to take your backpack off to get a snack out, for instance. So lots of features and capacity, but with a very low, reasonable weight and a similarly reasonable price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795513/rei-mars-80-pack\">REI Mars 80</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795519/rei-venus-70-pack-womens\">Women's Venus</a>) - The Mars, and the smaller women's version called the Venus are the kinds of backpacks you want when you need to carry a big, large load but don't want to spend a lot. Most backpacks get more expensive the larger they are, but with<strong> 80 liters of capacity</strong> the Mars is actually cheaper than the smaller Circuit above. It has all the <strong>usual features of a large backpack, including a frame, plenty of padding, ample external storage pockets and a removable top pocket</strong>. But at <strong>5 pounds 12 ounces, or 2.61 kilograms</strong> it's another backpack that suffers from being rather heavy. So big and cheap, but you can expect sore knees after a long day of walking with this backpack on.</li>

What makes <strong>winter fleece jackets</strong> such a good item to have in winter conditions is, for starters, that they come in a variety of thicknesses. Fleece is also naturally good at repelling water, and wont absorb water like another fabric, like cotton might. Not that many people would be silly enough to wear a cotton outer layer in winter.
<h2>Winter Fleece Jackets</h2>
What to look for when you're reviewing winter fleece jackets.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Thickness</strong> – As alluded to above, fleece comes in a variety of thicknesses, starting with micro fleece, which is the thinnest, which is followed by 100, 200 and then 300 weight fleece. So for a winter fleece jacket, you would likely want to stick to 300, and maybe 200 fleece jackets.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened</strong> – Cold isn’t the only thing you usually have to worry about in the winter. Wind is another winter weather condition that can wreak havoc. Fortunately, many fleece jackets <!--more-->have hardened outer surfaces, which make them a lot better at deflecting wind, rather than letting it penetrate through to you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Winter Fleece Jackets</h2>
Some of the best winter fleece jacket options for both men and women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/785468/mountain-hardwear-monkey-man-fleece-jacket-mens\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Fleece Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - This is a great winter jacket <strong>for around town and a few adventures in the outdoors too</strong>. It's not a hardened outer surface, rather it's <strong>a fluffy, piled outer surface</strong>, which does help to cut down on wind and moisture penetration. It's also <strong>heavy 300 weight fleece</strong>, which is the thickest option when it comes to fleece, and the best option for winter weather. Beyond that it comes with a couple zippered hand pockets, a zippered chest pocket and no hood. It's also has the lowest price of any of the jackets on this list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/r4-jacket-men-s\">Patagonia R4 Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786262/mountain-hardwear-monkey-woman-fleece-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - Patagonia doesn't list what thickness of fleece they use for their R4 jacket, but it's <strong>their thickest and warmest one</strong>, and the one best suited for winter conditions. It's similar to the Monkey Man above, without the unique outer surface, but also not a hardened outer surface. It does <strong>come with a more athletic cut</strong>, however, so a better option for layering. It also comes with a <strong>zippered chest pocket, along with two zippered hand warmer pockets</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-fleece-jacket-mens\">Arc'teryx Hyllus Fleece Hooded Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-hyllus-hooded-softshell-jacket-womens\">Women's</a>) - The Hyllus is the winter fleece jacket you want when you're having winter adventures in the outdoors. It's made with <strong>300 weight fleece</strong>, which is complimented by a <strong>hardened outer surface, which helps to protect you from the wind and the rain, or snow</strong>. The Hyllus also <strong>has a hood, with a drawcord</strong>, so you can really get out of the weather as much as possible. It has a couple of hand warmer pockets, plus a zippered storage pocket on the sleeve. So not a cheap option, certainly, but the best technical fleece jacket for winter conditions.</li>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-100-premium-silk-sleeping-bag-liner\">Sea to Summit Premium Silk Sleeping Bag Liner</a> - Another silk sleeping bag liner, this time from Sea to Summit. The <strong>claim is that it adds a full 10 degrees of warmth to a sleeping</strong>, which<!--more--> if true, is very impressive. And it delivers that 10 degrees of warmth for just <strong>4.4 ounces, or 124 grams for the mummy version</strong>, which is even more impressive. Another nice touch is that <strong>you can get a pillow case built in</strong>, so if you do take a pillow with, or alternatively you want something to stuff clothes in to make a pillow, you have that option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/rab-100-silk-sleeping-bag-liner\">Rab Silk Sleeping Bag Liner</a> - Rab, a manufacturer well known for their well made sleeping bags, also has a silk sleeping bag liner on the market. This one comes in a <strong>variety of different shapes</strong>, but the mummy version weighs in at <strong>11 ounces, or 340 grams</strong>. No word on how much added warmth you can expect, but for that much weight you would expect it to be quite a bit.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/silk-sheet\">Mont Bell Silk Sheet</a> - One more sleeping bag liner, this time from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell. It's a <strong>mummy shape</strong>, and while Mont Bell is sparse on the details, it weighs <strong>6.2 ounces, or 175 grams</strong>, so you should be able to expect at least a few degrees of additional warmth.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why Take a Silk Sleeping Bag Liner</h2>
If you've never used a sleeping bag liner before, or are hesitant to add extra weight to your backpack without needing to, here are a few reasons why you might want to at least consider a silk sleeping bag liner.

<strong>First</strong>, if you are going to take any sleeping bag liner, silk is probably your best option. It adds a respectable amount of warmth but weighs relatively little, compared to other materials like fleece or cotton.

<strong>Second</strong>, a silk sleeping bag liner is a nice bit of luxury. Personally I've never liked sleeping with my bare skin against nylon, and I find a sleeping bag liner to be the perfect solution.

<strong>Third</strong>, you can expect a few degrees of warmth to be added to your sleeping bag. If you are going backpacking or camping with a sleeping bag that is not quite warm enough for the weather you are expecting, a sleeping bag liner is one way to add a little warmth to your sleeping bag. Whatever happens, you want to be able to sleep all night long, rather than shiver all night long."

It is much the same thing as pepper spray, but with a formulation that is better suited to affect the senses of a bear, as opposed to a human.
<h2>Using Bear Spray</h2>
To use bear spray, you would remove the safety clip, point the nozzle in the direction of the bear, and spray away. The spray does not go extremely far, and you will want to wait until the bear is fairly close before using it. You only get one shot, so you want to make it count.

Bear spray contains 2 percent Capsaicin, which is the same active ingredient in pepper spray. So if you get some blowback from the spray it will affect you as well, much in the same <!--more-->way pepper spray would.
<h2>Best Bear Spray</h2>
There aren't too many different bear sprays sold on the market, but the bear spray made by Counter Assault is generally regarded as the best. It comes in a 290 gram size, as well as a 230 gram size.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/722005/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-290g\">290 Gram Counter Assault</a> - The 290 gram size will reach <strong>distances of 12 to 32 feet, and will spray for a total of 9.2 seconds</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/623173/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-230g\">230 Gram Counter Assault</a> - The 230 gram size reaches <strong>distances of 12 to 30 feet, and gives you a total of 7 seconds of spray</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bear Spray Accessories</h2>
You need to be able to deploy bear spray extremely quickly, which is why there are a few accessories that it can be a good idea to have with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828376/counter-assault-bear-deterrent-spray-holster-230290g\">Holster</a> - This holster is made for either size of Counter Assault bear spray. It has a velcro strap the keep the bear spray secure, and easily attaches to a belt or backpack. The velco strap is ideal for quick access to the bear spray in the event that you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/kozee-tote-bear-pepper-spray-container\">Carrying Case</a> - If you plan on traveling with your bear spray, a carrying case of some sort is a good idea. If you are traveling in an enclosed space, such as a plane, helicopter, or vehicle, the last thing you want is your bear spray misfiring and incapacitating the driver. A secure carrying case prevents that.</li>

You get the same protection for you and your sleeping while through the night, but without any unnecessary room or tent poles. But sleeping in such an enclosed space, you need something that is both waterproof, to keep water out, and breathable, to allow condensation from your breath to escape. Which is why a <strong>gore-tex bivy sack</strong> is such a good option.
<h2>Gore-Tex Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for on a gore-tex bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bug Netting -</strong> Most bivy sacks will have an opening for you to get some fresh air through, and that opening may or may not be covered with bug netting. If bugs aren't a worry where you are then you don't have anything to worry about, but if mosquitoes will eat you alive at night, a bug net on the opening of your bivy sack is a very nice feature to have.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight -</strong> A bivy sack is usually a lightweight replacement for a tent, but even within the world of bivy sacks, there<!--more--> are heavy models and lightweight models. Remember that there is no point in carrying a heavy bivy sack when a lightweight bivy sack will perform just as well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Gore-Tex Bivy Sack</h2>
A few of the better examples of gore-tex being used for a bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-bipod-bivy-bag\">Black Diamond Bipod Bivy Bag</a> - The Bipod is a more deluxe bivy sack. It has a <strong>single pole that arches over the face area</strong> of the bivy sack, which helps to keep the bivy sack off of your face and also gives you some breathing room. This also gives you the option to roll the flap of the bivy sack back like a tent for a little ventilation, revealing the <strong>no-see-um netting</strong> below. All those deluxe features, however, mean that the Bipod weighs a rather hefty <strong>1 pound 13 ounces, or 822 grams</strong>. It's also made out of <strong>Todd Tex, which seems to be a proprietary version of Gore-Tex</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/747829/outdoor-research-aurora-bivy\">Outdoor Research Aurora Bivy</a> - The Aurora is more of a standard bivy sack. The top is <strong>3 layer Gore-Tex</strong>, while the bottom is coated nylon. The top portion of the bivy sack can be zipped back for a little star gazing and ventilation, and you have the option of <strong>mesh to cover the open flap</strong>, protecting you from bugs. The weight is still fairly hefty though, at <strong>1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gore-Tex Alternatives</h2>
Gore-Tex makes a great fabric for bivy sacks because it is waterproof and breathable, but there are a couple other fabrics that perform just as well as gore-tex. One is eVENT. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-lite-bivi\">Rab Alpine Lite Bivi</a>, for instance, uses <strong>eVENT</strong> to protect you from the weather, and does it weighing just <strong>15 ounces, or 420 grams, which is significantly less than the two Gore-Tex bivy sacks above</strong>.

Blisters, hot spots and sore muscles can all be a thing of the past with a good pair of hiking shoes. Of course, there are many differences between men and women's feet, which means that <strong>hiking shoes for women</strong> are quite a bit different than shoes for men. But regardless of what gender you are buying for, there are some things to keep in mind when reviewing hiking shoes.
<h2>Hiking Shoes for Women</h2>
What to look for when you are looking for hiking shoes for women.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> When buying hiking shoes, you should always be trying to find the lightest pair possible. Every pound of shoe on your feet is equal to about 5 pounds of weight on your back, in terms of energy expenditure. So strapping on a pair of heavy hiking shoes is like throwing a 10 pound weight in to your backpack. Not smart, and not fun at the end of the day.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof and Breathable -</strong> Everyone wants their hiking shoes to be waterproof and breathable, but it's extremely difficult to find a pair of hiking <!--more-->shoes that does both very well. It's much better to pick either waterproof or breathable, and get a pair of hiking shoes that does that one thing well.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Shoes for Women</h2>
The best of hiking shoes for women.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/merrell-siren-sport-gtx-xcr-shoe-womens\">Merrell Siren Sport GTX XCR Shoe</a> - The Sirens make an ideal waterproof hiking shoe for those wetter times and places. They have a <strong>Gore-Tex liner</strong>, which is the XCR variant, the more <strong>breathable Gore-Tex</strong>. Added to that, they're also mostly mesh on the upper portion of the shoe, which will, again, breath well. The sole is <strong>Vibram</strong>, so you can be sure you will have a good grip. The pair <strong>weighs 1 pound 8 ounces, or 680 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795722/salomon-xt-wings-2-trail-running-shoes-womens\">Salomon XT Wings 2 Trail-Running Shoes</a> - Don't let the trail running shoe scare you, trail runners actually make some of the best hiking shoes. They're meant for the trail, and they're also usually lightweight and breathable, features important for runners. These particular trail runners from Salomon are <strong>very breathable</strong>, with a mostly mesh upper, and are built well for logging a lot of miles in. A quick, <strong>single pull lacing system</strong> is also a nice touch. The pair weighs <strong>23 ounces, or 650 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mountain-masochist-trailrunner-women-s\">Montrail Mountain Masochist Trailrunner</a> - The Mountain Masochists are another trail runner, this time from Montrail. What really stands out about them is their weight, which is a <strong>very impressive 18.4 ounces, or 522 grams</strong>, which is significantly less than either of the other hiking shoes for women listed above. They're a <strong>low profile shoe, and very breathable</strong>. If you want a lightweight hiking shoe without too many frills, they are a great choice.</li>

You don't always have the chance to eat on a flat surface in the outdoors, after all, and sometimes you need a plate that has high enough sides to keep your food on the plate, and not on the ground.
<h2>Camping Plates and Bowls</h2>
Whether you decide on a plate, bowl or something in between, these are the features you should be looking for.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight -</strong> There are some fairly large differences in the weights of various camping plates and bowls, and if you are carrying your plates and bowls, you might as well get the light ones, instead of the heavy ones.</li>
	<li><strong>Material -</strong> Related to weight is the material that your plates and bowls are made out of. You have a few different choices, and the main difference between them is weight. Some lightweight materials, like titanium<!--more--> for instance, do also tend to cost more, so you have to decide how much you really want to spend too.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Camping Plates and Bowls</h2>
The very best camping plates and bowls for your next outdoor adventure.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720285/snow-peak-titanium-plate\">Snow Peak Titanium Plate</a> - Titanium makes a great material for a camping plate. It holds up very well to use and abuse, does not impart any sort of metallic taste on to the food, and is easy to clean when you're done. This particular <strong>titanium plate</strong> comes with<strong> raised sides</strong>, to help keep the food where it belongs, and has a <strong>diameter of 7.5 inches</strong>, which should be enough for even a large meal. Best of all, it <strong>weighs just 2 ounces, or 56 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-deep-dish-plate\">MSR Deep Dish Plate</a> - The Deep Dish is a great <strong>bowl, plate combo</strong>. It's made with <strong>non-leaching polypropylene</strong>, which makes the Deep Dish both a cheap option and a lightweight option, at just <strong>2.6 ounces, or 75 grams for the medium</strong>. It also comes in a large and a small. The medium has a <strong>7.6 diameter</strong>, but the stand out feature is the <strong>1.7 inch high sides</strong>, which allows the Deep Dish to work equally well as plate or bowl. If you want just one thing to eat all your meals off of, and don't want to spend a lot either, the Deep Dish is ideal.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-bowl\">Snow Peak Titanium Bowl</a> - On the bowl end of things there is another <strong>excellent titanium option from Snow Peak</strong>. It has a <strong>diameter of 7.5 inches</strong> at the rim and <strong>weighs just 2 ounces, or 56 grams</strong>. If you have your heart set on a bowl, you wont do any better than this.</li>

Filters are great for getting rid of all those particles, but water purifiers do a great job of neutralizing whatever is in the water, and as a bonus, purifiers tend to weigh quite a bit less than filters. The only real disadvantage of purifiers is that you sometimes have to wait for the purifier to do its job, depending on what kind of purifier you decide on.
<h2>Hiking Water Purifier</h2>
Features to look for when you are shopping for hiking water purifiers.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Purification Method</strong> - There are actually a few different methods that are used to purify drinking water, and depending on what your needs are, one may be more suitable than the other. Chemicals, for instance, do a great job of purifying water, but typically need a certain amount of time to work. UV light is another option that works very quickly, but then you need to carry around the UV purifier, which is quite a bit larger and bulkier than a few tablets of chemicals.</li>
	<li><strong>Time to Purify</strong> - As alluded to above, the time to purify <!--more-->depends a great deal on what purification method you go with. UV light works very quickly, for instance, while many chemicals take hours to get the job done.</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - The main advantage of purifiers over filters is that purifiers tend to weigh quite a bit less. So don't throw that advantage away by getting a big, heavy filter.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Hiking Water Purifiers</h2>
A few of the better hiking water purifiers that you can choose from, based on the above criteria.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/micropur-purification-30-tablets\">Katadyn Micropur Purification Tablets</a> - The lightest option when it comes to hiking water purifiers is chemicals, like these <strong>chlorine dioxide tablets</strong> from Katadyn. The whole package of <strong>30 tablets weighs just .9 ounces, or 25 grams, and one tablet is good for one liter of water</strong>, but you have to wait for a total of <strong>four hours for the tablets to kill everything</strong> in the water, so there is a clear trade-off between weight and waiting.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/671111/msr-sweetwater-water-purifier-system\">MSR Sweetwater Purifier</a> - Something slightly different, the Sweetwater is actually a <strong>combination of filter and purifier</strong>. It uses <strong>.2 micron filter</strong> to first get rid of any sizable particles, and then a <strong>chlorine purification system</strong> takes care of anything that made it through the filter. It's a great unit for really bad water sources. It <strong>weighs 11.3 ounces, which is 320 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\">SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - The whole SteriPEN line uses <strong>UV light to neutralize anything bad</strong> lurking in your water. It's easy to use, you just stick the bulb in to your water bottle and the UV light does the rest, at <strong>8 minutes per gallon of water</strong>. It's also relatively lightweight, at <strong>3.6 ounces, or 102 grams</strong>. The only real drawback of using UV light is that you have to <strong>replace the batteries every 50 liters</strong>, so depending on how long your trip is, you might end up carrying extra batteries.</li>

The advantage of using a few smaller tents is that you don’t have everyone in one tent, and so one snorer, for instance, does not disrupt the sleeping of the entire group. Smaller tents can also end up weighing less on a per person basis, as a lightweight <strong>6 person tent</strong> is a rare thing. Still, one 6 person tent means there is only one tent to carry, and as long as you’re not the one carrying it, it’s not so bad.
<h2>6 Person Tent</h2>
Features to look for when you’re in the market for a new 6 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Floor Space</strong> – When you get in to larger tents, it’s a good idea to compare floor sizes, as differences in floor spaces can become quite a bit more marked at larger capacities. Also try to think about space needed for gear inside the tent, if people will be bringing much inside with them.</li>
	<li><strong>Doors</strong> – When it’s just two people in a tent, disturbing the other person is not such a big concern. But with 6 people crammed in it’s bound to happen, and so having more than one door is often a good idea. That <!--more-->way, people don’t have to crawl all over each other to get to that one door.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 6 Person Tent</h2>
There aren't many 6 person tents out there, but these are a few of the best choices.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/kelty-trail-ridge-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Kelty Trail Ridge</a> - First, the <strong>lightest tent on this list. At 13 pounds and 13 ounces, which is 6.26 kilograms</strong>, you would still be better off carrying a couple 3 man tents if your goal was to save weight. But if you had to carry a 6 man tent in a backpack, this would be the best choice. But beyond that the Trail Ridge comes with <strong>2 doors</strong>, so that you're not crawling over people in the night, and a total of <strong>80 square feet of floor space</strong>. One other nice feature is <strong>noiseless zippers</strong>, which, when there are 6 people in a tent, can be a real bonus for those midnight bathroom breaks.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/halo-6-tent-6-person-3-season\">Marmot Halo</a> - At the other end of the spectrum in terms of weight is the Halo from Marmot. You might think that the extra weight makes it more suitable for 4 season camping, but it's listed as a 3 season tent. The extra weight does go somewhere, however, and a big portion of it appears to be in floor space. At <strong>100 square feet, it is by far the largest of the 6 person tents</strong> listed here. Beyond that it has the standard features, including<strong> two doors</strong> so that you have more than one entry and exit, eliminating the need to crawl over a whole bunch of people in the night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/827807/rei-kingdom-6-tent-2012\">REI Kingdom</a> - At <strong>17 pounds and 3 ounces, or 7.8 kilograms</strong>, the Kingdom is only slightly lighter than the much bigger Halo above. The one thing that the Kingdom definitely does have going for it is a <strong>zippable partition wall that runs down the center</strong> of the tent. When you'r sleeping with 5 other people, creating a two room tent can cut down on a lot of noise that might keep you awake. <strong>Each side of the tent also has a door</strong>, so that you don't need to go through the partition to get outside. So definitely not a lightweight option, but you might appreciate the partition feature.</li>

These towels absorb more water than their cotton counterparts, and most of the water can be rung out and you can keep right on drying. Microfiber towels also dry quite a bit faster than the cotton variety, meaning you can use it at night and if it’s not dry in the morning, a few hours hanging from your pack in the sun will do the job.
<h2> Microfiber Camping Towel</h2>
Features to look at when you're shopping for a new microfiber camping towel.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> – There aren’t many variables when it comes to something as simple as a towel, but size is definitely one of them. What you need to keep in mind with a microfiber towel is that it doesn’t need to be as big as a regular towel. These towels can be rung out and then used again. You can actually do just fine with an extremely small microfiber camping towel, though bigger sizes are available.</li>
	<li><strong>Hook</strong> – Most microfiber camping towels come with a little loop of fabric in one corner. When you’re in the outdoors you don’t have access to something like <!--more-->a dryer, and so you need to let microfiber towels dry on their own. The easiest way to hang a towel is with that little loop. You can even attach it somewhere to your backpack during the day, to let the sun, which is hopefully out, dry it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Microfiber Camping Towel</h2>
A few of the better microfiber camping towels.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783080/rei-multitowel-lite-x-large-towel-49-x-295\">REI MultiTowel Lite X Large Towel</a> - The Multitowel from REI is actually a <strong>blend of 15% nylon microfiber and 85% polyester</strong>. It will absorb up to 8 times its weight in water, and most of that water can be rung out so you can keep on drying. It comes with a handy <strong>hook in one corner, and in two smaller sizes</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783079/rei-multitowel-lite-large-towel-37-x-235\">large</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/783078/rei-multitowel-lite-medium-towel-255-x-155\">medium</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packtowl-personal\">MSR Packtowl Personal</a> - The Packtowl from MSR is another <strong>blend of microfiber and polyester</strong>, which provides same excellent absorption to weight ratio that you get with the Mulitowel above. It also comes with a <strong>small hook in the corner</strong> for easy hanging, but comes in <strong>four different sizes</strong>, as opposed to the three for the Multitowel.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-tek-towel.html\">Sea to Summit Tek Towel</a> - The Tek is supposed to have more of a <strong>plush, soft feel</strong>, whereas many other microfiber towels can feel quite dense and not very soft. Like the other two towels it comes with a handy <strong>loop of fabric in one corner to hang it</strong>. Unlike the other two it comes in an impressive <strong>5 different sizes</strong>, so there really is something for everyone.</li>

The temperature needed will depend on where you live and what the conditions are like there, but a <strong>0 degree sleeping bag</strong> is a good number to shoot for. It’s a nice round number and there are quite a few excellent 0 degree sleeping bags on the market. So if it matches your needs, definitely consider 0 degrees as a minimum temperature for your next sleeping bag.
<h2>0 Degree Sleeping Bag</h2>
Features to be looking for when shopping for a 0 degree sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Extras</strong> – At 0 degrees you’re don’t need the extras, but they will definitely do a lot to keep you warm. Things like draft collars, for instance, and drawcords on the face opening of the sleeping bag will do a lot to help keep you warm at night when the temperature dips.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> – As with any sleeping bag you have to make a decision on what insulation you want. Synthetic is<!--more--> good for when it gets wet, which is always a possibility in winter, but if you can keep down dry it offers a better warmth to weight ratio, especially with higher quality down in the 800 to 900 fill range.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 0 Degree Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the best 0 degree sleeping bags out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lithium-0-sleeping-bag-850-down\">Marmot Lithium 0 Sleeping Bag</a> - First up, the <strong>2008 winner of the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. It's good down to 0 degrees, of course, and has a <strong>draft collar, drawcord around the face and a draft tube along the zipper</strong> too so that you can take every possible measure to keep warm air inside the sleeping bag. It uses <strong>850+ fill down</strong>, which is a very high quality, and <strong>weighs 2 pounds 12 ounces, or 1.24 kilograms</strong>, making it one of the lighter 0 degree sleeping bags on the market.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom +0 Sleeping Bag</a> - Another very lightweight sleeping bag at the 0 degree temperature mark, with a weight of <strong>2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms</strong>. The <strong>zipper is insulated, and the drawcord around the face</strong> works well with an ergonomically shaped shoulder area to seal out air leaks. It uses <strong>800 fill down</strong>, which is not as high as the 850 of the Lithium, but still very good.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-u.l.-super-spiral-hugger-0-down-sleeping-bag-0-degree.html\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Hugger #0</a> - Another excellent 0 degree sleeping bag, this time from Mont Bell. It's another down bag, and uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>. It has all the extras you could ask for, including a a <strong>draft tube down the length of the zipper and a draft collar</strong>. Mont Bell's unique diagonal cut helps to squeeze the bag around you, providing even more warmth. What stands out here, however, is the <strong>DWR, water resistant finish</strong>, which will protect the down inside from the water outside. It <strong>won the 2009 Gear of the Year award from Outside magazine, and weighs just 2 pounds 11 ounces, or 1.21 kilograms</strong>.</li>

And such a thing does indeed exist. It’s generally a better idea, however, to get boots or shoes that will keep water out, so that you don’t have to wear something like waterproof hiking socks to begin with.
<h2>Waterproof Hiking Socks</h2>
What to look for when you're shopping for waterproof hiking socks.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> – As with anything that is claimed to be waterproof, you need to do your research on the material that it’s made out of and find out just how waterproof it really is. Gore-Tex is a fairly dependable choice, and there are indeed Gore-Tex socks out there that will keep your feet dry.</li>
	<li><strong>Sizing and Seams</strong> – One thing that you definitely want to pay attention to when buying waterproof <!--more-->hiking socks is what kind of sizes are available, and where the seams are located. Socks that are far too big and have awkwardly placed seams, for instance, may keep your feet dry, but may also cause blisters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Waterproof Hiking Socks</h2>
A few of the better waterproof hiking sock choices on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/828611/sealskinz-waterproof-crew-socks-unisex\">SealSkinz Waterproof Crew Socks</a> - These are probably the most complex socks you will ever own. The <strong>outside is a blend of nylon and spandex</strong>, which gives them a great, stretchy fit. The <strong>inside is CoolMax</strong>, which helps to wick moisture away from the skin. And <strong>sandwiched between those two layers is a waterproof polyurethane membrane</strong>. So they're a standalone sock, rather than something you would wear over top of a regular sock, but clearly a product that a lot of thought and design went in to.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/688268/rocky-gore-tex-oversocks-socks\">Rocky Gore-Tex Oversocks</a> - These are the kind of thing that you <strong>wear on top of another hiking sock</strong>. They're Gore-Tex, as the name suggests, and are supposed to fit relatively snug, as they come in a range of sizes. The <strong>seams are also positioned well to minimize rubbing</strong> and other long term problems. So if you want something that you can slip on when it starts pouring, these are a great choice.</li>

There is plenty of gear that will perform when conditions are good, but the real test for gear is when conditions are not good, and conditions are very often not good in the alpine. Alpine camping and backpacking gear needs to be able to handle things like wind, rain and the occasional storm, and all while keeping you comfortable and performing well for the duration of your trip.
<h2>Alpine Sleeping Bags</h2>
What to look for when buying an alpine sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Water Resistant</strong> – At the very least, your alpine sleeping bag should be water resistant, and maybe even waterproof. If the insulation inside your sleeping bag gets wet it will do a much worse job of keeping you warm. For that reason, it’s in your best interest to keep that insulation warm, especially in alpine conditions where things can get wet more easily.</li>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> – Another important thing to pay attention to when it comes to alpine weather <!--more-->conditions is the temperature rating of your sleeping bag. It’s certainly possible to improve your warmth inside a sleeping bag, by wearing layers to bed, for instance, but a temperature rating safely below the temperature you’re expecting is the safer thing to do.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Alpine Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the better alpine sleeping bags to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-ultralite-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down\">Western Mountaineering UltraLite Sleeping Bag</a> - The Ultralite from Western Mountaineering is a great sleeping bag <strong>good down to 20 degrees</strong>, which is ample for many summer alpine excursions. It uses very <strong>high quality 850+ fill down</strong>, and has a few essential features, like a draft collar, to help keep you warm. It's not a water resistant or waterproof sleeping bag, but it helps make up for that by weighing a <strong>very reasonable 1 pound 10 ounces, or 737 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-spiral-down-hugger-1-800-down\">Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #1</a> - Another very good sleeping bag with a <strong>temperature rating of 15 degrees</strong>, so slightly warmer than the Ultralite above. This one only <strong>uses 800+ fill down</strong>, which is still a very high quality, but does also include a <strong>durable water repellent treatment, or DWR</strong>, which will help keep the down dry. It's also the <strong>2009 winner of the Outside Magazine Gear of the Year award</strong>. It weighs a <strong>very respectable2 pounds, or 907 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom +0 Sleeping Bag</a> - Finally, for those colder alpine environments there's something like the Phantom. It uses a <strong>very narrow mummy cut</strong> which is designed specifically for alpine adventurers. It uses <strong>800+ fill down</strong>, and has a <strong>DWR, or durable water repellent finish</strong>, so you don't have to worry so much about getting it wet. But what really helps it stand out amongst the 0 degree sleeping bags, and there are a lot of them, is the <strong>very low weight of 2 pounds 10 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms</strong>. So a great all around sleeping bag with a specific alpine mummy cut.</li>

There are also plenty of sleeping bags that exist somewhere in between those two extremes. Mummy sleeping bags eliminate excess space inside the sleeping bag, which makes them more efficient, both in terms of heat and also weight. But a <strong>rectangular down sleeping bag</strong>, for example, might be a better choice if you like to move around a lot when you sleep, but still want to save on weight and bulk.
<h2>Rectangular Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
What to look for when you want a rectangular down sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Down Quality</strong> – You wont find too many rectangular sleeping bags with high quality down, most manufacturers reserve the good stuff for their mummy shaped sleeping bags. But better quality down will help cut down on weight and bulk, which you will likely want to do if you’re buying a rectangular sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Hood</strong> – Many rectangular sleeping bags are built with car campers and the like in mind, and don’t come with hoods. But if you’re going to be doing anything more<!--more--> than car camping you will likely want a hood on your sleeping bag. You will also likely want a drawcord for the hood and the neck area, to trap warm air inside.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Rectangular Down Sleeping Bag</h2>
Some of the very best rectangular down sleeping bags.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/797048/kelty-galactic-30-sleeping-bag-regular\">Kelty Galactic</a> - If you're looking for just a <strong>basic rectangular down sleeping bag</strong>, the Galactic makes a good choice. It uses <strong>600 fill down</strong>, which is not especially high quality, and is truly rectangular, rather than being semi-rectangular. It also doesn't have a hood, but with a <strong>temperature rating of 30 degrees</strong> you're not likely to be out in the kind of weather that requires a hood. But at <strong>2 pounds 14 ounces, or 1.3 kilograms</strong> it's not the heaviest rectangular sleeping bag ever, and the low price is definitely a bonus.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-dreamwalker-650-sleeping-bag-20-degree-down\">Exped DreamWalker</a> - The DreamWalker is something a little different. It uses <strong>750 fill down</strong>, and is <strong>good down to 20 degrees</strong>. But what makes it special is that when you wake up you <strong>can open up slots in the sides and the bottom so that your legs and arms can poke out</strong>, so that you can stay warm while making breakfast and a morning coffee. It has a hood as well, which is definitely a must for the 20 degree mark, and weighs <strong>39 ounces, or 1.1 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/blackburn-0-sl-sleeping-bag-800-down\">Big Agnes Blackburn SL</a> - The Blackburn is a great <strong>semi-rectangular sleeping bag</strong>, which means that it's somewhere in between mummy and rectangular. It's <strong>good all the way down to 0 degrees</strong>, and uses high quality <strong>800 fill down</strong> to help save on weight and bulk. It has <strong>a hood, of course, and other cold weather features like a draft collar</strong> that will ensure that you stay warm. It even has a <strong>water repellent treatment</strong> so that you don't have to worry about the down getting wet from a little moisture. And at <strong>2 pounds 13 ounces, or 1.27 kilograms</strong> it is a respectable enough weight for being a semi-rectangular down sleeping bag.</li>

You should know that after about the 4 person capacity point, tents become quite a bit heavier, and unless you’re car camping or looking for a tent for base camp, an <strong>8 person tent</strong> is better split up in to a couple 4 person tents, or some other combination. But if you have your heart set on an 8 person tent, there are certainly some good options out there that will keep you comfortable and dry.
<h2>8 Person Tent</h2>
What to look for when you're looking for an 8 person tent.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Floor Space</strong> – The floor space between two different 1 man tents isn’t likely to be all that much, but when you multiply by 8 those differences can get rather large. Which is why it is a good idea to look at the floor space available inside various 8 person tents, so that you get an idea of the actual space available.</li>
	<li><strong>Doors and Partitions</strong> – With 8 people sleeping inside one tent, you are definitely going to need more than one door, or else people are going to be crawling all over each<!--more--> other to reach that one door. Similarly, many larger tents come with a zipper partition to divide the tent in half, to cut down on noise and other disturbances at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 8 Person Tent</h2>
Some of the very best 8 person tents.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flying-diamond-8-tent-8-person-4-seas\">Big Agnes Flying Diamond</a> - The Flying Diamond is a <strong>good four season option</strong> for those that don't want to spend a whole lot. It comes with a very respectable <strong>112 square feet of floor space</strong>. It also comes with the option to separate the entire tent in to a larger and smaller section with a zippered partition wall, which could be useful as separate sleeping space or as a room for gear storage.  <strong>Each of the sections, of course, has a separate door</strong>. The whole thing <strong>weighs 22 pounds 6 ounces, or 10.14 kilograms</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/the-north-face-dome-8-tent-8-person-4-season\">The North Face Dome</a> - The Dome is the kind of 8 person tent that would be used for base camp on a windy mountain slope. It's a dome shape, obviously, and has an <strong>impressive ten poles</strong>, which will lend it a considerable amount of strength. The tent <strong>can actually be pitched without the floor, and three massive doors</strong> can be lowered to turn the whole thing in to a cook tent or meeting area. But it will also shelter you at night too, and with <strong>128 square feet of floor space</strong> there's plenty of room for 8. But at <strong>57 pounds 11 ounces, or 26.16 kilograms</strong> it's not the kind of tent that you're going to be carrying around for any great distances.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810168/rei-kingdom-8-tent-2012\">REI Kingdom</a> - The kingdom is the <strong>cheapest 8 person tent on the list</strong>, and a great choice if you just want something to do a little three season camping with. At <strong>19 pounds 14 ounces, which is 9.02 kilograms</strong> it's the lightest 8 person tent on the list, but with just <strong>104 square feet of floor space</strong> it's also the smallest. But rectangular shape lends itself well to an efficient use of space, and the <strong>two doors, plus a zippered partition</strong> will help make sleeping in close quarters a little more bearable. So a solid 8 person tent to do a little camping with.</li>

But an <strong>emergency bivy sack</strong> is another kind of bivy sack, the kind that you pull out when things go wrong and you need some shelter from the elements. They’re often relatively cheap, and don’t bother with things like breathability. Instead, the priority is on keeping you dry and protected from the elements, so that you can survive any emergency.
<h2>Emergency Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for from an emergency bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> – If you’re going to be carrying your bivy sack just in case of emergency, then you probably don’t want to be hauling around a big, heavy bivy sack. Rather, you want something that you can throw in to the bottom of your backpack and forget about until you end you really needing it, for that emergency.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – Many bivy sacks come with a breathable material on top, so that you don’t end up sweating inside the bivy sack. But in an emergency the priority is on keeping you out of bad weather, and so you want your emergency<!--more--> bivy sack to be waterproof and windproof too, so that your emergency doesn’t get the better of you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Emergency Bivy Sack</h2>

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813511/sol-emergency-bivvy\">SOL Emergency Bivy</a> - This emergency bivy is <strong>small, lightweight and cheap</strong>, which is the ideal combination for an emergency bivy sack. It's both <strong>waterproof and windproof</strong>, so it will definitely keep you out of the elements, and comes in its own stuff sack for easy storage in your backpack. Best of all, it <strong>weighs just 3.8 ounces, or 107 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/adventure-medical-thermal-bivvy\">Adventure Medical SOL Thermal Bivy</a> - This is another emergency bivy more <strong>reminiscent of a thermal blanket</strong>. Like a thermal blanket it will reflect a good chunk of your body heat right back at your, so that you don't lose any heat. Unlike the traditional mylar thermal blankets, this is <strong>made of a little more durable material</strong>, so that you can use it more than once, or even as a summer sleeping bag. The more durable material does weigh more, however, the <strong>weight being 8.1 ounces, or 229 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Product_Type/Tents/Bivi__Bothy_Bags/Ultra_Bivi_Bag.html?view=description\">Terra Nova Ultra Bivi Bag</a> - The Ultra is a great choice if you don't mind spending a little money. At just <strong>2 ounces, or 50 grams, this is the lightest bivy on the list</strong>. To achieve that very impressive weight it uses some extremely good fabric that is <strong>windproof and waterproof</strong>, and packs down extremely small. So definitely not cheap, but an impressively lightweight and durable emergency bivy sack.</li>

So if you’re going to go with a big, heavy bivy sack, then you might as well just get an ultralight tent. Which is why an <strong>ultralight bivy sack</strong> is a good idea, because it accentuates what is important about the bivy sack, which is that it’s a lighter, less bulky option. And there are some excellent ultralight bivy sacks out there to choose from.
<h2>Ultralight Bivy Sack</h2>
What to look for when you want an ultralight bivy sack.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> – The degree to which your bivy sack is waterproof is important, because you don’t want to get wet, but you also don’t want to get sweaty inside the bivy sack as you’re sleeping. Added to that, waterproof materials like Gore Tex can often weigh quite a bit, making your bivy sack rather heavy.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Proof</strong> – Many bivy sacks have bug netting to go over the face opening of the bivy sack, to protect you from unwanted bites in the night. But if you really want to save some <!--more-->weight, you can get a bivy sack without this feature. Incidentally, you can always use a head bug net while you sleep, if the bugs do threaten.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Ultralight Bivy Sack</h2>
Some of the very best ultralight bivy sacks to choose from.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Product_Type/Tents/Bivi__Bothy_Bags/Ultra_Bivi_Bag.html?view=description\">Terra Nova Ultra Bivi</a> - At just <strong>1.7 ounces, or 50 grams</strong> this is without a doubt the lightest bivy sack you are going to find. And <strong>while it is waterproof, it's not breathable</strong>, so you need to be very careful that you don't get wet as a result of condensation build up inside the bivy. It's also not bug proof, but you can always wear a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-insect-shield-mosquito-head-net\">head bug net</a> to keep the bugs off. It's also <strong>rather expensive, due to the extremely high quality material</strong> used. But really cant argue with how light this bivy sack is.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/e-bivy-ul\">MSR E-Bivy UL</a> - The <strong>bottom of this bivy sack is waterproof, while the top is water resistant</strong>. That means the bivy sack will breath very well, and you will be safe from condensation. But it also means that anything more than some light showers or dew will get you wet. It also doesn't have any protection from the bugs, but again a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/799982/sea-to-summit-insect-shield-mosquito-head-net\">head bug net</a> worn at night will do the job of protecting you from bites. And at just <strong>9 ounces, or 250 grams</strong> it's a wonderfully lightweight option, with a good price.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/marmot-alpinist-bivy\">Marmot Alpinist Bivy</a> - The Alpinist uses a <strong>2.5 layer waterproof material to keep you totally dry</strong>, but also relatively well ventilated, which is the ideal combination for a bivy sack. There's no bug proofing, but <strong>you can fully zip up the opening</strong> which will keep both bugs and storms, which is what this bivy is built for, out while you sleep. It <strong>weighs in at 14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>.</li>

And there is quite a wide range of features available on headlamps, with many of them being designed for those that just want something to see at night, and others that are designed to illuminate the whole forest, and are ideal for those moving fast at night.
<h2>Top Rated Headlamps</h2>
What to look at when you want the top rated headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lumens</strong> – Lumens is the unit of measurement for how bright a headlamp is. The higher the lumens, the brighter the headlamp will be. What helps is to get a headlamp that has several power settings, so that you can boost the power, and the lumens when you need brightness, and then lower the power down when you want to conserve batteries.</li>
	<li><strong>Red Light</strong> – Another helpful feature that you may want on your headlamp is the ability to produce red light. Some headlamps do this with red LEDs while others have a lens that you can put over the white LEDs. Either way, red light doesn’t <!--more-->cause your pupil to dilate, and so when you turn the light off you’re not temporarily blind.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Top Rated Headlamps Reviews</h2>
A few quick reviews of some of the top rated headlamps.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/814301/black-diamond-storm-headlamp\">Black Diamond Storm Headlamp</a> - Part of what makes the Storm such a popular choice is that unlike many other headlamps it's <strong>completely waterproof</strong>, and thus the perfect headlamp to be wearing in a storm, as the name suggests. It also puts out an impressive <strong>100 lumens on the highest power setting, with a 70 meter beam distance</strong>, while on the lower red LED power setting you can expect to <strong>squeeze out about 200 hours</strong>, which is rather impressive. And the whole hing weighs just <strong>3.9 ounces, or 110 grams</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultra-headlamp\">Petzl Ultra Headlamp</a> - What the Ultra does best is brightness. On the <strong>maximum setting it will give you 350 lumens</strong>, which is enough to see about <strong>120 meters in front of you</strong>. Unfortunately it will only do that for about 2 hours, and will only get about <strong>17 hours of battery life on the lowest power setting</strong>. It's a headlamp built for one thing, and that's brightness. The <strong>batteries are rechargeable</strong>, however, so it's not like you're buying a new set every time you run it dry. The whole thing also <strong>weighs 12.1 ounces, or 346 grams</strong>, so not exactly light either.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/petzl-tactikka-plus-headlamp\">Petzl Tactikka Plus Headlamp</a> - One more very popular and highly rated headlamp. It's not particularly powerful, with just <strong>35 lumens</strong> at it's disposal on the highest power setting. But even on the high setting you get 100 hours of battery life, and a <strong>full 150 on the lowest power setting</strong>. It also has a little red lens that can flip down over the LEDs which gives you a red light mode to work with as well. But what stands out is that the whole thing <strong>weighs just 2.75 ounces, or 78 grams</strong>, which is rather lightweight.</li>

The <strong>best sleeping pad for camping</strong> will do a few things. First, it wont weigh too much, so that you don’t have to carry around a big, heavy sleeping pad. Second, a good sleeping pad for camping will keep you warm and comfortable at night. Everything else aside, if you are staring at the ceiling of your tent all night, then your sleeping pad is not doing its job properly.
<h2>Best Sleeping Pad for Camping</h2>
What to look at when you want the best sleeping pad for camping with.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Type</strong> – Sleeping pads come in two different varieties. First, there are foam sleeping pads, which are typically quite light, but also bulky and maybe not quite as comfortable as inflatable sleeping pads, which are the second, often heavier option for taking camping.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value</strong> – If you plan on going camping in the winter, or any time of the year when it’s cold, you are going to want a sleeping pad with a high R-value. The higher a sleeping<!--more--> pads R-value is, the more body heat it will reflect. In the winter, that reflected body heat can be difference between a chilly night and a nice, toasty warm night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Sleeping Pad for Camping Reviews</h2>
Reviews of a select few of the best sleeping pads for taking camping.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810386/therm-a-rest-ridgerest-solite-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest RidgeRest SOlite</a> - If you want the lightness and simplicity of a <strong>foam sleeping pad,</strong> then the SOlite is a great choice. It's <strong>.62 inches thick</strong>, but features ridges built in to the top of the sleeping pad, which helps to increase thickness, and thus comfort, without increasing the weight too much. It also has an <strong>aluminized surface, which helps to up the R-value to 2.8</strong>, a solid number for most three season outdoor adventures. All that in a <strong>14 ounce, or 396 gram package</strong>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - The NeoAir is the ideal <strong>inflatable sleeping pad</strong>. It's rectangular, so there's no shortage of square footage if you like to move around at night, and it's also <strong>2.5 inches thick</strong>, which is plenty of comfort. All that and it weighs just <strong>14 ounces, or 396 grams</strong>, making it just as light as the SOlite above, and a lot lighter than most other inflatable sleeping pads. It also has <strong>an R-value of 2.5</strong>, making it more than suitable for most three season use. It also <strong>won the 2009 Backpacker magazine Editor's Choice award</strong>. So lightweight and comfortable, which is about all you could hope for from a camping sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\">Exped DownMat 9</a> - The DownMat is definitely not light, at <strong>34.6 ounces, or 980 grams</strong>, but then it also has <strong>an R-value of 8</strong>, which is one of the highest on the market, and when you compare it to other sleeping pads with a similar R-value, that's a downright impressive weight. An R-value of 8 will <strong>keep you warm down to somewhere around -36</strong>, assuming your sleeping bag can go that low, and the DownMat manages that by using 700 fill down on the top of the sleeping pad, to provide you with plenty of insulation. Down is also how it manages to be so light in comparison to other four season sleeping pads, which mostly use foam for insulation. So if you're going camping in the winter, the best sleeping pad for you is something like the DownMat.</li>
