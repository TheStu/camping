<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Stoves?</h2>
A glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/stoves/\">list of lightweight stoves</a> page shows that there are some almost ridiculously light stoves on the market. The lightest stove, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gramcracker-titanium-solid-fuel-kit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Trail Designs GramCracker</a> comes in at an astonishing 3 grams. That's about half a gram more than a penny weighs. Not bad.

But the GramCracker is a tablet stove, which isn't the kind of stove that most people are looking for. So how light can you get when considering more conventional fuel sources, like canister stoves for instance? The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-ef-ii-stove-w-piezo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Primus Gravity EF II Stove</a> weighs in at 264 grams, or .6 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768603/snow-peak-litemax-stove\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snow Peak LiteMax Stove</a>, on the other hand, another canister stove, weighs in at just 53 grams, or .1 pounds....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Primus Gravity EF II Stove - 264 grams / .6 pounds
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Snow Peak LiteMax Stove - 53 grams / .1 pounds
</strong></li>
</ul>
The Snow Peak LiteMax is a sixth of the weight of the Primus Gravity EF II, and yet does the exact same thing. With a little careful planning, you can drastically reduce the weight of your backpack by considering options like lightweight stoves.
<h2>Common Features of Lightweight Stoves</h2>
There are a few common manufacturing features and techniques that you'll find on some of the more lightweight stoves.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Alcohol Stove </strong>- Take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/stoves/\">list of lightweight stoves</a> and you'll see that amazingly the 15 lightest stoves are all either alcohol stoves or tablet stoves. Alcohol stoves are extremely simple to manufacture, easy to use, and cheap, which makes them very popular with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts.  Keep in mind though that often what you're getting is a barebones stove that you'll need to augment with stands and windscreens to really make function well. Most alcohol stove manufacturers make these accessories, and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clikstand.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clikstand</a> is another popular manufacturer of said accessories.</li>
	<li><strong>Alternative Fuel Sources</strong> - More generally, forgoing conventional canister and liquid fuel stoves makes for a lighter stove, as the fuel usually weighs less. There's alcohol stoves, tablet stoves, and even wood stoves if you're backpacking somewhere forested. Considering the weight of the fuel and the fuel container should be part of your stove buying decision, which certainly makes wood stoves a more appealing alternative.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drawbacks of Lightweight Stoves</h2>
When going to a lightweight stove, most of the metal that gets trimmed would have otherwise gone to stabilizing whatever you've got on top of the stove. As I talked about above, you can always get different accessories for your stove that will help mitigate this, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having a lightweight stove. Like most pieces of lightweight backpacking equipment, the drawbacks come down more to lack of knowledge and experience than anything else. Picking a cooking spot on level ground and out of the wind, for instance, will go a long ways to reducing any stability problems you might have with a lightweight stove."

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Water Filters?</h2>
The big things in your backpack, the tents and sleeping bags, are obvious areas to reduce weight, but it's the smaller things, like water filters, where if you put a little work in and find the lightweight alternatives you can really reduce the weight or your backpack and practice lightweight backpacking.

There isn't a whole lot of variety in the water filter market, as a quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/water-filters/\">list of water filters</a> will show you, but that doesn't mean there aren't heavy and light water filters. Take for example the <a href=\"http://www.katadyn.com/caen/katadyn-products/products/katadynshopconnect/katadyn-water-filters-endurance-series-products/katadyn-combi-schwarz/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Katadyn Combi filter</a>, which is a pump filter that weighs a total of 580 grams, or 1.3 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hyperflow-water-filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR HyperFlow Filter</a>, on the other hand, is a comparable pump filters that weighs only 221 grams, or .5 pounds....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Katadyn Combi Filter - 580 grams / 1.3 pounds
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>MSR HyperFlow Filter - 221 grams / .5 pounds
</strong></li>
</ul>
The MSR HyperFlow filter manages to be more than half the weight of the heavier competition. There isn't a great deal of choice in the water filter market, but there are lightweight water filters available if you're willing to look for them.
<h2>The Features of Light Water Filters</h2>
Even though there aren't all that many water filters on the market to choose from, there are some innovative features that separate out the lightest water filters from the rest.
<ol>
	<li><strong>UV Water Filters</strong> - The UV Water Filter is a unique idea. The weights listed over on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/water-filters/\">list of water filters</a> page can be deceiving because they don't include the weight of the batteries, but even with the batteries included they should still be considered ultralight water filters. When considering a UV water filter, you should also be aware that the water isn't actually filtered, just purified. Meaning that when you dip your water bottle in some stagnant water and it comes up as cloudy, the UV water filter will neutralize all the cloudy stuff in there, but you're still ingesting all that cloudy stuff. A low tech solution to this is to use a shirt or bandana as a crude sort of filter. Not perfect, but it will do a decent job.</li>
	<li><strong>Chemical Water Treatment </strong>- Why take the filter at all? Using chemicals to kill everything in the bottle is an alternative water treatment method popular with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts, mainly because the chemicals weigh almost nothing. You can take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-miox-purifier-w-batteries\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR MIOX water purifier</a>, or check out some of the other <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camp-hike/water-treatment/water-filters-purification?water_treatment_type=3412\" rel=\"nofollow\">chemical treatment options</a> available. Keep in mind though that like UV Filters, you're not actually filtering your water, so watch out for the cloudy stuff.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Drawbacks of Light Water Filters</h2>
With most ultralight water filters, the most common problem you're going to run in to is the amount of water that can be pumped before the filter needs to be replaced. As you can see on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/water-filters/\">list of water filters</a>, there are some that can be used almost indefinitely without needing to replace anything, and this is because you can clean them yourself. With UV water filters, the most pressing problem is going to be the battery. For a short trip you probably wouldn't have to carry extra batteries, but on a longer trip that could be a problem that you run in to, and it's no fun carrying extra batteries.

And as mentioned above, UV Filters and chemical water treatments don't actually filter the water, and while this is an easy problem to fix, it's another hassle that you might not be interested in dealing with. In the end though, there's no perfect water filtering system, they all have their drawbacks."

<h2>The Benefits of Tarp Tents</h2>
The main benefit of using a tarp tent is the weight that can be saved by leaving your tent at home. Being enclosed at night has a few different benefits when you're in the wilderness, but leaving unnecessary weight at home is a benefit too. Like a lot of other pieces of lightweight gear, you have to weigh the options when choosing a tarp tent or a lightweight tent. Taking a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">list of tarp tents</a> though you can see that only a few tents manage to be under 500 grams, or 1.1 pounds. There are, however, a great many tarp tents that come in under 500 grams, or 1.1 pounds, so the weight you can save is in most cases going to be considerable.

Another benefit, or drawback depending on how you look at it, is the opportunity to be nice and close with nature at night. Depending on what climate you're in and the animals you may have to interact with at 3 in the morning, a tarp tent may or may not seem like a good idea, but there's little bad that can be said about going to sleep at night with the possibility of seeing the stars.
<h2>How to Use a Tarp Tent</h2>
Using a tarp tent isn't all that difficult, but like any other kind of shelter there's a little equipment that's required. If you backpack with <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-trekking-poles/\">trekking poles</a> it makes things easy, because you can use one or both trekking poles to form the peaks of a simple A-Frame with the tarp. Use stakes and rope if necessary to secure the corners of the tarp, and there you have your shelter. Alternatively, you can use a tree to tie the peaks of your structure to, or even use whatever wood there is lying around.

Another common shelter design you can make with a tarp tent is the lean to, where you use whatever's handy, be it trekking poles, sticks, or trees, to tie two corners up and have two staked to the ground, so that the tarp forms a lean to.

One more setup that you commonly see is to have the tarp tent staked down at all four corners and the middle of one of the long sides raised up by being tied to a trekking pole, tree, or handy stick. Really though it's a square piece of material, and can be used in a variety of different ways. It's just about what's convenient and what you can do with the materials you have.
<h2>The Poncho Tarp Tent</h2>
A popular piece of dual use gear is the poncho tarp tent. Ponchos are more or less rectangular pieces of waterproof fabric anyway, so it's an obvious way to give one piece of material two different roles. The poncho tarp tent will have a head hole somewhere near the center of the rectangle which can be closed up when the poncho needs to become a tarp tent. It's a great innovation, but just remember that you wont be able to have rain gear and a shelter at the same time. See the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/poncho-tarp\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Poncho Tarp</a> as an example.
<h2>Popular Tarp Tents</h2>
You can get a good look at the full breadth of the tarp tents currently on the market on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">list of tarp tents</a> page, but here are a few of the lighter, more popular ones that you're likely to see other people using.

Find out more about why you should consider shoes instead of boots.
<h3>Shoes Instead of Boots</h3>
This page is called backpacking shoes instead of backpacking boots because a shoe makes more sense than a boot in the lightweight backpacking philosophy. Boots are clunky, they weigh a lot, and almost always excessive for what you're doing. Shoes, on the other hand, are flexible, typically more breathable, and most importantly, lightweight.

But a lot of people have reservations about the idea of wearing a backpacking shoe rather than a backpacking boot. The common complaints are that there's no ankle support, they wont be waterproof, and they'll fall apart much faster.
<ul>
	<li>Let's start with <strong>ankle support</strong>. If you're carrying 50 pounds in your backpack then sure, ankle support might not be such a bad idea. But 10 pounds? It just isn't necessary. Your ankles aren't so weak that they're going to go out from under you at the first sign of a rock or a root. Trust in your ankles, they're good at what they do. (There are, it should be noted, some very light, well made backpacking boots with ankle support out there, including the <a href=\"http://store.mpgear.com/inov-8-roclite-288-gtx-hiking-boot.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8 Roclite 288 GTX</a>, the <a href=\"http://store.mpgear.com/roclite-370.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8 Roclite 370</a>, and the <a href=\"http://store.mpgear.com/inov-8-roclite-400-gtx-hiking-boot.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8 Roclite 400 GTX</a>.)</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong>. The only true waterproof footwear I've ever owned were mountaineering boots, and those are not the kind of boots you want to go hiking in if you can avoid it. Waterproof is in most cases relative. Hiking shoes will keep your feet dry up to a point, depending on the shoe, and backpacking boots will usually keep your feet dry longer than the shoes, but eventually no matter what you're wearing your feet will get wet. If you're desperate, the best solution to the waterproof problem is a pair of plastic grocery bags. Very low tech and very lightweight, and they get the job done. Those looking for a more high tech solution should take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/webservices/rei/DisplayStyle/688268\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rocky Gore Tex Socks</a>.</li>
	<li>It's true that a pair of shoes probably <strong>break down</strong> faster than a pair of backpacking boots. Of course the price reflects this, shoes for backpacking being a good deal cheaper than backpacking boots on average, so it's hard to say which you would spend more on in the long term. But by buying a well made pair of hiking shoes you can extend the life of them in to the 1000+ mile territory and at least get your moneys worth from them.</li>
</ul>
This should at least convince you that shoes for backpacking are a viable alternative to backpacking boots. But there are also things that backpacking shoes do better than backpacking boots.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathability</strong> is an important feature that is more common to shoes than to boots. Allowing your feet to breath, especially during hotter months and in hotter climates is hugely important to comfort and the durability of your feet. Moisture plays a part in all kinds of foot problems commonly experienced by backpackers, and allowing your feet to breath is a big help.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong>. This website is about weight, and there's no question that your average pair of shoes is going to be lighter than an average pair of boots. Weight on your feet isn't the same as weight on your back though, it's worse! See the next section for an explanation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1 Pound on Your Feet = 5 on Your Back</h3>
I've heard it said many times that 1 pound on your feet is equivalent to having 5 pounds in your backpack in terms of energy expenditure. Given that an average pair of backpacking boots can easily weigh above 2 pounds, that's like walking around with an extra 10 pounds in your backpack. Backpacking shoes on the other hand are more lightweight, many easily getting down to the .5 pound range. So instead of an extra 10 pounds on your back you would have a much more manageable 2.5 pounds with a pair of lightweight shoes.
<h3>Popular Backpacking Shoe Options</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://store.mpgear.com/search.aspx?manufacturer=62\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8</a> are well known for their excellent trail shoes. They've won a fair number of awards for their products and they're well liked by lightweight hikers for their shoes. One of the great features of Inov-8 shoes is that they allow you far more than other shoes to feel the ground through the soles and your feet to flex in response to the ground.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montrail-mens-footwear\" rel=\"nofollow\">Montrail</a> is another brand that makes shoes popular with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts. Their shoes are lightweight and designed to last a long time on the trail.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/brand/Vibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibram Five Fingers</a> are another lightweight backpacking shoe option that are gaining in popularity. They haven't been on the market for all that long so it's unclear whether they're a fad or if they're here to stay, but I've used them while backpacking and enjoyed the experience so I think they should be included here.</li>

The frameless backpack is one of the better ideas to come out of lightweight hiking, and is also one of the few lightweight innovations that is off limits to most conventional hikers. But tweaking the contents of your backpack can make you eligible for a frameless backpack too.
<h2>Frameless Backpacks 101</h2>
When you were in school and you carried your books and your lunch around, did you have a frame in your backpack? Probably not. And yet in most hiking backpacks the frame is a default. In some it's not even removable. You've got a frame and you're going to like it. So why have a frame at all? The answer is weight. With sixty or seventy pounds stuffed in and hanging off of your backpack, a frame is a necessity. With that much weight and no frame the backpack starts to get lumpy and shifts around on you while you're wearing it, and doesn't keep its shape so well. It becomes an aggravation.

The trick then is to lighten your backpack so that you're practicing lightweight backpacking. Most frameless backpacks can handle about thirty pounds before they start to suffer from being too heavy, so you want to aim for a baseweight (everything you're going to carry minus the food and water) of fifteen or even ten pounds to be on the safe side.

I wont spend much time on the how of lightening your backpack because this whole website is about having a lighter backpack. I would suggest you take a look around, particularly at the gear lists (up top under gear lists on the menu) to get some ideas on how to lighten your backpack's contents. If you're still stuck for ideas after that try the sample <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-backpacking-gear-list/\">lightweight backpacking gear list</a>.

The great thing about lightening your backpack is that when you've finally gotten the contents of your backpack light enough to switch over to a frameless backpack you do that and your weight drops by another pound or more. That's because those frames are heavy, sometimes very heavy, and the difference in weight between a frameless backpack and a frame backpack can sometimes be shocking. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">lightweight backpacks list</a> to compare for yourself.
<h2>Popular Frameless Backpacks</h2>
A glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">lightweight backpacks list</a> will reveal just how many frameless backpacks there are on the market, but here are a few of the more popular ones...
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - ULA is well known in the lightweight backpacking community for a reason. They're almost exclusively a backpack manufacturer and they do what they do well.

<strong>To see the offerings of all of the different tent brands on the market head over to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>.</strong>

Tents really are one of the more important pieces of gear in your backpack, especially in the fall, winter, and spring months. Below I've listed a few good tent brands that come up often as making a quality, lightweight tent, but the tent market is huge and it would be difficult to do justice to it here. Over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a> page you can see the entirety of the market, and if you're looking to go lighter check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">lightweight tarp tents list</a>.
<h3>Best Tent Brands List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Tarptent</strong> - Despite the name, this tent brand actually makes tents and not<a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-tents/\"> tarps</a>, though it would be easy to confuse Tarptent products for tarps at first glance. They make mostly single wall tents that use trekking poles or single poles for support, have a big product line and are very popular with the lightweight backpacking crowd. One of their more popular products is the <a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contrail</a>, a one person tent that weighs in at 696 g, or 1.53 lbs.</li>
	<li><strong>Terra Nova</strong> - Holders of the Guinness world record for lightest double wall shelter in the world for their <a href=\"http://www.terra-nova.co.uk/Product_Type/Tents/Superlite_Tents/Laser_Ultra_1_Tent.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laser Ultra 1</a> (Take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a> to see if it's true), Terra Nova is a tent brand that knows how to make a lightweight tent. If the Cuben Fiber of the Laser Ultra 1 isn't your thing check out their more conventional <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-photon-1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laser Photon 1</a>, which is a one person tent that weighs in at 670 g, or 1.47 lbs.</li>
	<li><strong>MSR</strong> - A more conventional tent brand, MSR makes a few lightweight tents, though nothing that would threaten Terra Nova's Guiness record. Their <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/carbon-reflex-1-tent-1-person-3-seas\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carbon Reflex 1</a> is a one person tent that weighs 970 g, or 2.13 lbs, and a good example of the MSR tent brand's product line.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Agnes</strong> - With one of the larger product lines in the tent market, Big Agnes is a tent brand with something for everyone, including lightweight backpacking enthusiasts. To get an idea of what Big Agnes' tents look like check out the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fly Creek UL 1</a>, which is a one person tent that weighs in at 850 g, or 1.87 lbs.</li>

It would be difficult to go backpacking without a backpack. And there's no sense in having a heavy backpack when you could have a lightweight backpack instead. Below I've listed several good backpack brands that are popular with lightweight backpackers and that are known to make a good, quality product. This short list of backpack brands is by no means a complete one though. In fact the backpacking market is full of different backpacking brands and it would be impossible to do justice to it here, but over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">lightweight backpacks list</a> you can see the entirety of the backpacks market on one page.
<h3>Best Backpack Brands List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>ULA Equipment</strong> - An extremely popular backpack brand with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts, ULA Equipment makes an excellent product that balances weight with durability and a few innovative design features too. One example being the <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/ohm.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">OHM</a>, a great backpack that weighs in at 640 g, or 1.4 lbs.</li>
	<li><strong>Gossamer Gear</strong> - Another very popular backpack brand with the lightweight backpacking crowd. Gossamer Gear has been building quality lightweight backpacks for a number of years now and they've built up a following and a reputation for quality. A good example of their product line is the <a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/mariposa-plus-ultralight-backpack.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mariposa</a>, a backpack that weighs 632 g, or 1.4 lbs.</li>
	<li><strong>GoLite</strong> - This backpack brand has been going more and more mainstream, and the weights of some of their backpacks have been creeping up as they've done so. Regardless of weight though, they make good quality backpacks and are still a popular choice for lightweight backpacking enthusiasts. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/jam-pack-3050-cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jam</a> is one of their more popular backpacks, and weighs 840 g, or 1.85 lbs.</li>
	<li><strong>Mountain Laurel Design</strong> - Another of the backpack brands that is popular with lightweight backpackers but largely unknown to the average backpacker. That could change though, as Mountain Laurel Designs won the Reader's Choice Award for Best Ultralight Backpack in 2011. The winning backpack was the <a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=103\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus</a>, a great backpack that weighs just 425 g, or .94 lbs.</li>

<h2>Poncho Tarp Tents</h2>
The poncho tarp tent, the combination of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-tents/\">tarp tent</a> and poncho, is one of the better ideas to come out of lightweight backpacking. The idea of combining both your shelter, which can weigh a lot, and your rain gear, which can also weight a lot, in to one lightweight package is an excellent way to save weight. Often the best use of a poncho tarp tent is in situations where a shelter and / or rain gear is unlikely to be needed. It gives you the security of having both while freeing up a considerable amount of weight and room in your backpack.
<h2>Poncho Tarp Tent Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li>The typical poncho tarp tent is a square or rectangular cut piece of fabric, often Spinnaker but any kind of lightweight waterproof fabric will do.</li>
	<li>In tarp mode the head hole must be closeable in some way, and usually the corners will have tie outs so that the poncho tarp tent can be staked down or tied to something to form the tarp. Lightweight backpacking enthusiasts will often use their <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-trekking-poles/\">trekking poles</a> to help create the structure of the tarp tent, but anything from a handy tree to a piece of dead-fall can be used as a stand in.</li>
	<li>In poncho mode the poncho tarp tent functions much like a typical poncho. Depending on how wide it is it may or may not give very good weather protection to the lower arms. One of the bonuses of a poncho tarp tent though is that there's plenty of fabric to drape over your backpack, which means you can protect your backpack from the weather Not having your rain gear pinned between your backpack and your back means that air can circulate better too, keeping sweating to a minimum.</li>
	<li>There's no reason that you can't use a poncho tarp tent in bad weather, but the caveat that always goes along with this innovative piece of equipment is that it can't be both a shelter and a piece of rain gear at the same time. In other words if your shelter is set up and you're going for water, cooking, and anything else while it's raining you're going to get wet. As a safety net though the poncho tarp tent is an ideal piece of equipment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Best Backpacks</h2>
Best backpack for backpacking is a tricky idea, but I've judged best to be based on several things including weight, reputation, and features, and I've divided things up in to a few categories to help you find the kind of backpack that you're looking for.
<h2>Best Backpacks - Frameless</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - If you've spent any time around lightweight backpackers you've probably heard about ULA Equipment. Unlike many lightweight manufacturers that dabble in a few different things ULA is focused almost 100% on backpacks, and that focus comes through in their products. The CDT is light and low capacity, perfect for those going lightweight backpacking and a serious contender for best backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/jam-pack-3050-cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Jam</a> - The Jam is not a new backpack by any means. It's been around for a long time and has gone through a few evolutions in the process. The latest version of this lightweight backpack is a touch heavier than some of its predecessors but the new weight is arguably worth it for a better backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-35-lightweight-backpack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser 35</a> - The Laser is a bit of a stand out. Unlike most backpacks it's a front loader, meaning that you have easy access to everything in your backpack, so if front loaders appeal to you definitely consider the Laser. It's made by a UK company not well known in North America, but with a well deserved reputation of quality in the UK.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/g4-ultralight-backpack-63.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear G4 Ultralight</a> - The G4 is a lightweight backpacks that, like the Jam, has been around for awhile and has been through a few design tweaks in the process that could put it up there as best backpack in the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/frameless-backpacks/\">frameless backpacks</a> category. And it's made by Gossamer Gear, another well known name in the lightweight backpacking community that you wont be disappointed with.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=103\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain Laurel Designs Exodus</a> - The Exodus by MLD won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine award in 2011 for Readers Choice of Best Ultralight Backpack</strong>. Like the other frameless backpacks on this list it's well known and well loved by the lightweight backpacking community.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacks - Frames</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - The Circuit is similar to the CDT from the frameless list above, the difference between the two being a lightweight frame and a larger carrying capacity for the Circuit, making it an ideal lightweight backpack for those looking to go lightweight with a frame backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-atmos-50-backpack-2868-3234cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osprey Atmos 50</a> - While not as light as the Circuit or the Mariposa below, the Atmos is a sturdy frame backpack made by one of the better known brand names in the backpacking world. It's also very popular and well liked by the backpacking community, and makes a fine choice for those not as concerned about weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824361/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/824384/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60-ki-pack-womens\">Women's version</a>)- The Blaze A.C. 60 is a new backpack for 2011 from Granite Gear. It's made a big impression quick, grabbing top honors from the Backpacker Magazine Awards for Editor's Choice of Best Backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/mariposa-plus-ultralight-backpack.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa</a> - Gossamer Gear is another backpack manufacturer that focuses on making a durable yet lightweight backpack, and the Mariposa fits that description well. Gossamer Gear backpacks are common with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts out on the trail and the Mariposa is one of their most popular backpacks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best Backpacks - High Capacity</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/catalyst.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Catalyst</a> - It's no mistake that ULA has a backpack in each of these three categories. They make some of the best backpacks out there. They make an excellent product, and while the Catalyst is on the smaller side of the backpacks in the high capacity list it also weighs far less, and if weight is a concern the Catalyst is probably the backpack for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/argon-110-pack-6900-cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osprey Argon 110</a> - Osprey makes a whole line of Argon bags, including a 70, and 85, and the 110. If your best backpack is the one with the capacity to carry all your gear, it's difficult to match up with this backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-bora-95-backpack-5250-6040cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arc'teryx Bora 95</a> - The Bora 95 is another top of the line backpack. You wont be saving on weight with this one, but it's got all the features and capacity to carry a wide variety of gear, and if you need the space to carry all your gear definitely consider the Bora 95.</li>

<h2>Best Sleeping Bags</h2>
The best possible sleeping bag for backpacking is a hard idea to get an exact definition of, but with this list I've tried to go by a few key things like weight, reputation, reviews, and features. I've also split things up in to a few different categories to help you find the ideal sleeping bag.
<h3>Best Winter Sleeping Bags</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-bison-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-40-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western Mountaineering Bison GWS</a> - Western Mountaineering is known for making excellent, lightweight products, and though the Bison GWS is rated down to -40 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit (and Celsius too) it still manages to be one of the lighter -40 sleeping bags on the market.</span></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell Super Spiral Down EXP</a> - Mont Bell is a Japanese manufacturer that sticks mainly to producing down products, both sleeping bags and clothing, and they make some of the better sleeping bags on the market. The Super Spiral Down EXP has one of their lowest temperature ratings, coming in at a temperature rating of -20 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit. This sleeping bag combines a lot of the innovative features you often see from Mont Bell to be seriously stand out lightweight sleeping bag.</span></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.summithut.com/products/ap-iii-4-degree-down-sleeping-bag/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit AP III</a> - The AP III isn't as warm as the other sleeping bags in this category, being rated down only to -4 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit, but it's a very well designed sleeping bag, and the 850+ down fill means you save on weight, so if you're not planning on needing the extra insulation of a warmer winter sleeping bag then the AP III would be an ideal choice.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Summer Sleeping Bags</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-5-bag-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down #5</a> - An 800+ down fill bag good down to 40 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit</span>, so that you get all the warmth necessary without any of the extra weight that comes with the lower quality down normally found in summer sleeping bags. The U.L. Super Spiral Down #5 also has many of the innovative features you typically see on Mont Bell's sleeping bags, making it an excellent, lightweight choice for a summer sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - The Highlite is another very light summer sleeping bag from Western Mountaineering, who make some of the best sleeping bags you'll find anywhere. It uses 850+ fill down, and features box baffling to keep the down from moving around too much as well as the stand out purple fabric. The Highlite will keep you comfortable down to 35 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit.</span></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.summithut.com/products/mc-ii-36-degree-down-sleeping-bag/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit: Mc II</a> - You can tell right away by looking at the MC II that it's probably not for everyone. The thin design means that bigger people would probably be more than a little snug zipped up in it. But for the slimmer people out there the streamlined design, the 850+ fill down and the 36 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit temperature rating and the ability to convert it to a quilt on the fly will make it an ideal choice for saving weight while summer backpacking.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Quilt Sleeping Bags</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.nunatakusa.com/site07/arc_products/arc_specialist.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nunatak Arc Specialist</a> - Nunatak is without a doubt the most well known brand name when it comes to <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-quilts/\">backpacking quilts</a>. They make some of the better sleeping bag quilts available and use excellent materials, occasionally even offering 900+ fill down for their products. The Arc Specialist is an excellent 32 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit </span>quilt but if you're looking for a quilt consider just about anything from their product line.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://katabaticgear.com/shop/sawatch-sleeping-bag/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Katabatic Sawatch</a> - Katabatic is less well known than some of the more established brands on this page, but with some good reviews, quality materials and clearly well thought out designs you should seriously consider them when looking at quilts. The Sawatch is a 15 <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: 18px; color: #000000;\">Fahrenheit sleeping bag and a serious contender in the quilts category.</span></li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.jacksrbetter.com/Wearable%20Quilts.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jacks R Better Stealth</a> - Called the Swiss Army Knife of sleeping bags by Backpacker magazine, the Stealth is an excellent piece of gear.

<h2>Best Tents</h2>
Selecting the tents that are best for backpacking is tricky idea, but with this list I've decided that best is a combination of a few things including weight, reputation, reviews, and features. I've also divided the selected tents up in to a few categories to make it easier to find exactly what you're looking for.
<h2>Best 1 Person Tents</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/shelters/shelters/the-one.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear The One</a> - The One lives up to its name. It's unique and extremely lightweight design puts it at #2 in terms of weight on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>, making it one of the better tents on the market. It's also a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-trekking-poles/\">trekking pole</a> tent, so it works best if you're one of those people who carry trekking poles. Otherwise you have to bring your own pole.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is one of many tents from Tarp Tent designer Henry Shires. The Contrail and all the rest of Shires' tents are very popular with the lightweight backpacking community, and just about any of his tents are serious contenders for the title of top tent. The Contrail is a single wall tent and features the venting around the bottom that is common to much of the Tarp Tent product line.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-elite-tent-1-p-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon 1</a> - Terra Nova is a less well known lightweight backpacking manufacturer from the U.K. They make some very lightweight products though, and unlike the other two tents on this list the Laser Photon 1 is a two wall rather than a single wall tent. Despite this the weight remains extremely low due to the excellent design and this tent definitely deserves consideration as one of the best possible tents for one.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Best 2 Person Tents</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/squall2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Squall 2</a> - Another tent from the very popular manufacturer Tarp Tent, the Squall 2 is basically the same very innovative single wall design as the Contrail but with room for two. It also uses two trekking poles for support, but remains very lightweight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/796087/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul2-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2</a> - The Fly Creek UL 2 is much more of a traditional tent design than the other two tents on this list. Despite that it manages to remain very lightweight and be a popular choice for lightweight backpacking enthusiasts, making it a contender for top tents.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Tent</a> - Another tent from the UK manufacturer.

<h2>Best Camping Stoves</h2>
A stove is an important piece of equipment to have with you when you're in the outdoors. A hot meal is often the perfect thing after a long, hard day on the trail. Sitting there, watching the water not boil is never any fun, however, so when you go backpacking you want to bring along the very best backpacking, so that you can spend less time watching your food cook and get to the eating part faster.
<h3>Best Camping Stove Features</h3>
Here are a few features you will commonly find on the best camping stoves and best backpacking stoves.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - Stoves have a tendency to weigh a lot more than they should. Especially for the backpackers out there, the best camping stove is going to be a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-stoves/\">lightweight stove</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Fuel Choice</strong> - Another important consideration when picking out the best camping stove or best backpacking stove is the fuel. There are pros and cons for any fuel. The best backpacking stove fuel type, for instance, will probably be liquid, refillable fuel containers because they are refillable, whereas canisters are generally not refillable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Camping Stoves List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gramcracker-titanium-solid-fuel-kit\" rel=\"nofollow\">TrailDesigns Gramcracker</a> - If weight is your main criteria for best camping stoves then look no further than the Gramcracker. Weighing a scant 3 grams it's probably the lightest piece of equipment you'll carry. The stove uses tablets as a fuel source which are lightweight themselves.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/768603/snow-peak-litemax-stove\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snow Peak LiteMax Titanium</a> - If weight is your chief criteria for choosing from among the best camping stoves but you want a more common fuel source then consider the LiteMax Titanium. It's one of the lightest canister stoves on the market, is made by a well respected stove manufacturer and is well reviewed as well. A great choice for best camping stove.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-simmerlite-stove\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Simmerlite</a> - The Simmerlite is another very lightweight stove that uses Liquids as a fuel source. If you're looking for a stove to fit your liquid fuel bottles while not taking up much weight then consider the Simmerlite as the best backpacking stove for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/titanium-hexagon-wood-stove\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vargo Titanium Hexagon</a> - The lightest fuel of all is the fuel that you don't have to carry with you. The Hexagon uses wood as a fuel source, so you use what you find and pack up just your stove when you leave camp in the morning.

<strong>A winter hiking excursion is a great way to enjoy a day in the snow or just a sunny winter day. Before setting out on a winter hike, however, there are a few things you should keep in mind to both enjoy yourself and stay safe.</strong>

One is that winter weather is always unpredictable, and if you are going to be hiking for a long period of time, all day or even overnight, then you need to go winter hiking prepared for a few possibilities, such as the weather turning ugly on you. Summer hiking is a lot more forgiving than winter hiking, and people often underestimate just how ugly things can get when the weather turns bad. Snow storms, wind storms and generally cold temperatures can mean that your gear requirements are a lot different than a summer stroll.

And speaking of gear, there are a few winter hiking equipment possibilities that you might consider taking along to enhance your fun on a winter hike. The environment changes rather drastically in the winter, and snow on the trail, for instance, can present an opportunity to enjoy the outdoors in a different way.
<h3>Winter Hiking Equipment</h3>
Here are a few likely winter hiking gear choices that you should consider bringing with you when going hiking in cold temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - When winter hiking it is important to ensure that you can always be warm, and that means taking along insulating layers to work with your other layers. Just because you're taking along insulating layers, however, that doesn't mean you have to weight down your backpack with all kinds of heavy gear. Mont Bell makes an excellent <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\">down inner jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down inner pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>) that are ideal for winter hiking. They weigh very little and pack down to almost nothing, but will keep you nice and warm in a pinch.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/search?cat=4500648\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunglasses</a> - You might not think it, but a pair of sunglasses can really come in handy when out winter hiking. Sun reflecting off the snow can cause snow blindness, which can be dangerous if you are by yourself. Also consider taking along some <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/search?cat=4500001_Health%20and%20Safety&amp;cat=4500068&amp;hist=cat%2C4500001_Health+and+Safety%3AHealth+and+Safety^cat%2C4500068%3ASun+Protection&amp;crt=%28attribute_value_nested%3Dcat_4500001%3D%28+Category_x3A__x20_Health_x20_and_x20_Safety%29%28+cat_4500001%29%28+_x34_500001_Health_x20_and_x20_Safety%29%29%28attribute_value_nested%3Dcat_8000%3D%28+Category_x3A__x20_Camping_x20__x26__x20_Hiking%29%28+cat_8000%29%28+_x34_500001%29%29%28attribute_value_nested%3Dcategory_root%3D%28+Category_x3A__x20_REI%29%28+category_root%29%28+_x38_000%29%29%28free_text%3D%3D%28+Sun_x20_and_x20_Bug_x20_Protection%29%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">sunscreen</a> for the same reason.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - It pays to bring along a pair of winter hiking boots, especially if you are planning to go on an all day hike. Keeping for feet dry and warm is paramount to not only enjoying yourself in the outdoors but staying safe as well.</li>
	<li><strong>Outer Layers</strong> - A good waterproof outer layer is important. You should have a jacket at least, and a pair of pants wouldn't be a bad idea either, especially if you are heading in to the snow. Look for a waterproof fabric that will breath as well, such as GoreTex or eVent.</li>
	<li><strong>Overnight Gear</strong> - If there is a possibility that your day hike will turn in to a backpacking trip, then it would be a good idea to bring along a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">winter sleeping bag</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">winter tent</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">winter sleeping pad</a>. Staying warm overnight when winter hiking is critical, and if there is a chance you will be spending the night outdoors you should not leave home without a few essentials.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - If you plan to get in to some fresh snow while out winter hiking then a pair of hiking snowshoes might be a great idea. Snowshoes will save you some energy and also let you experience the outdoors in a new way.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Reasons to go Winter Hiking</h3>
Winter hiking has more dangers associated with it than summer hiking does, but there is a definite benefit to going winter hiking, which is the opportunity to experience the outdoors in a whole new way.

There are different animals out and about in the winter months. There are also a lot of very different things that can only be seen in the winter months, like frozen lakes and snow covered mountains.

One of the best reasons to go winter hiking, however, has to be that there are far less people out with you. Summer hiking can feel a bit claustrophobic sometimes with all the people that go out to enjoy the outdoors, but winter hiking can be a very solitary experience."

<h2>Sleeping Bag Brands</h2>
The sleeping bag market is a big one. There are a lot of good sleeping bag brands out there making excellent products and hoping for your business.

I've included information on some of the more popular brands below, but it's impossible to do justice to such a big market without a bigger picture. Check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">lightweight sleeping bags list</a> to get an idea of what else is being offered by the various sleeping bag manufacturers.
<h3>Best Sleeping Bag Brands</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Western Mountaineering</strong> - Without a doubt one of the most popular sleeping bag manufacturers on the market. Western Mountaineering is a big brand that makes a lot of lightweight sleeping bags, which is a rare occurrence. They offer almost thirty different sleeping bags in a whole range of temperature ratings and styles, but if you want to see what their products look like I would suggest taking a look at the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Highlite</a>, a 35 F summer bag that weighs in at 455 g, or 1 lb.</li>
	<li><strong>Nunatak</strong> - Makers of a niche product as far as sleeping bags go, Nunatak makes <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-quilts/\">quilt sleeping bags</a> almost exclusively, and are known for making an excellent sleeping bag. Sleeping bag quilts aren't for everyone, but if you think they might be for you it would be hard to do better than Nunatak. To get an idea of what their product line is like check out their <a href=\"http://www.nunatakusa.com/site07/arc_products/arc_ghost.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arc Ghost</a>, a 32 F summer bag that weighs just 453 g, or 1 lb.</li>
	<li><strong>Mont Bell</strong> - A Japanese sleeping bag brand with a big presence in North America, they make excellent lightweight sleeping bags that are popular with lightweight backpackers. As an example of their product line take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-5-bag-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">U.L Super Spiral Down #5</a>, a 40 F summer sleeping bag that weighs in at 453 g, or 1 lb.</li>
	<li><strong>Mountain Hardwear</strong> - Another large outdoor gear brand that makes a few lightweight sleeping bags, Mountain Hardwear has over thirty sleeping bags to choose from, and so there's something for everyone. The <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795978\" rel=\"nofollow\">Phantom</a> is a good example of one of their more lightweight products. It's a 32 F sleeping bag that weighs in at just 640 g, or 1.4 lbs.</li>

It's about lightweight backpacking, about ditching every redundant, too-heavy, useless piece of gear in your backpack and finding lighter replacements for the few pieces of gear that you actually do need, so that you can embrace lightweight backpacking. The goal is to get the base weight of your pack, that is the weight of everything minus what you're wearing, food, and water, to under ten pounds.

<p>Food is going to be one of the heaviest things in a backpack, and also one of the things that you have a great deal of control over. Your food weight can vary by pounds per day, depending on what kind of things you pack. The most common advice you&#39;ll get on trail nutrition is, basically, to pack heavy on carbs and sugars, the thinking being that these foods are light per calorie, readily available, and tasty.</p>
<p>But what about fat? There&#39;s a good case to be made that fat is perfectly healthy for you (if you want to learn more about this, see <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bmb.2005.494033022445/full\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>&nbsp;(in-depth), <a href=\"http://www.crossfitoakland.com/archives/2010/04/free-cfj-video-lecture-series\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>&nbsp;(video), <a href=\"http://videomedia2.swedish.org/mediasite/SilverlightPlayer/Default.aspx?peid=cd8c7aa15bc94a0486f4ee9b66ef8f8f\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>&nbsp;(video), <a href=\"http://www.motherearthnews.com/print-article.aspx?id=139058\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35058896/ns/health-heart_health/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.spiked-online.com/Articles/0000000CAE78.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>), and besides, fats will often have as much as twice the calories per unit of weight that carbs do. In the interest of going light, fat really is the best option.</p>
<p>Taking fats on the trail with you doesn&#39;t have to mean bringing along a hunk of butter (though clarified butter is supposed to keep very well), there are many tasty options that are full of fat...</p>
<h3>Trail Foods List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trail Mix - </strong>By far the easiest way to get a lot of fat calories on to the trail with you. It&#39;s an easy thing to carry and to eat and it tastes good too. Best of all, there are countless different varieties and combinations to choose from so that you never get bored with it.</li>
	<li><strong>Peanut Butter -&nbsp;</strong>Another good option, or any kind of nut butter really (Peanuts aren&#39;t actually nuts, they&#39;re beans). Peanut Butter goes great on a whole variety of things, and is good on its own too, straight from the jar on a finger.</li>
	<li><strong>Energy Bar - </strong>If you&#39;re willing to shop around a bit, and possibly spend a bit more, you can find some great energy bars that are fat heavy and carb light, rather than carb heavy and fat light, which characterizes your typical energy bar. Of course, there&#39;s no reason you cant <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-energy-bar-redux/\" rel=\"nofollow\">make your own</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Pemmican - </strong>Of course, there is always the original trail food, pemmican. Pemmican is a combination of dried meat, fat, and sometimes berries, and originated with the Native Americans but was used widely by early settlers and as well as arctic adventurers because of its excellent weigh to calorie ratio and its long shelf life. A quick google search will show you where it&#39;s sold, but again, there&#39;s nothing wrong with <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/how-to-make-pemmican/\" rel=\"nofollow\">making your own</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Cheese - </strong>Shelf lives will vary depending on the type(hard cheeses typically last longer), but cheese can be a very tasty addition to a trail food bag, and goes great with a whole range of different meal options.</li>
	<li><strong>Butter - </strong>Perhaps not as a stand alone food item, but certainly as part of a meal, butter is a great option, and can be added to just about anything, from soup to pasta sauce to rehydrated eggs.</li>
	<li><strong>Olive Oil - </strong>Similar to butter, this probably isn&#39;t something you&#39;re going to be eating on its own, but again, it tastes good in a lot of different common trail foods, and will improve the calorie to weight ratio of any meal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are a few of the different options available. You can see some more <a href=\"http://www.marksdailyapple.com/primal-trail-food/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>&nbsp;(check out the comments for a lot of great ideas). As you can see high fat snacks are easy, and there are different things that you can add to breakfast or dinner that will give you a lot of calories for a little weight, and will taste good too.</p>
<p>The thing you want to keep in mind with all of this is weight. By using fat as much as possible, you&#39;re going to significantly reduce your backpack weight, and have a lot more fun as a result. You&#39;ll also burn fewer calories by carrying less food weight, which means you wont have to carry as much food. It&#39;s all interconnected.</p>
<p>And don&#39;t think this is small differences either. A few simple choices can give you the same amount of calories for a pound or even two less in weight. On a five day trip that could be anywhere from five to ten pounds of weight that you&#39;re not carrying on the first day, which definitely isn&#39;t nothing.</p>

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Backpacks?</h2>
The backpack is part of the trio known as the the 'Big Three'. Together with the Sleeping Bag and the Tent, it's one of the three heaviest things you'll carry while backpacking. <strong>For that reason, considering lightweight backpacks is important if you want to practice lightweight backpacking. </strong>

And there is quite a difference in weights when it comes to backpacks, as can be seen over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">list of backpacks</a>. Consider the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-demon-backpack-1953-2197cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Demon backpack</a>. It's a 34 Liter backpack that weighs in at 1230 grams, or 2.7 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT backpack</a> though, another 34 Liter backpack, weighs just 481 grams, or 1.1 pounds.....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Black Diamond Demon - 1230 / 2.7 pounds </strong></li>
	<li><strong>ULA Equipment CDT - 481 / 1.1 pounds </strong></li>
</ul>
The ULA Equipment CDT is just a few ounces shy of being only a third the weight of the heavier Black Diamond Demon, a backpack that has roughly the same features and capabilities of the lighter backpack. Like any other piece of gear, lightweight manufacturers know how to make ultralight backpacks that cut all the right corners.
<h2>The Features of Light Backpacks</h2>
There are a few features that are fairly common among the lightest backpacks.
<ol>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/frameless-backpacks/\"><strong>Frameless Backpacks </strong></a>- Most people consider an internal frame to be one of the essential features of a backpack. And the way most people go backpacking, a frame really is necessary. Generally, when you get above a total backpack weight of 25 or 30 pounds, a frame is the only thing that's going to give your backpack the rigidity it needs to be carried comfortably. But if you're practicing lightweight backpacking and your pack weighs less than that, a frame isn't necessary, and you can consider frameless backpacks. Taking out the frame, it should be noted, is one of the best ways to lighten your backpack. (You can compare frameless backpacks and internal frame backpacks at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">list of backpacks</a>.)</li>
	<li><strong>Lightweight Materials </strong>- A great deal of the weight savings seen in light backpacks come from the manufacturer's choice of material. Cuben Fiber (seen on many <a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPacks</a> products), for instance, is an extremely lightweight fabric. The drawback is that it is gradually degraded by sunlight, and rips relatively easily, so long term, it's not a great choice (Though the prices of most cuben fiber packpacks are low, so replacing is no great loss). But that doesn't mean you need the heavy duty stuff that many manufacturers use either. A popular middle-ground fabric is Dyneema. Dyneema backpacks are strong, don't rip easily, and are lightweight. <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/index.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment</a> is a popular manufacturer of Dyneema backpacks, but you'll find a lot of the light backpack manufacturers use it.</li>
	<li><strong>No Lid </strong>- Many ultralight backpacks forgo the lid and have what is called a roll top closure (The <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> for instance). While not as weather proof as the more traditional lid, you'll probably be using a bag liner anyway (garbage bags work nicely) so it's kind of a moot point.</li>
	<li><strong>Top Access Backpacks </strong>- Many backpacks have a sleeping bag compartment at the bottom of the bag, from which you can also sometimes access whatever's at the bottom of the main compartment. Some backpacks also have zippers running down the side of the backpack or even the front, to allow you access to the main compartment without having to dig. But zippers are heavy, and if you're bringing so much stuff that you need all sorts of access ports, you're probably bringing too much. Most lightweight backpacks forgo these additional access ports, though not all (The <a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/camino.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Camino</a> is a front loading backpack).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drawbacks of Light Backpacks</h2>
There aren't too many drawbacks with using the lightest backpacks. Some people will be squeamish with not having an internal frame, but if you're not carrying that much a frame is nothing but extra weight. It should also be said that some light backpack manufacturers sell frames as an option on their backpacks (<a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPacks</a> and <a href=\"http://sixmoondesigns.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Six Moon Designs</a> for instance), and there are some very light backpacks with frames on the market (see the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">list of backpacks</a> to find them)

The only other problem you might encounter with ultralight backpacks is the chance of a rip. This will be more or less of a problem depending on the fabric that your backpack is made from, but unless you're doing some serious bush whacking or choose something like cuben fiber, you don't have much to worry about."

Point and shoot cameras are the top backpacking cameras because they're lightweight and small, much lighter than the larger DSLRs, and they're generally less sensitive to all the different weather you might find while hiking and backpacking. The only thing that a larger, heavier camera will do better is take better quality pictures.

But with that in mind, here are a few point and shoots that not only weigh very little but also take great outdoor pictures. They're probably among the better backpacking cameras you can find.
<h2>Best Backpacking Cameras List</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WJR69E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scrowed-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003WJR69E\" rel=\"nofollow\">Panasonic Lumix LX5</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003WJR69E&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - The Panasonic Lumix LX5 weighs in at just 277 grams, or 9.8 ounces, and is small enough to fit in a large pocket or a hip belt pocket. It has a 3.8x optical zoom, which is fantastic for getting the best pictures in the outdoors. It also gets 400 pictures per battery charge, which means you can probably leave the extra batteries at home, which saves on weight. It also works well in a variety of lighting situations, which is ideal for when you just want to take a picture and keep going down the trail.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZSHNGS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scrowed-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003ZSHNGS\" rel=\"nofollow\">Canon PowerShot S95</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003ZSHNGS&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - The Canon Powershot S95 is one of the better possible backpacking cameras you can get. First, it weighs only 173 grams, or 6.1 ounces, which is next to nothing for a camera. It also has a 3.8x optical zoom. The Powershot S95 is also small enough that it fits comfortably in your pants pocket, and wouldn't take up much room in a hip belt pocket. It has an easy to use menu and makes an excellent backpacking camera, especially if weight and size are big concerns.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004HO59LK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scrowed-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=B004HO59LK\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olympus XZ-1</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B004HO59LK&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - The Olympus XZ-1 is another of the excellent backpacking cameras on the market right now. It weighs in at 499 grams, or 1.1 pounds, so it isn't as lightweight as some of the other point and shoots on the market. However, it makes up for the extra weight with superior picture quality as compared to the LX5 or the S95, so if the best possible backpacking camera for you is the one with the best picture quality, then consider the XZ-1.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003AOAXL4/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=scrowed-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=B003AOAXL4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Panasonic Lumix G2</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B003AOAXL4&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - The Panasonic Lumix G2 is not a point and shoot, but it never the less makes an excellent backpacking camera. First, it weighs just 593 grams, or 20.9 ounces, which isn't much more than the XZ-1 above. The larger body and lens, however, mean that it wont be a pocket camera, and you will probably need a case for it. It is still much smaller, however, than the average DSLR, and retains the image quality of a DSLR, which point and shoots just cannot touch. If you're looking for image quality and don't mind the extra weight and bulk, then the G2 is probably the best backpacking camera for you.</li>

<strong>Tarp Camping is an excellent way to cut down on weight and make your camping, backpacking or hiking trip a lightweight trip.</strong> There are a couple of things to consider when taking a tarp camping, and a couple of different tarps that you can take as well, but tarp camping is a great way to get a little closer to the natural world when camping.
<h3>Tarp Camping - Things to Consider</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Poles</strong> - When tarp camping, something you have to consider is what you're going to use as poles. If you're hiking somewhere heavily forested you can always just use the trees at your campsite or even rig up some deadfall as poles. Another excellent option, however, is to bring <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/trekking-poles/\">trekking poles</a> along with you. They're useful for hiking and can also double as poles when tarp camping, making them a great dual use item.</li>
	<li><strong>Bugs</strong> - Another thing to consider when tarp camping is that you'll be exposed to bugs at night. Depending on where you are and the season this may or may not be a problem, but bugs can ruin an otherwise good nights sleep, so it helps to be prepared. You could, for instance, just wear a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/head-net\" rel=\"nofollow\">head net</a> inside your sleeping bag. You could also take along a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bug-bivy\" rel=\"nofollow\">lightweight bug bivy</a>, attach a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bug-bivy\" rel=\"nofollow\">pyramid bug net</a> to your camping tarp, or even use a tarp, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-1-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Shangri-La 1</a>, with its specialized <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-1-nest\" rel=\"nofollow\">bug net attachment</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tarp Camping - Different Kinds of Camping Tarps</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Poncho Tarps</strong> - The most versatile camping tarp you can take with you in to the outdoors is a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/poncho-tarp-tents/\">poncho tarp</a>. Poncho tarps can be used as a poncho for rain gear, and also as a tarp to keep your dry at night. Be careful though, because poncho tarps can only do one of those things at a time. When you probably wont need rain gear, however, they make an ideal camping tarp choice. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/poncho-tarp\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Poncho Tarp</a> is one popular poncho tarp.</li>
	<li><strong>Rectangular Tarps</strong> - The basic tarp setup is a rectangular tarp, which can be pitched in a variety of different ways. It's a versatile design and is useful as a tarp, but also as a potential ground sheet, pack cover or even emergency bivy bag. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/white-lightnin-tarp\" rel=\"nofollow\">White Lightnin' Tarp</a> from Granite Gear is a good example of this style.</li>
	<li><strong>Shaped Tarps</strong> - There are also shaped tarps that are specially designed to work as a camping tarp and provide maximum protection from the elements. They often go right down to the ground and include a door. Some, such as the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-1-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Shangri-La 1</a>, have <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-1-nest\" rel=\"nofollow\">attachments</a> that can be purchased to provide protection from mosquitoes and other creatures found in the outdoors when tarp camping. The Shangri-La also comes in a number of different sizes, including a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-2-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-3-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/shangri-la-5-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">5</a> person version.</li>

<strong>Camping soap is almost always a must for when you are going camping, because there's almost always something to clean. </strong>Even if you don't feel like cleaning yourself, and for the sake of your fellow hikers it's something I suggest you at least consider, there are dishes and possibly clothes to clean, and having a little camping soap on around comes in handy.

Here are a few backpacking soaps to consider for your next trip in to the outdoors.
<h3>Camping Soaps List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/730925/dr-bronners-organic-liquid-soap-travel-size\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Bronners Soap</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scrowed-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - Dr. Bronners soap is an all-in-one kind of camping soap good for just about anything you can think to clean. It even makes a half decent tooth paste, provided you pick an appetizing flavor. And that's one of the best things about Dr. Bronners, there are a whole wide range of flavors to choose from. Follow the link and check out all the positive reviews if you still aren't convinced, because Dr. Bronners is a great choice for a backpacking soap.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.summithut.com/products/wilderness-wash/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit Wilderness Wash</a> - The Wilderness wash from Australian company Sea to Summit is a great all-in-one camping soap. It's biodegradable and concentrated, so a little goes a long way. It also comes in a tough little bottle with a nozzle, which makes it ideal as a camping soap.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camping-soap\" rel=\"nofollow\">Campsuds Camping Soap</a> - Campsuds focuses on camping soaps, so they're a good choice when picking a backpacking soap. It's biodegradable so it can go right in to the environment, and can be used for everything from dishes to hair. You can also buy it in a few different sizes, so you could, for instance, pick up a small size to take with you in to the outdoors, and a bigger one for refills.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packsoap\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Packsoap</a> - MSR also has a camping soap on the market, and like most others it is an all-in-one backpacking soap that works for a variety of different uses. It's also hypoallergenic and free of phosphates, scents and a few other things. It comes in a small, 2 ounce bottle ideal for taking with you backpacking, hiking, or camping.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/634320/nalgene-drop-dispenser-bottle-2-fl-oz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dropper Bottle</a> - Some camping soaps come in small bottles with a nozzle that are ideal to take with you in to the outdoors. But if you want to buy a large amount and take a small portion of it with you, or if your camping soap comes in a bottle that isn't hiker friendly, than a dropper bottle is the perfect solution.</li>

Camping toothpaste is another <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/camping-hygiene/\">camping hygiene</a> product that it can be comforting to bring along. <strong>The problem, however, is finding camping toothpaste that is fairly biodegradable and in a small enough size that it doesn't weigh too much.</strong>

Here are a few camping toothpaste options to consider.
<h3>Camping Toothpastes List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/toothpaste-tablets-mint-60-pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">ArchTek Toothpaste Tablets</a> - These are a fantastic product from ArchTek for those looking for a camping toothpaste. You chew the tablets and then go at your teeth with your toothbrush. They're a smart camping toothpaste option for several reasons. You can take the exact right amount of tablets so you don't have any extra weight. You also don't need water with these, which is certainly convenient. All in all, a great camping toothpaste option.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/815167/burts-bees-trial-travel-multicare-natural-toothpaste-with-fluoride\" rel=\"nofollow\">Burt's Bees Trial and Travel Multicare Natural Toothpaste</a> - Burt's Bees make a lot of great hygiene products, and this hiker friendly camping toothpaste is an example of that. It's a good toothpaste that comes in a small bottle, so it's ideal for hiking and backpacking. It's also fairly natural and does not include a lot of the less natural stuff in toothpastes, so it's fairly biodegradable.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D3760911%26ref_%3Dbl_sr_beauty%26field-brandtextbin%3DDr.%2520Bronner%2527s%2520Magic%2520Soaps%23&amp;tag=scrowed-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Bronners Soap</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scrowed-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - Dr. Bronners is actually a soap, and not a camping toothpaste. It has a reputation, however, of being an excellent all-in-one product, and some people do use it as a soap and as a toothpaste. The obvious benefit of this is that you don't need to take a stand-alone camping toothpaste, but can instead use your camping soap as your camping toothpaste as well.</li>

<h2>Lightweight Shelters</h2>
<strong>All it takes is one trip lugging around a 5 pound shelter to convince most people that there has got to be a better way. And there is, it's called a lightweight shelter.</strong> If you take the time to do a little research you can find shelters with innovative designs, lightweight fabrics and minimalist features that weigh only a fraction of a shelter with the same capacity. So why take the heavy shelter when you could take the lightweight shelter instead?
<h2>Common Features of Lightweight Shelters</h2>
A shelter is a simple enough piece of gear, but there is a surprising amount of variety within the shelter market. Which is good, because that means there's also a big difference in weights. Here are a few features common to most lightweight shelters.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight Fabrics</strong> - The choice of fabric will often be one of the biggest factors in the overall weight of the tent, just because that's mostly what a tent is, it's all fabric. UK manufacturer Terra Nova, for example, developed their very own lightweight fabric, which they call ULTRA, and use it on their <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-ultra-1-p-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laser Ultra 1</a>, which is currently the lightest 2-wall tent on the market, according to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>. Another excellent fabric is silnylon, of which the <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-photon-1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laser Photon 1</a>, also from UK manufacturer Terra Nova, is an excellent example. The Laser Photon 1 weighs only 670 grams, or 1.47 pounds, and is a good example of using advanced fabrics to save weight.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall Shelters</strong> - Another obvious way to create a lightweight shelter is to leave half of the material out of the design process, and create a shelter that has only a single wall, rather than the traditional inner tent with a fly. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fast-stash\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Fast Stash</a> is a great example of an innovative, single-wall design, lightweight shelter, as is the<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hilight-tent-1-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Black Diamond Hilight</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Trekking Pole Supports</strong> - Why take poles when you can use your <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/trekking-poles/\">trekking poles</a> instead? A few carbon fiber poles may not weigh much, but no carbon fiber poles weighs even less, and some tents give you the option of using your trekking poles as tent poles. The <a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarptent Contrail</a> is a great example of just this kind of lightweight shelter.</li>
	<li><strong>Small Lightweight Shelters</strong> - Another feature often employed by shelter manufacturers to make their shelters lighter is to make the shelter itself as small as possible. This may not leave you with a lot of head room, but it will help relieve your sore back, since you wont have to carry as much weight. <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 1</a> is a great example of such a tent. It's a very popular shelter, as all the positive reviews attest to, but is not the roomiest shelter either. It also comes in a few different sizes, including <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">2</a>, <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-3-tent-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">3</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-4-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">4</a> person capacities.</li>

<strong>Winter camping can be a lot of fun, provided you keep a few things in mind before heading out in to the wilderness in the colder months of the year.</strong> Cold temperatures pose all sorts of safety concerns that warm weather doesn't. Winter camping, however, offers a unique view of the wilderness that shouldn't be passed on.
<h3>Winter Camping - Gear</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A warm sleeping bag is one of the most important considerations when heading out to do some winter camping. The last thing you want to do is shiver all night, so especially in the winter, it's always better to error on the side of caution. Mont Bell makes a wide range of well made and well reviewed <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camp-hike/sleeping-bags?brand=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">sleeping bags</a> suitable for winter conditions, but if you really want to find the right sleeping bag for you, check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">sleeping bags list</a> to compare features on a wide selection of sleeping bags.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Another crucial piece of winter camping gear is your sleeping pad. Though many people don't realize it, you lose a lot of heat in to whatever is below you. That's why sleeping pad manufacturers often advertise an <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">R-value</a>, which is a measurement of the insulating capabilities of a sleeping pad. <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camp-hike/pads/sleeping-pads?brand=58\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped</a> is one sleeping pad manufacturer that makes a lot of well reviewed sleeping pads with high R-values, but you can also head over to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">sleeping pads list</a> to compare most of the sleeping pads on the market by their R-value and more.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - The last you want when winter camping is to find yourself in a storm you are unprepared to weather. Having had a tent collapse on me before, I can tell you that it pays to have a tent that you know can handle high winds and lots of moisture. The best way to find a good tent for winter camping is to look for four season tents. You can find most of the four season tents on the market, and compare them by features like weight, over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Camping - Clothing</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Jacket</a> (and the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's version</a>) - When you head out to do any winter camping, staying warm should be one of your chief concerns, and the best way to do that is with a down jacket. Down will keep you warm, shield you from the wind and best of all, it weighs next to nothing. It also layers well with other pieces of gear. Unlike a heavy fleece, a down inner jacket is an ideal addition to a winter camping gear bag. Mont Bell's products are also rated very well, and are dependable.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Pants</a> (and the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's version</a>) - You should keep the lower half of your body as warm as your upper half, and down garments work equally well there too. Mont Bell makes a line of inner down pants to go along with the inner down jackets. They feature the same excellent construction and reviews that the Mont Bell down jackets get, so if you're looking to keep your legs warm while winter camping, consider these inner pants from Mont Bell.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Camping - Why You Should do it</h3>
There are a couple of really great reasons why you should go winter camping. One big advantage to camping in the winter is that there are going to be a lot less people out on the trail. It's never much fun, after all, to head out to the wilderness, only to find that everyone else has had the same thought too.

Another great reason to enjoy a bit of winter camping is that the natural world changes in the winter, and you're likely to see all kinds of sights that you wouldn't see in the summer. Different wildlife, for instance, and if you're lucky enough to go camping somewhere with ample amounts of snow, you might see some really spectacular vistas.
<h3>Winter Camping - Safety Concerns</h3>
Of course there are always safety concerns when camping, and especially when winter camping. In addition to the usual concerns, you also have to plan for cold weather, storms, and maybe even snow, depending on where you are. A big part of being prepared is taking along the proper gear with you when going winter camping.

When venturing out in to the wilderness, regardless of the season, a big part of being safe is being prepared."

<strong>Winter backpacking is vastly different from summer backpacking, and you should be aware of the requirements that winter backpacking places on you before you go venturing out in to the cold weather for a backpacking adventure.</strong>

First and foremost, when winter backpacking you need to be aware of the possible dangers and safety concerns that winter backpacking entails. Spending multiple days in the outdoors during the winter means that you may have to contend with changing weather, which can come on quite suddenly in the winter in many parts of the world. You should be prepared for snow, wind, rain and dipping temperatures before you leave the house.

Winter backpacking isn't all safety concerns, however. There are a lot of interesting things to be seen during the winter in the outdoors, and winter backpacking, spending multiple days in the outdoors, is a great way to experience those various things. As long as you go out prepared, you shouldn't have any problems, and should be able to enjoy yourself.
<h3>Winter Backpacking Gear</h3>
Going winter backpacking is all about being prepared, and that comes down to gear. Here are a few suggestions for your winter backpacking gear list.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - A summer tent might do, but a winter tent will provide peace of mind when winter backpacking. As someone who has personally weathered a wind storm in a flattened tent, I can tell you that it's better to be over prepared than under prepared.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is another important piece of winter backpacking gear. You need to be prepared for temperature dips, and a summer sleeping bag wont cut it. If you plan on going winter backpacking you should have a standalone winter sleeping bag to use.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Sleeping pads have what are called an <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">R-value</a> rating, which is a rating of how well the sleeping pad insulates you. A sleeping pad with a high R-value, then, will keep you warm and toasty at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-backpacking-boots/\">Winter Backpacking Boots</a> - When venturing out in to the winter landscape, shoes wont cut it. You will something with a little more substance that will keep your feet dry, no matter what conditions you encounter.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - Even if the weather seems good when you leave to go winter backpacking, things can change quickly in the colder months, and it might be beneficial to bring along a few extra insulating layers. Mont Bell makes some excellent down <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">top</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">bottom</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>) garments that pack up small and weigh next to nothing, but will keep you warm when you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - If there is the possibility that some of the trails you will be travelling along have snow, or will have snow while you are out backpacking, then it might pay off to bring along hiking snowshoes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Winter Backpacking Experience</h3>
Winter backpacking is a lot different than summer backpacking, and everyone should definitely experience it at least once. You see wildly different things, like fields of snow and frozen lakes, that you aren't able to see any other time of the year.

One of the best things about winter backpacking, however, is that you often have the trail all to yourself. Most people don't bother to step outside much in the winter, and winter backpacking can be drastically different from the overcrowded summer trails that many of us are used to."

<strong>Spending time in the outdoors during the winter months can be enjoyable, but you should be prepared, and being prepared means having the right winter backpacking gear with you.</strong>

Backpacking typically means spending the night in the wilderness, and so you will need the proper winter backpacking gear to get through the night without shivering yourself awake.

Beyond camping gear, there are a few other winter backpacking items that should be on your winter backpacking gear list. There are also a few winter backpacking items that you could bring along to make your winter backpacking adventure more enjoyable.
<h3>Winter Backpacking Gear List Ideas</h3>
This is by no means a complete winter backpacking gear list, but it will at least get you the essentials.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is an essential item for any winter backpacking gear list. You will need to stay warm at night, and a winter sleeping bag is essential for that. You can supplement your summer sleeping bag with a liner if the weather you're heading in to is relatively warm, but for most winter backpacking trips, you will need a stand alone winter sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - You should have a winter sleeping pad to go along with your winter sleeping bag. A winter sleeping pad will contain insulation that will trap and reflect the heat that you lose in to the ground from your body.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - To complete your sleep system for winter backpacking you should have a winter tent. If you wont be encountering any bad weather then a summer tent will probably hold up, but winter weather can be ugly, and a winter tent will be an essential piece of winter backpacking gear in most situations.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-backpacking-boots/\">Winter Backpacking Boots</a> - You tend to do a lot of walking when you are backpacking, and for all that walking you should have a proper pair of winter backpacking boots. If you plan to spend multiple days out on a winter backpacking trip, your feet will be one of the most vulnerable body areas, and you will need something waterproof and warm to protect against that.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - If you plan to go winter backpacking where there is a fair amount of snow, and the possibility of fresh snow, then hiking snowshoes might be a good idea. Just be sure to get a pair with a proper load capacity that takes in to account the weight of your backpack, or they wont be much use to you.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - You cant predict the future, and though the weather may be great when you set out backpacking, winter weather can change quickly. Another essential piece of winter backpacking gear, then, is a few insulating layers to add to the warmth of your other layers. Mont Bell, a Japanese manufacturer, makes a few down products that weigh almost nothing, pack small and provide large amounts of warmth. You can find a<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\"> jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>) and a matching pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>).</li>

<h2>Tarp Camping in Winter</h2>
<a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-tents/\">Tarp tents</a> are almost always a great idea. They cut down on a huge amount of weight and let you get closer to nature, which is never a bad thing. But how practical are they for winter? Well that depends. Before you take your <strong>tarp camping in winter</strong> ask yourself a few things....
<ul>
	<li>What does the weather report say?</li>
	<li>What kind of wind and snow conditions can I expect?</li>
	<li>What kind of tarp do I have?</li>

Camping in a dense forest with a light snowfall is a perfectly safe place to have a tarp. Camping on an exposed ridge during a storm is a good way to say goodbye to your tarp and maybe a few fingers from frostbite as well. Camping with a tarp in winter is weather dependent. It's a situation where you have to have a good idea of where you're going and what to expect in terms of weather. It helps to have experience with winter camping and with tarp camping in less than favorable conditions. Experience like that really does go a long way to providing you with some safety.

There's also the question of what kind of tarp you're taking with you for winter camping. Many tarps are nothing more than a rectangular piece of fabric that you use trekking poles or trees to help form in to the shape of a shelter. Other tarps though are made with a specific set up in mind and are really more like tents without a floor. As you can guess the rectangular piece of fabric might not be well suited to camping in winter, while the tarp tent that is a tent without a floor would be ideally suited to winter weather conditions.
<h2>Ideal Tarps for Winter Camping</h2>
Here are a few tarp tents that are a bit more robust and that would be well suited to camping in winter.

<h2>Best Trekking Poles</h2>
The best trekking poles share a few common qualities that are easy to look for when shopping around for your next pair of trekking poles.
<h3>Best Trekking Poles - Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - First and foremost, the best trekking poles will be light trekking poles. Trekking poles may help save your knees, but that wont matter all that much if they weigh too much and end up ruining your shoulders. You need your shoulders just as much as you need your knees.</li>
	<li><strong>Adjustable</strong> - Most of the best trekking poles are also length adjustable, though Gossamer Gear is a notable exception. If you are looking for the absolute lightest trekking poles, then you need to sacrifice adjustability.</li>
	<li><strong>Material</strong> - Most of the best trekking poles are also carbon trekking poles. Aluminum does have its place, but the best trekking poles tend to be carbon as it is a lighter material.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Trekking Poles List</h3>
Here are a few of the best trekking poles currently on the market to consider.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/trekking/lt3c-trekking-poles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear LT3C</a> - The lightest trekking poles on the market. If weight is your chief concern then these are the best trekking poles for you. They're carbon which helps to shed ounces but where they really lose weight is in the lack of a length adjusting system. You order one length and you get what you get. There's lots of sizes to choose from and as long as you order right you'll be happy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813391/black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Poles</a> - Winner of the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award for Best Trekking Poles in 2011</strong>, the Ultra Distance Z-Poles are an excellent choice for someone looking for a lightweight, adjustable set of carbon fiber trekking poles.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.summithut.com/products/alpine-lite-poles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped Alpine Lite</a> - Though Exped isn't all that well known for their trekking poles they do make them and they are light. In fact the Alpine Lites are some of the lightest aluminum trekking poles on the market. If you prefer aluminum over carbon fiber then these are probably the best trekking poles for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://makais.com/products/Komperdell-C3-DuoLock-Trekking-Poles.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Komperdell C3 DuoLock</a> - The C3 Duolocks are some of Komperdell's lightest trekking poles.

<h2>Popular Backpacks</h2>
It's hard to judge which are the most beloved backpacks, but I've based popular on two things mainly, which are reputation and reviews. I've also separated the backpacks in to a few different categories to help you find which are the most popular backpacks with certain basic features.
<h2>Popular High Capacity Backpacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/catalyst.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Catalyst</a> - ULA make many excellent lightweight backpacks that are popular with lightweight backpacking enthusiasts. Their whole product line is excellent, and while the 75 Liter Catalyst is a smaller capacity than many high capacity backpacks, some of which get upwards of 100 Liters, it makes up for it by being an extremely lightweight backpack. If weight is a big concern then this backpack may be the one for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/arcteryx-bora-95-backpack-5250-6040cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arc'teryx Bora 95</a> - The Bora 95 is yet another high quality backpack. The Bora is nowhere near as light as the Catalyst, but it's got 25 more Liters of carrying capacity and is well reviewed and popular with the backpacking community.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/osprey-packs-argon-70-backpack-4300-4700cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osprey Argon 70</a> - The 70 is the smallest of the Argon line of bags from Osprey, there's also an 85 and a 110 if you're looking for something bigger. The Argon is another of the top backpacks that wont stack up to the Catalyst in terms of weight but is very well reviewed and evidently very popular with backpackers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popular Frame Backpacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/circuit.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment Circuit</a> - The Circuit is a step down from the Catalyst above. It's got a smaller, more lightweight frame and less carrying capacity, and that works out to an appreciable weight difference between the two. If weight is your chief concern in looking for a backpack then ULA is the brand for you. They make popular backpacks and the Circuit is one of their most popular.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/granite-gear-blaze-ac-60\" rel=\"nofollow\">Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60</a> - The Blaze A.C. 60 won top honors at the Backpacker Magazine Awards for Editor's Choice of Best Backpack. It's new for 2011 so it hasn't had a chance to gain many reviews or followers yet, but Backpacker Magazine has a good track history with picking quality gear and you can be sure this is going to be a well loved backpack from a well respected backpacking manufacturer.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780216/osprey-atmos-50-pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osprey Atmos 50</a> - The Atmos is another award winner, this time for Outside Magazine. The design has been upgraded since it won top honors but they haven't changed any of the things that made it such a good backpack to begin with. It's not as lightweight as the Circuit but with all the positive reviews for this backpack it's hard to find much of a fault.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popular Frameless Backpacks</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - It's not a coincidence that ULA has a backpack in all three of these categories. Lightweight backpackers know and respect their products, and if you're looking for lightweight ULA is a safe place to turn. The CDT is low on capacity and weight, making it an ideal choice for those looking for a lightweight backpack to really embrace the idea of lightweight backpacking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/g4-ultralight-backpack-63.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear G4 Ultralight</a> - The G4 is another lightweight backpack that is no doubt well known to lightweight backpacking enthusiasts but not so much to everyone else. The G4 has been through a few design evolutions over the years and has only gotten better with age. The evolution in design has helped it to become a more respected backpack over the years and if you're looking for a lightweight frameless backpack it's worth considering.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/jam-pack-3050-cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Jam</a> - The Jam is another backpack that's been through a few design tweaks since it first came on to the market. Those design tweaks have added a few ounces to the overall weight of the backpack, but the additions have only served to improve the design and make it a more beloved backpack.</li>

<strong>The best camping knife is a knife lightweight enough that it wont add a lot of extra weight to your bag, but with enough size and strength to provide all the functionality of a larger knife. </strong><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-multi-tool-for-backpacking/\">Multi-Tools for Backpacking</a> are something else to consider, but knives usually weigh far less and can provide most of the same functionality.

There are two options when considering the best camping knife, folding knives and fixed blade knives. Folding knives don't need a sheath and are small enough to fit in to a pocket. Fixed blade knives, however, are stronger but typically a bit heavier. They do not, however, fit well in to a pocket, but usually come with a sheath that will fit easily on to a belt.
<h3>Best Camping Knife List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/gerber-e-z-out-skeleton-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerber EZ Out</a> - The Gerber EZ Out is a small folding knife that weighs only 85 grams, or 3 ounces. It has a belt clip and is small enough to fit comfortably in a pocket. Being a fold out knife it doesn't have much lateral strength, but it's well reviewed, and if you're looking for a small knife that can fit in a pocket, this may be the best camping knife for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/peck-in-the-dark\" rel=\"nofollow\">Columbia River Peck in the Dark</a> - The Peck in the Dark from Columbia River is another folding knife popular with campers, backpackers and hikers. The stand out feature of the Peck in the Dark is the weight, which is only 25 grams, or .9 ounces. It's small too, and can fit in a pocket or anywhere else that is convenient. So if lightweight is what you're looking for then the Peck in the Dark my be the best backpacking knife for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/m16-13-zytel-combo-edge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Columbia River M16-13 Zytel Combo Edge</a> - The Zytel is another folding knife from Columbia River. It's a bit larger than most folding knives, with a 3.56 inch blade. It's a bit heavier too, at 105 grams, or 3.7 ounces. More weight means more strength, however, so if the best hiking knife for you is a folding knife with a bit of heft and strength then the Zytel is an ideal choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-grylls-ultimate-survival-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Grylls Ultimate Survival Knife</a> - This knife, manufactured by Gerber, is a fixed blade knife with a number of survival features built in, such as a steel pommel for hammering, a whistle, a sharpener in the sheath and a fire starter too. The weight is 317 grams, or 11.2 ounces, so it's not the lightest knife, but if you're looking for a survival knife with all the bells and whistles this is the best camping knife for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/752020/gerber-big-rock-serrated-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gerber Big Rock Fixed Blade</a> - This is a great, no-frills fixed blade utility knife from Gerber. It has a serrated edge and a steel pommel for whacking things. The blade length is 4.5 inches and the weight is 178 grams, or 6.3 ounces. It's hefty and strong, so if you're not so concerned about weight and want something that's going to be used a lot, the Big Rock Fixed Blade is the best camping knife.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/temagami-survivorman-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helle Temagami (Survivorman) Knife</a> - In terms of quality of construction this is the best camping knife on the list. It's a fixed blade knife from the other big name in survivor television, Les Stroud of Survivorman. It comes with a well oiled wooden handle and has a classic look, and not any of the survival features of the Bear Grylls knife. Each one is hand made though, and the quality is unmistakable. It weighs 400 grams, or 14.1 ounces, so not the lightest knife, but if you want something classic and well made, this is a fantastic choice.</li>

<h2>Sleeping Pad R-Values</h2>
<strong>Sleeping Pad R-Values are an important measure of the insulation capabilities of a sleeping pad.</strong> The term R-value comes from the construction industry and was adopted by the hiking and backpacking industry. Determining an R-value is a complex process, and is usually done by the manufacturer.

To compare sleeping pad R-values, check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">sleeping pad list</a>.
<h3>High Sleeping Pad R-Values</h3>
A high sleeping pad R-value indicates that the sleeping pad has a large amount of insulation, and will give the underside of your body ample insulation. Though it may not be obvious, you actually lose large amounts of heat from the underside of your body while sleeping, so a high sleeping pad R-value is important when hiking and backpacking in the winter. Sleeping pads with high R-values are also ideal to use with <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-quilts/\">backpacking quilts</a>, which will keep your topside warm and allow your underside to be kept warm by the sleeping pad.

Here are a few sleeping pads with high R-values that would be ideal for hiking and backpacking in colder temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/dreamtime-mattresses\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest Dreamtime Mattress</a> - The Therm-A-Rest Dreamtime mattress has one of the highest sleeping pad R-values, at 9, that you will find on the market. All that insulation is heavy, however, and the Dreamtime weighs 3 kg, or 6.6 pounds, so it's not light. If you need a sleeping pad with a high R-value, however, you cant do better than this.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/two-track-pad-2-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Two Track Pad</a> - The Big Agnes Two Track has a lower sleeping pad R-value of only 6.5, which is still warm but not toasty. But it weighs only 1020 kilograms, or 2.25 pounds, and comes in a mummy shape, and also gets some great reviews, so it's another warm sleeping pad with a high R-value worth considering.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped Downmat 9 Pad</a> - The Exped Downmat has a very respectable sleeping pad R-value of 8, making it a very warm sleeping pad. Where it really shines, however, is in the weight department. It weighs only 1020 kilograms, or 2.25 pounds, which is less than many sleeping pads with a much lower R-value, so if you want something warm and light, definitely consider the Exped Downmat.</li>
</ul>
Find more high R-value sleeping pads over at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">Sleeping Pads List</a>.
<h3>Low Sleeping Pad R-Values</h3>
A low sleeping pad R-value means that the sleeping pad has little or no insulation, and will not provide very much warmth as a result. Insulation tends to weigh a lot, however, and so cutting back on insulation means your backpack will end up weighing less. Sleeping pads with low R-values are ideal for summer conditions where warmth isn't as much of a concern.

Here are a few sleeping pads with low R-values to consider.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/sleeping/1-8.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear Thinlight Insulation Pad</a> - The Gossamer Gear Thinlight is made from foam, and is not inflatable, like most sleeping pads. There are several benefits to foam, one of which is a low sleeping pad R-value. The thinlight R-value, for example, is just .45, which is very little insulation. For summer hiking and backpacking, however, you wont need much insulation. Another benefit of foam is weight. The Thinlight weighs just 69 grams, or 2.4 ounces, which is so light you'll hardly even realize you're carrying it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/clearview-air-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Clearview Air Pad</a> - The Big Agnes Clearview has an sleeping pad R-value of just 1, which is very little insulation, making it ideal for the summer months. It's inflatable, and weighs only 396 grams, or 14 ounces, which makes it an ideal trade-off between weight and insulation.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir Sleeping Pad</a> - The Therm-A-Rest NeoAir is an extremely popular sleeping pad, and with good reason. It has a sleeping pad R-value of 2.5, making it ideal for a variety of warmer temperatures, but weighs only 410 grams, or 14.5 ounces, which is an impressive weight saving over other sleeping pads with lower R-values. If you're looking for an inflatable warm weather sleeping pad that can do it all, the NeoAir is the obvious choice.</li>

<strong>Having a good winter sleeping bag that has a proper temperature rating for the kinds of weather that you will be going in to is crucial for any <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-camping/\">winter camping</a> that you do, for several reasons.</strong>

One is safety. Winter weather can be unpredictable, and exposure to cold temperatures, especially for long periods of time, can lead to hypothermia and worse.

Another reason to have a good winter sleeping bag when going out in to the wilderness in cold temperatures is your own comfort. Shivering all night is no fun, and you will want to be toasty warm after a long day.
<h3>Winter Sleeping Bag Features</h3>
There are a few things that will make for a good winter sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Goose Down</strong> - It's true that synthetic insulation does better than down when it gets wet, but this does not mean that you should abandon down all together when looking at winter sleeping bags. There are sleeping bags that have waterproof outer layers (the Western Mountaineering Bison Gore below, for instance) and keeping a sleeping bag dry is not too much work, provided you know what you are doing.</li>
	<li><strong>Temperature Rating</strong> - This should go without saying, but when looking for winter sleeping bags, you should first get an idea of what kind of temperatures you will be going in to. Then, when you know what temperature rating to look for, find a winter sleeping bag that matches. The misery that is shivering all night long in your sleeping bag cannot be reinforced enough.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Sleeping Bags</h3>
Here are a few cold weather sleeping bags to consider. Consider also taking a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">sleeping bags list</a> to compare sleeping bags by features like temperature rating, weight and more. Also, head over to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">winter sleeping pads</a> page to find a good winter sleeping pad to go along with your winter sleeping bag.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-bison-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-40-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western Mountaineering Bison Gore</a> - If you're looking for a winter sleeping bag that will keep you warm on even the coldest nights, then this -40 sleeping bag is a good choice. It features top of the line 850 fill down, along with a wind stopper shell to keep you toasty no matter what the weather decides to do. It's not light, and it's not terribly cheap either, but it gets good reviews, and Western Mountaineering is an excellent sleeping bag manufacturer that offers a lifetime warranty, so this will be the last winter sleeping bag you ever have to buy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Super Spiral Down EXP</a> - This is a -20 winter sleeping bag from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell, who are well known for making excellent down products. This winter sleeping bag comes with 800 fill down and a unique and innovative diagonal construction technique that adds warmth and longevity without adding weight. This is a cold weather sleeping bag definitely worth considering in the -20 range.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/795986/mountain-hardwear-phantom-0-sleeping-bag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain Hardwear Phantom</a> - This is one of the lightest winter sleeping bags on the market at the 0 temperature rating. It comes with 800 fill down so you get a good weight to insulation ratio, as well as a snug fit to save on weight. If you're looking for a lightweight winter sleeping bag, consider the Phantom.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/warm-up-sheets\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell Warm Up Sheet</a> - If you're heading in to cold weather that is only a few degrees outside of your cold weather sleeping bag's temperature rating then you should consider a sleeping bag liner. There are a number to choose from, but Mont Bell makes a good one that gets great reviews and is lightweight too. It also doubles as a summer sleeping bag for really warm nights.</li>

<strong>When taking a trip through the wilderness in winter, it is important that you plan for any and all conditions, because winter weather can be unpredictable, and a big part of that is having a good winter tent with you. </strong>You should have something that is capable of withstanding wind, rain, snow and anything else that a sudden winter storm might bring on.

As someone who has had to sleep in a bent and broken tent through a winter storm, I can tell you that having a good four season tent that you can rely on is crucial for both enjoying yourself in the outdoors and also staying safe.
<h3>Winter Tent Features</h3>
There are a few features that you should look for on your next winter tent purchase.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Low Profile</strong> - Wind is always going to be a problem in winter conditions, and you will want an all-season tent that has a low profile. Of course there are exceptions to this (see the MSR Dragontail below) get generally, you want something low to the ground with heavily sloped sides.</li>
	<li><strong>Robust Pole Structure</strong> - In the summer you can easily get by with just one pole on a lightweight tent, but in winter you want sufficient poles that your tent wont turn in to a pancake at the first gust. And related to this, poles that snap on, rather than thread through, are often easier to set up when the wind is really blowing.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof</strong> - This almost goes without saying, but a tent intended for winter user should be waterproof. This does not mean, however, that you should ignore all single wall tents. A waterproof single wall tent, properly ventilated, can offer everything that two walls can, at half the weight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Tent Reviews</h3>
Here are a few cold weather tents to consider for your next outdoor adventure in cold temperatures. Check out even more tents at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>.

A lot of people discount the importance of a sleeping pad when thinking about staying warm in cold temperatures, but there is a definite difference between regular sleeping pads and winter sleeping pads, and <strong>you will be far more comfortable in winter conditions if you bring a winter sleeping pad with you.</strong>

The chief distinguishing feature of a winter sleeping pad is the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">sleeping pad R-value</a>. R-value is actually a construction term that refers to the insulating properties of, in this case, a sleeping pad. The higher the R-value, the less heat you will lose in to the ground at night.

The best winter sleeping pads are actually padded with insulating material, such as down, to help trap and reflect the heat that your body gives off. This supplements the insulating capabilities of your <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">winter sleeping bag</a> and keeps you warm in toasty at night.

<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/basecamp-sleep-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest BaseCamp</a> - If you're not terribly worried about weight, then the BaseCamp from Therm-A-Rest makes a good choice for taking with you in to winter conditions. It weighs in at 2 lbs, 9 ounces, or 1150 grams, and has an R-value of 5, which is right in the middle of the spectrum. If you're looking for a basic winter sleeping pad to keep you warm, the BaseCamp is a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped Downmat 9</a> - The Downmat from Exped is one of the best winter sleeping pads on the market. It's one of the best because at weight of 36 ounces, or 1020 grams, it manages an R-value 8, which is one of the highest on the market.

<strong>Winter backpacking is completely different from backpacking in the warmer months, and it helps to know what to bring with you, which is why a winter backpacking checklist can be a helpful resource to consult.</strong>

When you go winter backpacking, you will need a few things that would not normally come along in a summer backpack. You may also need to upgrade or swap out different versions of things for warmer versions. A summer sleeping bag, for instance, can be supplemented with a sleeping bag liner, but the best option is to have a separate, <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">winter sleeping bag</a> to take along with you in to the outdoors. Similarly, it helps to bring along a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">winter sleeping pad</a> for added warmth so that you don't find yourself shivering at night.

By preparing in advance for a winter backpacking adventure you will stay both comfortable in the outdoors and safe, should the weather take a turn for the worse.
<h3>Winter Backpacking Checklist</h3>
Here are a few things to consider taking with you when going winter backpacking. It's by no means complete, but it should give you a good jumping off point to help fill out your backpack with everything that you'll need for cold temperatures.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - You can always take your summer bag and a hefty bag liner, but the safer and lighter option is a winter sleeping bag with a temperature rating suitable for the weather you are expecting.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - Many three season tents will handle snow and wind without much of a problem, but if you are expecting ugly conditions, or if you are looking for a little peace of mind, then a winter tent is something to consider.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Though you might not know it, you lose a lot of your heat in to the ground when you sleep, and a winter sleeping pad will have extra insulation to help protect against that.</li>
	<li><strong>Warm Clothing</strong> - Warm clothing is a must when winter backpacking. Mont Bell makes a great <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\">down inner jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>), and matching <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down pants liners</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>). You should also be taking along <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mens-clothing/mens-accessories/mens-gloves\" rel=\"nofollow\">gloves</a> and a warm <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mens-clothing/mens-accessories/mens-hats\" rel=\"nofollow\">hat</a>, at a minimum, to keep your extremities toasty warm.</li>
	<li><strong>Waterproof Outer Layers</strong> - Having waterproof outer layers to compliment your warm inner insulating layers is important. Rab makes a great <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/latok-alpine-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">alpine men's jacket</a> (and a similar <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lyra-jacket-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's jacket</a>), while Rab also makes a matching pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/alpine-tour-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">pants</a> (similar <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tamarack-pant-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's pants</a>).</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-shoes/\">Backpacking shoes</a> are great for the warmer months, but in the winter you want a boot that is going to protect your feet from snow, rain and safety concerns that exposing your feet to cold, damp conditions brings on. Also consider a good pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/footwear/mens-shoes/mens-socks\" rel=\"nofollow\">socks</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mens-clothing/mens-accessories/men-gaiters\" rel=\"nofollow\">gaiters</a> to keep the snow out of your boots.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/mens-clothing/mens-accessories/mens-sunglasses\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunglasses</a> - As counter-intuitive as it might seem, sunglasses are a must when heading in to snowy conditions. A bright sunny day trekking across open snow can lead to snow blindness, which is a serious safety concern, especially if you are alone. Sunglasses weigh next to nothing, so bring them along if you're heading in to snow. And for the same reason, consider bringing <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/store/search.html?mv_session_id=wTVhoPso&amp;q=sunscreen\" rel=\"nofollow\">sunscreen</a> along.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Snowshoes</a> - If your plan is to go to the snow, then snowshoes will be a good idea. They will help you save energy and will also help prevent snow from ending up in your boots. It also adds a bit of novelty to all the walking, which can be a nice relief.</li>
</ul>
Beyond these items, the gear you take with you should be fairly similar to the gear you take with you on summer backpacking trips."

There are many camping items, like the stove or the water filter, that don't change much from season to season, but there some other items that you definitely need for winter camping, and to make sure to don't forget any of them it's a good idea to consult a winter camping checklist.

<strong>The chief difference with seasonal camping is the weather, and the gear that you will need for the colder temperatures when camping in the winter months. </strong>As long as you make a plan and grab everything on your winter camping checklist before leaving the house, however, you shouldn't have any problems with winter camping, and you should be able to enjoy yourself in the cold outdoors.
<h3>Winter Camping Checklist Ideas</h3>
This is by no means a complete winter camping checklist, but these are at leas the essential items you will need to spend the night in the cold outdoors.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - Whether or not you need a winter tent on your winter camping checklist will depend a lot on the kind of weather you are expecting. If you're heading somewhere where there's a chance of wind, snow and other ugly winter weather, it is a good idea to bring along a four season tent. The extra reinforcement and better waterproofing that four season tents typically have will be important for fending off winter weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is a must for any winter camping checklist. Not getting a good sleep can make an otherwise enjoyable winter camping trip a frustrating experience, and there is no quicker way to get frustrated than to spend the whole night shivering. Leave your summer sleeping bag at home and pick up a sleeping bag meant for winter conditions. You will be glad you did.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Campers tend to lose a lot of their body heat in to the ground when they sleep, which is why it is a good idea to include a winter sleeping pad on your winter camping checklist. The extra insulation that a winter sleeping pad provides will help keep you warm on cold nights.</li>
	<li><strong>Footwear</strong> - If you plan to spend your time winter camping around camp and the campfire then footwear isn't such a big concern. If you plan to do a little hiking and exploring, however, <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">winter hiking boots</a> are a good idea. <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking snowshoes</a> might also be a good idea if you're heading somewhere with plenty of snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - You will be able to stay plenty warm around the campfire, but for those times when you are out and about it pays to have a few extra insulating layers available. Down garments are always a good choice, and Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell is known for making excellent down garments. Their <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>) and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>) are great for keeping your whole body warm in winter weather conditions, and should be a must on your winter camping checklist.</li>

<strong>Winter hiking can be fun and safe, but you need to respect the environment you are going in to, and be prepared, and that means consulting a winter hiking checklist before you head out. </strong>Winter weather can turn ugly very quickly, and wind storms and blizzards can come on suddenly and with little warning in many parts of the world. Being prepared for such situations means bringing the proper gear with you on a winter hike.

Winter hiking isn't all doom and gloom, however. Hiking trails are often far less populated during the winter months, and you may have the trail entirely to yourself.

<strong>You will also have a chance to see a lot of things, like frozen lakes, fields of snow and winter wildlife, that you might not otherwise see in the summer months.</strong> As long as you consult a winter hiking checklist before you step out, you can be sure that you have everything you need, and can enjoy the winter outdoors.
<h3>Winter Hiking Checklist Ideas</h3>
It's not a complete winter hiking list, but these are the winter essentials that you should be bringing with you before you head out the door for a day of hiking.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - First and foremost on your winter hiking checklist should be a sturdy, waterproof pair of winter hiking boots. When you go out for a day of hiking the body part that you will have to worry most about are your feet, because with winter hiking there is always the possibility of your feet getting both wet and cold, which is always a bad combination. So do yourself a favor and make sure that you have a good, solid pair of winter hiking boots before you head out.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - Also in the footwear department, you might want to consider a pair of hiking snowshoes for your next winter hiking trip. Snowshoes make it a lot easier to navigate over large amounts of snow, and introduce a bit of novelty in to what can sometimes a monotonous experience.</li>
	<li><strong>Sun Protection</strong> - If you are lucky enough to get a nice sunny day for your winter hike, then there are a few additional items that you should make it on to your winter hiking checklist. <strong>Sunglasses</strong>, for one, will be a good addition as they will help protect against the possibility of sun blindness. Similarly, you should take along some <strong>sunscreen</strong> as the sun reflecting off snow can give you a burn quite quickly.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> - You should also have a few insulating layers on your winter hiking checklist. You may not need them while you are moving, but if you reach a viewpoint, or decide to take a lunch break, you will want a few extra insulation layers along so that you don't get chilled when you stop moving. What is ideal is something light that packs small, so it's not weighing you down while hiking. Down is the perfect solution, and Mont Bell makes a couple of excellent down parkas in <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-parka-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-parka-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> styles, as well as matching pants, also in <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> styles.

<strong>The first winter camping tip is to plan ahead for all sorts of weather. </strong>Winter weather is unpredictable, and can change drastically, depending upon where in the world you are. Unlike summer camping, then, which is fairly forgiving, you need to plan for all sorts of weather contingencies when you go winter camping.

You should also try and pick your time of year. Maybe consult some weather data for your area and decide on a time of year that doesn't get too much ugly weather. Part of the appeal winter camping is the different weather conditions, however, so if you're looking to see some snow then definitely find out where the snow is and head there.
<h3>Winter Camping Tips - Gear</h3>
When winter camping there are a few pieces of gear that you should really bring along with you to keep you warm and safe, regardless of what the weather decides to do.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is crucial if you plan to spend the night in the outdoors during winter months. Some people may try to cut corners and use a summer sleeping bag, but shivering the entire night is no fun, and one good winter camping tip is to bring along a proper winter sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Another good winter camping tip is to bring a winter sleeping pad to compliment your winter sleeping bag. We lose a lot of body heat in to the ground when we sleep, and to help trap and reflect some of that body heat, a winter sleeping pad will be a big help.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - Another winter camping tip is to bring a proper winter tent. If you're heading somewhere fairly sheltered then a summer tent will be fine, but winter weather can destroy a summer tent rather quickly, so if you expect wind and snow you should have a winter tent to bring.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Camping Tips - The Sights</h3>
Another winter camping tip is to head somewhere that you will be able to experience all the great things about winter camping. There are things that you see during winter, such as frozen lakes and fresh snow on the ground that you just cant get any other time of the year.

<strong>Related to that, it can be tempting to stick by the campfire, but don't be afraid to go out exploring the winter wilderness when camping.</strong> Bringing along a pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">hiking snowshoes</a>, for instance, will give you access to a whole winter wonderland."

Winter backpacking and summer backpacking are apples and oranges, and you really will want to consult a few winter backpacking tips if all you are  familiar with is summer backpacking.

Staying safe while winter backpacking is only half of the story, however. You should also do your best to enjoy yourself in the outdoors when winter backpacking, because there are plenty of things to see and do that just aren't possible during the warmer months of the year.
<h3>Winter Backpacking Tips - Sights and Sounds</h3>
Winter backpacking opens up a whole new world that you are not exposed to with summer backpacking. For those who are willing to go out in to the snow, there are plenty of opportunities for seeing something new.

The first winter backpacking tip, then, is to have the courage to go winter backpacking. As long as you leave the house prepared, winter weather wont be much of a worry. Just like summer backpacking, you need to prepare. But if you are prepared, then there are things like frozen lakes, snow covered forests and empty trails to greet you, which make winter backpacking more than worth it.
<h3>Winter Backpacking Tips - Gear</h3>
Being prepared is the best winter backpacking tip, and when you will be spending the night in the outdoors, being prepared comes down to the gear you bring with you.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - First on the list of winter backpacking tips for gear is a winter tent. If you can be sure that you wont run in to any foul winter weather than a summer tent will usually hold up fine. Wind, blizzards and the other uglier forms of winter weather can flatten and soak a summer tent in no time, however, so if there is the possibility of foul weather, bring a proper four season tent with you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - On the tent floor you should have a winter sleeping pad. The cold ground will absorb a lot of your body heat, and so another good winter backpacking tip is to bring along a winter sleeping pad with a little insulation built in. The insulating layer will absorb and reflect body heat, whereas that heat might seep right out of a summer sleeping bag. Consult the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/sleeping-pad-r-values/\">sleeping pad R-value</a> page to learn more about this.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - Finally, a winter sleeping bag will complete your winter sleeping system and keep you nice and toasty throughout the cold night. You might be tempted to try and supplement your summer sleeping pad with insulating layers and a sleeping bag liner, but a proper winter sleeping bag is a much safer option, especially if the weather turns ugly and you really need to hunker down in dipping temperatures.</li>
	<li><strong>Footwear</strong> - It goes without saying, but a good pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">winter hiking boots</a> are essential if you plan to spend any significant amount of time on the trail while winter backpacking. Keeping your feet dry and warm over a multi-day winter backpacking trip is crucial, and a good pair of waterproof winter hiking boots is the way to do it. Also consider a pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">hiking snowshoes</a> to introduce a little novelty in to your backpacking and keep you floating above, rather than slogging through, the deep snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> - One final winter backpacking tip with regards to gear is to bring along some proper insulating layers. When you're doing your cooking at night you will be thankful for the extra warmth, and if the temperature really dips you will be thankful at night in your sleeping bag for the extra warmth. Down is an excellent material for insulating layers because it packs small and weighs next to nothing. Mont Bell is to go to manufacturer for down insulating garments, and a couple of their best are the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> down inner parka, and the matching down inner pants, also in <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> models.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Backpacking Tips - Weather</h3>
One final winter backpacking tip is to consult a weather forecast before you head out. If you're going backpacking for more than a few days, long term forecasts shouldn't be relied on too much, but it helps to know what to expect.

<strong>But even if the weather might not be great for your winter backpacking trip, that's no reason to cancel. The important thing with winter weather is to be prepared. If you have the proper gear and the proper knowledge, there's no reason to cancel or postpone a trip on account of bad winter weather.</strong>"

Some winter camping equipment, like stoves and water filters, will be the same as your summer camping equipment. <strong>There are is a variety of winter camping equipment, however, that needs to be specially suited to the unique weather conditions found in the winter months.</strong>

Winter, after all, presents a few unique challenges to a camper that need to be mitigated for with camping equipment. Snow storms, for instance, can get ugly fast, and your summer camping equipment will quickly become inadequate. This can make your winter camping experience both unpleasant and potentially dangerous.

For that reason, it is always best to go in to the outdoors in the colder months prepared, with winter camping equipment.
<h3>Winter Camping Equipment Essentials</h3>
Here are a few essential winter camping equipment picks. You may need more or less, depending on the winter conditions in your area, but this list should at least get you pointed in the right direction.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is probably the most important piece of winter camping equipment that you can bring with you. Camping is never fun if you don't get a good night's sleep, and shivering all night is a sure fire way to not get much sleep. Do yourself a favor and leave your summer sleeping bag at home. Pick up a sleeping bag with a temperature rating suited to the kind of winter conditions that you are going in to.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - To protect you in your winter sleeping bag at night, another essential piece of winter camping equipment is a winter tent. Though a summer tent may do the trick for some winter campers, if there is a chance that the weather could turn ugly, if you are going to be camping for several days and cant trust a long term forecast, for instance, then you should plan for bad weather. A four season tent will better protect you against wind, rain and snow, and let you get some sleep at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - The final piece of winter camping equipment you will need to get a decent night's sleep is a winter sleeping pad. Winter sleeping pads typically come with a layer of foam or even down insulation on the better models, which traps and reflects the body heat that you would normally lose in to the ground at night. It helps boost the insulating properties of your sleeping bag, and if you are a cold sleeper, or your sleeping bag is only just warm enough for the conditions you are heading in to, then a winter sleeping pad is definitely a good idea.</li>
	<li><strong>Footwear</strong> - Good footwear wont be as necessary if you plan to stick close to the campfire for the entire camping trip, but that's never any fun, and a real winter camping experience wouldn't be complete without a little hiking and exploring. For that, you will need some good footwear. More specifically, some <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">winter hiking boots</a> that will keep your feet both dry and warm. Also consider a pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">hiking snowshoes</a> to add a little novelty to your explorations.</li>

Snow camping is a great experience, provided you come prepared to deal with a few of the challenges that camping in the snow presents.

<strong>If you can prepare for snow camping, then you can focus on having a good time, and there certainly are a lot of ways to have a good time snow camping.</strong> You probably wont have to share the wilderness with too many other people like you would in summer, for starters, and there are some fairly unique things to see, like sun covered forests, that you don't get to see any other time of the year.

So if you can find the time and proper equipment to go snow camping, the experience is well worth the extra effort.
<h3>Snow Camping - Gear</h3>
Here are a few pieces of snow camping gear to consider bringing with you so that you can stay comfortable and safe in the cold weather.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - One important piece of snow camping gear is a winter sleeping pad. If your winter sleeping bag has enough insulation then you may be able to forgo a winter sleeping pad, but the extra insulation that a winter sleeping pad will help to keep you toasty warm. Most of us lose quite a bit of body heat in to the ground when we sleep, and it is this exact thing that winter sleeping pads are designed to prevent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - The most important piece of snow camping gear you can bring with you is a good winter sleeping bag. Snow is cold, after all, and you want to stay warm at night so you can get a decent sleep. It's hard to get a decent sleep, however, when you cant stop shivering, so do yourself a favor and leave the summer sleeping bag at home. A winter sleeping bag is a good investment.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - A winter tent is another piece of snow camping equipment that you should strongly considering bringing with you for camping adventures in the colder months of the year. Winter weather is notoriously fickle, and can change quickly. To avoid having your summer tent flattened by a surprise blizzard, you should bring along a four season, winter camping tent. It will hold up better in wind and offer better waterproofing than a summer tent, which can make all the difference when trying to get a decent night's rest.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - One more important piece of snow camping equipment to bring along is a good insulating layer for lounging around camp. Snow is always cold, but a good insulating layer will go a long ways towards protecting you from the worst of the weather's bite. Down garments, in particular, make excellent insulating layers for around camp, and no one does down garments better than Mont Bell. In particular, they make a good parka for both <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women</a>, as well as a matching pair of pants, again for both <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Snow Camping - Safety</h3>
Snow camping is all about safety, because there are a lot of things that can go wrong in winter conditions that you just don't have to worry about in the warmer months of the year.

First and foremost, you should consult a forecast before you leave, so that you have a rough idea of what to expect in terms of weather. You should also bring along extra layers and extras of the essential items, like socks, so that if things get wet you can switch them out and stay dry yourself. Being wet and cold is no fun at all.

Good footwear will also be essential, especially if you are going to be spending time away from your camp. Again, you want to protect your feet from the wet and the cold as much as possible.

<strong>As long as you go prepared, however, you are bound to have a great time snow camping.</strong>"

Snow hiking, or going hiking in the snow, can be a pleasant change from the usual trail hiking. It gives you a chance to see the outdoors in a whole new way.

<strong>One of the best things about snow hiking, however, is the lack of other people on the trail. Summer hiking can often feel claustrophobic because of the large numbers of people who had the same idea to go for a nice day hike. </strong>Snow hiking, however, is not for everyone, and most other people will be indoors while you are out hiking.

And there are plenty of interesting things to see while snow hiking. Snow covered forests, for one, and winter wildlife, for another, are both fairly unique things that you just wont see in the summer months.
<h3>Snow Hiking - Safety</h3>
Snow hiking, however, should be approached with a certain amount of caution, because snow, and the cold temperatures that follow, present a lot more challenges to hikers than summer hiking does. Part of preparing for that is doing obvious things, like checking forecast before you leave for the day and having some idea of the trail you will be travelling on, since snow can sometimes obscure what is an otherwise obvious trail.

Another big part of being prepared for snow hiking before you leave the house, though is having the proper gear with you.
<h3>Snow Hiking - Gear</h3>
Here are a few ideas for snow hiking gear that you should be bringing along with you when you leave the house for the day.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - It should go without saying that when snow hiking, the most important part piece of gear you should be bringing is a good pair of snow hiking boots. They should do two things, which are keep your feet dry and keep your feet warm. Snow is wet, after all, and cold too, and wet, cold feet are a recipe for disaster. Consider bringing along an extra pair of socks too, just in case your feet do start getting wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Sun Protection</strong> - Another key piece of snow hiking gear is sun protection. Assuming you have managed to pick a good day to go snow hiking, the sun will be out, and that means sun reflecting off the snow. All that extra, reflected sunlight can burn exposed sun quickly, which is why sunscreen is a good idea. Also worth bringing along are a pair of sunglasses, because adding sun blindness to a sunburn is even less fun.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - One more piece of snow hiking gear that should be brought is a half decent insulating layer of clothing. When you're hiking you wont need to stay all that warm, but during breaks, or if something happens and you need to spend more time in the woods than you thought, an insulating layer will be an important item to have with you. Down is a great option because it is lightweight and packs extremely small, so you don't even know you're carrying it until you need it. Mont Bell is well known for their down garments, and makes a down parka in particular, which comes in <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> models, and a pair of matching pants, also in <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>, that get particularly good reviews. You should also bring along a pair of gloves and a warm hat, for the extremities.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - One more snow hiking item that you should consider bringing is hiking snowshoes. If the trail wont be well trodden, or if you are breaking trail, or even going off trail, then it will save you a lot of energy to walk across the top of the snow, rather than try and slog through the snow.</li>

<strong>There's few things a camping enthusiast likes better than a new piece of gear, which is why camping gifts are great for that person on your list that enjoys spending time in the outdoors.</strong>

If there is something that you think your gift recipient is missing, or if they broke something on their last camping trip, then you can easily fill that hole in their camping gear list. I've tried to include a few more exotic items on the list below, however, that most camping enthusiasts probably don't have, but wont be able to do without once they get their hands on them.
<h3>Camping Gifts List</h3>
Here are a few camping gift ideas for the camper on your list.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/737697/benchmade-530-serrated-locking-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmade 530 Serrated Locking Knife</a> - If you're looking for a piece of camping equipment that most camping enthusiasts don't have, but should, to give as a camping gift, then a camping knife is a good choice. This knife from Benchmade is lightweight, made of good quality steel and gets great reviews. Guaranteed to please just about any camping enthusiast on your list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Vault Bear Canister</a> - A bear canister is another camping gift idea that most campers do not have, but should. Wildlife getting in to your food is always a problem, but bear canisters are designed to keep them all out. Some national parks also require bear canisters be used when staying in the park, so a bear canister in the closet will probably one day come in handy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - There's nothing quite so important as getting a good night's rest when you're camping, and the NeoAir is one of the best sleeping pads on the market, and would make a great camping gift. Most campers already have a sleeping pad, but most campers also tend to not get a good night's sleep. Help them upgrade by getting them a better sleeping pad as a camping gift.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - SteriPEN is a new kind of water filter technology that uses UV light to treat water. It's faster and smaller than your average filter, and it's new enough that most camping enthusiasts wont have one, which makes it a safe camping gift to give.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-trail-trekking-pole\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Trekking Poles</a> - Most campers don't have trekking poles, but probably should. They take the strain off your knees, which tend to take a beating when carrying a heavy backpack, and can be useful around camp in a few other different ways. These trekking poles from Black Diamond are well reviewed, and would make a great camping gift.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's version</a>) - Most camping enthusiasts make do with fleece or wool for an insulating layer, but down is far better, and would make a great camping gift. Down packs smaller than other insulating materials and is lighter too, which any camping enthusiast will deeply appreciate.</li>

<h2>Lightest Sleeping Bags</h2>
<strong>When hiking or backpacking, it always pays to bring along the lightest sleeping bag you can find. </strong>You will have to carry the thing, after all, and it doesn't make much sense to carry a heavy sleeping bag when you could be carrying a light sleeping bag instead.
<h3>Light Sleeping Bags Features</h3>
Here are a few features common to many of the lightest sleeping bags on the market that you can look out for when sleeping bag shopping.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Shape</strong> - First and foremost, many of the lightest sleeping bags on the market are mummy shaped, rather than rectangular shaped. This cuts down on the amount of fabric needed without sacrificing much in sleep quality.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Material</strong> - Another important feature to look for when trying to find a light sleeping bag is the insulating material used. Synthetic insulation is good because it stands up to water well. Down, however, is much lighter than synthetic insulation, and it will pack down smaller too, saving you space. It's a trade off, but if you want a light sleeping bag, you should go with down.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lightest Summer Sleeping Bags List</h3>
To find even more of the lightest sleeping bags currently on the market, head over to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">lightweight sleeping bags list</a>.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marmot +30 Sleeping Bag</a> - This sleeping bag from Marmot is one of the lightest sleeping bags around chiefly because of the insulation that it uses. It comes with 900 fill goose down, which is extremely high quality stuff. It's good down to about 30 Fahrenheit, as the name implies, and weighs in at just <strong>630 grams</strong>, or 21 ounces. And it also won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2011</strong>. Definitely an excellent light sleeping bag.</li>

Hiking in <a href=\"http://www.shop-denali.com/Vibram-Fivefingers/3815/dept\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibram Five Fingers</a> is enjoyable, as long as you keep a few things in mind. <strong>As a hiking shoe, vibram five fingers are lightweight, well made and will give your feet adequate protection from the environment.</strong> There are a few things they wont do, however, and when hiking in vibram five fingers, you should keep a few things in mind....
<h3>Hiking in Vibram Five Fingers - Potential Problems</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Ankle Support</strong> - Vibram Five Finger, like any trail runner or <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-shoes/\">backpacking shoe</a>, don't provide you any ankle support. If you've got a 60 pound backpack on this is going to be a problem, but if you're practicing lightweight backpacking and have a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-backpacking-gear-list/\">lightweight gear list</a>, then you don't have anything to worry about. When you overload your backpack you need that ankle support. With a lightweight backpack, however, you wont run in to that problem.</li>
	<li><strong>Training Your Feet</strong> - There's nothing stopping you from throwing on a pair of <a href=\"http://www.shop-denali.com/Vibram-Fivefingers/3815/dept\" rel=\"nofollow\">vibram five fingers</a> and going hiking, but it probably wouldn't be a good idea. If you grew up wearing shoes that's what your feet are used to, and it will take time to adapt to hiking in vibram five fingers. Most people's feet suffer from hiking in well padded hiking shoes, and vibram five fingers offer much less protection than those padded hiking shoes. Try training your feet before you go hiking in vibram five fingers by wearing them around town and going on a few short hikes with them, working your way up to longer, more intense hikes with more weight on your back.</li>
	<li><strong>Traction</strong> - One thing that you'll quickly notice after a day on the trail with your five fingers is that they don't get the best traction, especially in muddy or otherwise slippery conditions. Some of the newer models come with traction on the bottom of the foot, which certainly helps, but if you prefer the original five finger models then you'll want to step lightly on slippery surfaces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hiking in Vibram Five Fingers - Benefits</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Walking Softy</strong> - Hiking in vibram five fingers isn't all about potential pitfalls, however. There are a number of benefits, including the fact that increased proprioception, which is the ability to sense, in this case, the ground beneath your feet, tends to also decrease the force with which you impact the ground, which reduces strain on joints. As hiking tends to be hard on joints and muscles, anything that reduces that strain, such as hiking in vibram fiver fingers, will help keep your joints from feeling sore at the end of a long hiking day.</li>
	<li><strong>Water</strong> - River crossings, beach walks and puddles are all a lot easier when hiking in vibram five fingers. Though you don't want your feet to be wet all day, the vibram five fingers dry quickly, and there's nothing wrong with wading right in to a river crossing while everyone else in hiking boots has to try to find some other way across.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Transitioning to Barefoot</h3>
Maybe your ultimate goal is not to be able to go<a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-barefoot/\"> hiking barefoot</a>, but hiking in <a href=\"http://www.shop-denali.com/Vibram-Fivefingers/3815/dept\" rel=\"nofollow\">vibram five fingers</a> is an excellent way to work towards that goal if you are interested in barefoot hiking. It will help toughen the muscles in your feet and, if you're interested in hiking barefoot, will make your feet better able to withstand that more intimate interaction with the ground. If you just want to go hiking in vibram five fingers your feet will eventually toughen up, and if and when you put your hiking shoes back on, all that extra padding on your toughened feet will allow you to breeze through a full day of hiking.

Something else to keep in mind is that you need to allow your feet to adjust to life without shoes. You might not realize it, but shoes have a subtle offset between the heel and the toes, just like a pair of high heels, only more subtle. And your feet are conditioned to this extra bit of padding, so when you remove it, your feet have to adjust to a heel that's suddenly slightly lower than it was before. If you think about how many years and miles you've spent walking around in shoes, it's obvious that you wont adjust to this new way of walking overnight."

<strong>Camping Hygiene can be the difference between enjoying yourself in the outdoors and being preoccupied, daydreaming about a shower and a bar of soap</strong>. The point of camping, hiking and backpacking, after all, is to enjoy the outdoors, so it makes sense to take along the necessary camping hygiene products to be able to do that.

Here are a few backpacking hygiene products that you should consider taking with you in to the outdoors, to make your time spent there more enjoyable and, ultimately, rewarding.
<h3>Camping Hygiene Products List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/730925/dr-bronners-organic-liquid-soap-travel-size\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dr. Bronners Soap</a><img style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src=\"https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=scrowed-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /> - Camp soap is the lynch pin of any camping hygiene kit. You'll need it for cleaning dishes, yourself and maybe even your clothes too. And rather than bringing along a different soap for each task, why not bring along one soap that does it all? Dr. Bronners is an all-in-one soap perfect for bringing camping with you. It can even be used as <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/camping-toothpaste/\">camping toothpaste</a>, provided you pick a good flavor, of course. Also consider picking up a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/634320/nalgene-drop-dispenser-bottle-2-fl-oz\" rel=\"nofollow\">dropper bottle</a> so you only have to bring as much soap as you need, and not the whole bottle of Dr. Bronners. See what other <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/camping-soap/\">camping soap</a> options there are.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-pocket-shower\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit Pocket Shower</a> - A portable shower is a great way to stay clean while in the outdoors, and is an ideal addition to your backpacking hygiene kit if you like to go to bed clean, rather than sweaty. The Pocket Shower from Sea to Summit weighs only 120 grams, or 4.25 ounces, has a 10 Liter capacity, comes with a convenient hanging cord and is black, so you can fill it with water when you get in to camp and let the sun warm it up for you while you set everything else up. A portable shower is the kind of camping hygiene product that you try once and then wonder how you ever went in to the outdoors without it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packtowl-personal\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Personal Packtowl</a> - It's difficult to have a shower without a towel, but you certainly don't want to be lugging around a big, heavy towel either. The MSR Personal Packtowl is the ideal compromise. It's light -- the smallest size is just 28 grams, or 1 ounce -- and comes in a variety of sizes. The material is extremely absorbent and dries quickly too, so you don't need a lot of towel to get dry, though you might need to wring it out once or twice to get the job done. They also get excellent reviews, so the Packtowl is a good choice to add to your camping hygiene kit. If you're looking for something else in a camping towel, take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/camping-towels/\">Camping Towels</a> page.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/tush-wipes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Liberty Mountain Tush Wipes</a> - Sure you could just take a roll from the bathroom at home, but this is backpacking hygiene, and there's something better than the roll from home. Tush Wipes, from Liberty Mountain come embedded with witch hazel, which is a natural astringent and anti-inflammatory, which helps with itching, irritation and burning. Wiping will feel so good that you'll have to restrain yourself from using them all in one sitting. Definitely an item worth adding to the camping hygiene kit.</li>

Winter hiking boots are an important part of any <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-gear-list/\">winter hiking gear list</a> because when in winter conditions it is critical that you can depend on your feet staying dry and comfortable. Foot problems in cold weather conditions can become real problems really fast, and it pays to have a good pair of winter hiking boots along with you to ensure that nothing goes wrong with your feet.

<strong>A good pair of winter hiking boots will have several things going for them, the chief one being that they are waterproof.</strong> Damp, cold feet is a recipe for disaster when out on a long hike, and above all else, you should be keeping your feet dry.

Typically you have two options for keeping your feet dry. One is a leather winter hiking boot. Leather makes a good waterproof layer, provided you do a minimal amount of upkeep. The other option you will typically see is synthetic boots with a GoreTex liner. GoreTex is good because it tends to breath quite a bit. Sometimes you see leather boots with a GoreTex liner, which can get heavy but is a good bit of redundancy to have when weather conditions get bad.

Beyond waterproofness, your winter hiking boots should fit well, because foot problems can always get bad fast on a long hike. Winter hiking boots should also have quality construction and quality materials. With some hiking gear it's ok to go cheap, but with winter hiking boots you should spare your feet a pair of boots that will have to be returned after a couple goes at the winter hiking trails.
<h3>List of Winter Hiking Boots</h3>
Here's a short list of winter hiking boots to peruse. I tried to pick a few highly rated boots in a few different categories to give you an idea of what's out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/salomon-beluha-wp-ltr-winter-boot-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salamon Beluha WP LTR Winter Boots</a> - These winter hiking boots from footwear manufacturer Salamon are good all around boot for the really cold conditions. They are waterproof but also include an insulating layer, so neither water nor the cold will get to your feet. If you head in to cold conditions, socks wont cut it, and it really does pay to have some extra insulation courtesy of your winter hiking boots. Here are a similar pair of <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/salomon-nytro-wp-winter-boot-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's winter hiking boots</a>, also from Salamon.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693828/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - These are a great example of a sturdy, no-nonsense pair of leather winter hiking boots. They are well constructed and come with an additional GoreTex liner, so you can be sure your feet will stay dry. They also seem to get a lot of points with reviewers for being sturdy and durable, so you can be sure they will outlast at least one season of winter hiking. A similar pair of <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/751256/zamberlan-310-skill-gt-hiking-boots-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's winter hiking boots</a>.</li>

<strong>Hikers love their gear, and there is no better gift for a person that enjoys the outdoors than a new piece of hiking gear.</strong>

A hiking gift can come in all shapes and sizes, but it will be best if the gift is something your gift recipient does not already have. If you know what a hiker is lacking in their gear bag, or even better, if you know that they broke something on their last hiking adventure, then that will make the perfect hiking gift.

But even for the hiker that has seemingly everything, there are a few hiking gift ideas that are outside of the box enough that your gift recipient will be pleasantly surprised when they tear open their gift.
<h3>Hiking Gift Ideas</h3>
A few hiking gift ideas for the outdoorsy person on your list.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - The SteriPEN technology is relatively new, and chances are the hiking aficionado on your buying list wont have one, which makes it an ideal hiking gift. The SteriPEN uses UV light, rather than a filter, to make water safe to drink, which cuts down on time and equipment. The Adventurer is the most popular SteriPEN model.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-trail-trekking-pole\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Trail Trekking Poles</a> - Trekking poles are one hiking item that a lot of hikers do not have, but which are useful, and the kind of thing you have to try to really get a feel for. Which makes them the ideal hiking gift for that special someone. These trekking poles from Black Diamond are well reviewed and are adjustable to a wide variety of lengths.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/793268/petzl-zipka-plus-2-led-headlamp\" rel=\"nofollow\">Petzl Zipka Plus 2 LED Headlamp</a> - Your gift recipient may already have a headlamp, but it's doubtful they have a headlamp this lightweight, which makes it a great hiking gift. Hikers like to upgrade, and a new, lighter piece of equipment is always a welcome treat.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/737697/benchmade-530-serrated-locking-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmade 530 Serrated Locking Knife</a> - A good, <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-camping-knife/\">lightweight hiking knife</a> is something that a lot of hikers neglect to carry with them, but should. Encounters with wild animals is one obvious reason, but just having a knife around camp can be a big help. This knife from Benchmade is popular with reviewers, made with good quality steel and is very lightweight, which hikers always appreciate. For these reasons it would make an ideal hiking gift.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - One of the hardest parts of hiking for many people is getting a good sleep at night. One good hiking gift, then, would be a new and improved sleeping pad for your gift recipient. The NeoAir won a Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2009, and has only gotten better since then. It is by far one of the best sleeping pads on the market, and is lightweight too, making it a great hiking gift. And after one night's sleep, your hiking gift recipient wont be able to thank you enough for helping them upgrade.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Vault Bear Canister</a> - Staying safe in the outdoors has a lot to do with keeping the wildlife from becoming interested in you and your camp. Most hikers tend to hang their food in a bag, but to really protect it, a bear canister is a much better idea, and makes a good hiking gift for the hiker who has everything. Also, some national parks require the use of a bear canister to stay overnight, so having one in the closet can really come in handy. This canister from Bear Vault is popular, and is more importantly endorsed by government parks.</li>

There are many excellent christmas gifts for hikers that will have the hiking enthusiast on your shopping list thanking you on christmas morning.

The challenge is finding something that they don't already have. If they recently broke something, or have been complaining about missing something, then that makes it easy, but i've included a few items below that most hikers don't have, but cant do without when they do get their hands on them.

<strong>Whatever you end up getting, however, hikers always love a new piece of gear, and you cant go wrong with a hiking themed christmas gift.</strong>
<h3>Christmas Gifts for Hikers List</h3>
A suggested christmas gifts for hikers.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gt-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Helle GT Knife</a> - Most hikers tend not to bring along a knife when they go hiking, but they should. Aside from the personal protection a knife offers, they tend to come in handy in a wide variety of situations, from cutting rope around camp to opening a stubborn food package. This knife from Helle is a classic design and made from high quality steel, and a great christmas gift for hikers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/outlet/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's</a>) - Hiking in the colder months of the year can make for a chilly experience. A down parka, however, will keep you warm far better than many other materials, and is a lot lighter too. These parkas from Mont Bell are high quality and made with 800 fill goose down, which is the good stuff. They would make great christmas gifts for hikers on your list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset</a> - If you want to whip up a gourmet meal while out hiking, there's nothing better to bring along to do the cooking in than a titanium cookware set. These make great christmas gifts for hikers because most hikers are making do with steel or aluminum cookware, which is much heavier than titanium. If there is one thing that hikers love, it is an upgrade to something lighter.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/742238/joby-gorillapod\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joby Gorillapod</a> - A lot of hikers like to bring their camera with them when they head in to the outdoors, but one difficult thing about the outdoors is that there is never anything level to set the camera down on for a group shot. The Gorillapod solves that problem with legs that can be manipulated to always be level.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - Access to clean water is always important when out for a hike, and if you need to refill, you will need some method of cleaning the water. The popular method is a water filter, but filters have too many moving parts and take a lot of effort to work and keep clean. But a UV filter, like the Adventurer, will have your water drinkable in just a few seconds with minimal fuss, which makes it a great christmas gift for hikers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped DownMat Sleeping Pad</a> - For the hiker who likes to turn a day trip in to an overnight excursion, a sleeping pad is an important piece of gear. For the colder months, however, the summer sleeping pads that most hikers have will be inadequate, and a warmer option is needed. The DownMat from Exped makes a great christmas gift for hikers because it comes with a layer of down built in, to trap trap body heat and reflect it, making sleeping overnight in cold conditions a warm and toasty experience.</li>

If you overhead the camping enthusiast on your list mentioning that they broke a piece of gear, or you heard them grumbling about something that they're missing, that's a good place to start when selecting a camping themed christmas gift.

<h2>Best Backpacking Tents</h2>
The best backpacking tent is going to be a lot different than the best camping tent, for instance, because when you are backpacking you have to carry your tent, often for quite a ways, and so the best backpacking tent is often going to be the lightest backpacking tent.

The best backpacking tents also tend to have a few common features.
<h3>Common Features of the Best Backpacking Tents</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Trekking Pole Supports</strong> - Though not all of the best backpacking tents are able to accommodate trekking poles as support poles, it is a feature that will certainly help save on weight, which is almost always greatly appreciated.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall Design</strong> - Another feature common to many of the best backpacking tents is a single wall design. Again, a single wall design helps cut down on extra weight, which is always the enemy of backpackers.</li>
	<li><strong>Small Profile</strong> - Besides sleeping, there isn't a lot to be done in a tent, and that includes sitting around. The best backpacking tents are often the ones that cut down on extra space, which in turn cuts down on extra weight.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Backpacking Tents - 1 Person</h3>
Here are a few of the best backpacking tents to consider.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Contrail</a> - Tarp Tent makes a wide variety of excellent backpacking tents and even four season tents, though the Contrail is definitely one of their best backpacking tents. It has all the features listed above, and is roomy enough for one, or two in a pinch. Tarp Tent is a favorite manufacturer of the lightweight backpacking community, and with good reason. I personally own the Contrail, and cant say enough good things about it. The weight is 1.53 pounds, or 696 grams.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-elite-tent-1-p-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Laser Photon 1</a> - UK manufacturer Terra Nova isn't well known to a lot of North Americans, but they make some really excellent, lightweight tents. The Laser Photon, in particular, weighs just 1.47 pounds, or 670 grams, and even comes with its own, specially developed lightweight tent pegs, which is real dedication to the lightweight backpacking philosophy.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL</a> - The Fly Creek from Big Agnes is a no nonsense lightweight tent, and one of the best backpacking tents from the big name tent manufacturers. It weighs just 1.87 pounds, or 850 grams, which is more than respectable for the mainstream market. It also gets a lot of great reviews, so definitely worth checking out.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Backpacking Tents - 2+ Persons</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Big Agnes Fly Creek Line</strong> - Similar to the above, Big Agnes makes a whole line of the Fly Creek ULs. There is a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">two man version</a>, which amazingly enough weighs only about 100 grams more than the 1 person version. There is also a <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/807368/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul3-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">three man</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-4-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">four man version</a> to choose from. They're all very lightweight tents with conventional designs.</li>
	<li><strong>Tarp Tent</strong> - Tarp Tent makes a wide range of excellent backpacking tents, many of which belong in the best backpacking tents category. One of their bigger tents that stands out is the <a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/rainshadow2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rainshadow 2</a>, which has a design similar to that of the Contrail but sleeps 3. It weighs 42 ounces, or 1.2 kilograms, and is a great choice if you are looking for a backpacking tent for a larger group.</li>

<h2>Best Hiking Backpacks</h2>
Hiking backpacks are always an important piece of gear because they are the main piece of gear that you are interacting with while hiking. A poorly designed backpack, or a backpack that isn't packed correctly can cause a lot of pain over the long run, and can turn an otherwise enthusiastic hiker off of hiking.

There are a few features that are common to most of the better hiking backpacks on the market.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lightweight</strong> - One of the most important features of any of the most popular hiking backpacks is the weight of the backpack itself.

	<li><strong>Frameless</strong> - Although this will depend on how much gear you are carrying, the best possible hiking backpacks are <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/frameless-backpacks/\">frameless backpacks</a> or else have only a minimalist frame.

Before heading out for a day of hiking, it's always best to consult a good hiking gear list so that you know you aren't forgetting anything that you are going to end up needing.

<strong>After all, there's nothing worse than stopping for lunch and realizing that you've forgotten your sweater, or even worse, your lunch.</strong>

If you are doing a day hike you probably wont need everything on this list, but if you are heading out for a night or two then you will probably end up needing more of what's on this hiking gear list.

So take what you need from this hiking gear list and enjoy your time hiking.

<h2>Down Sleeping Bags</h2>
When shopping for sleeping bags you have one big decision to make, which is whether to go with a synthetic sleeping bag or a down sleeping bag.

A synthetic sleeping bag offers a lot of benefits. The main benefit is that the synthetic material in a synthetic sleeping does not lose too much of its insulating capabilities when wet. Down, on the other hand, isn't much good for insulation when wet, so the last thing you want to do is get a down sleeping bag wet.

But as long as you can keep your down sleeping bag dry, there are a few really great benefits to using a down sleeping bag.
<h3>Benefits of Down Sleeping Bags</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight of Down Sleeping Bags</strong> - The chief benefit of down sleeping bags is that they weigh a lot less, on average, than synthetic sleeping bags. If you are looking for a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-sleeping-bags/\">lightweight sleeping bag</a>, then this is a huge benefit.</li>
	<li><strong>Size</strong> - Since down sleeping bags are typically able to achieve the same temperature rating with less insulation, they also tend to pack down smaller, which is great for a crowded backpack.</li>
	<li><strong>Shifting Insulation</strong> - Another great benefit of down sleeping bags is that you can actually shift the down around in a lot of them, unlike in synthetic sleeping bags. So on cold nights, you are able to shift some of the down from the bottom of the bag, where it doesn't do any good, to the top and sides, where it will help to keep you warm.</li>
</ul>
Here are a few of the best down sleeping bags that you will find on the market right now.
<h3>Best Down Sleeping Bags for Summer</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/adrenaline-3-season-bag-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Adrenaline 3-Season</a> - Winner of the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2008 and the Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Green Award in 2010</strong>, this is a down sleeping bag with some serious credentials. It's made with 800+ fill goose down, is good down to 20 degrees, and weighs in at a very respectable <strong>985 grams</strong>, or 35 ounces.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-highlite-sleeping-bag-35-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western Mountaineering HighLite</a> - This is another really great down sleeping bag. It weighs a very slim <strong>455 grams</strong>, or 16 ounces, and is good down to 35 degrees. It gets to that low low weight by using 850+ fill goose down. It also has a large, square baffling system that helps to keep the down where you want it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808962/marmot-plasma-30-sleeping-bag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marmot Plasma +30</a> - Winner of the<strong> Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2011</strong>, this is another excellent down sleeping bag for the summer months. It is good down to 30 degrees, as the name implies, but the really stand out feature of this down sleeping bag is the use of 900 fill goose down, which helps get the weight down to <strong>644 grams</strong>, or 23 ounces.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Down Sleeping Bags for Winter</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-super-spiral-down-exp-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L Super Spiral Down EXP</a> - Mont Bell is very well known for their down garments, but they do an equally good job with their down sleeping bags. This particular model is made with 800+ fill goose down, and weighs in at <strong>1559 grams</strong>, or 55 ounces, and a -20 temperature rating. What is great about Mont Bell sleeping bags, however, is the unique baffle design, which spirals around you, and helps to increase the warmth of the down sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/western-mountaineering-bison-gore-ws-sleeping-bag-40-degree-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Western Mountaineering Bison Gore WS</a> - There is nothing quite like a down sleeping bag on a cold winter night, and the Bison Gore does not disappoint in this regard. Plenty of 850+ fill goose down helps it achieve a very impressive -40 temperature rating, and at only <strong>2095 grams</strong>, or 74 ounces, it is on the light side for that temperature rating. The best feature of this down sleeping bag, however, is the <strong>Gore Stopper outer shell</strong>, which is water resistant, to keep the down inside from getting wet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/808964/marmot-plasma-15-sleeping-bag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marmot Plasma +15</a> - The warmer version of the Plasma 30+ from the above list, this down sleeping bag won the same <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2011</strong>, along with <strong>Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year Award, also in 2011</strong>. It's definitely a well recognized down sleeping bag. Besides the awards, it is made with 900+ fill down, is good down to 15 degrees as the name implies, and all for just <strong>864 grams</strong>, or 30 ounces.</li>

In summer it pays to wear a pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-shoes/\">backpacking shoes</a> because you typically don't have to worry about things like snow, rain and cold temperatures, but in the winter, you need a specific winter backpacking boot, or you risk having wet, cold feet for the duration of your backpacking adventure.

There are a few features that you should look out for when shopping for a pair of winter backpacking boots. <strong>One is waterproofing.</strong> On leather boots, waterproofing is typically provided by the leather itself, with a little help from waxes and similar products. Other synthetic boots typically use a GoreTex liner to provide waterproofing. Some leather boots double up on waterproofing and use a GoreTex liner in addition to the leather.

<strong>Beyond waterproofing there isn't a whole lot you want to have in a winter backpacking boot, besides a good fit and quality construction.</strong> Remember, blisters aren't fun, especially on the second day of a multi-day backpacking trip. Returning the boots after your multi-day backpacking trip isn't much fun either, so get a half decent pair that will last for more than one winter backpacking trip.
<h3>List of Winter Backpacking Boots</h3>
Here are a few of the better reviewed winter backpacking boots on the market. It's by no means complete, but the reviews on each of these winter backpacking boots clearly puts them at the top of the field.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/693828/asolo-tps-520-gv-hiking-boots-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Asolo TPS 520 GV Hiking Boots</a> - These winter backpacking boots from Asolo come with full leather uppers as well as a GoreTex liner for complete protection from the elements. They're not particularly light, coming in at 1730 grams, or 3 pounds, 13 ounces, but with a winter backpacking boot your first consideration should not be weight. Here's a similar <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/751256/zamberlan-310-skill-gt-hiking-boots-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/751256/zamberlan-310-skill-gt-hiking-boots-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\"> winter backpacking boot</a>.</li>

It has a GoreTex liner to keep you dry, but no leather, so it will breath a little more than some of the competition. More importantly, however, they weigh only 867 grams, or 30.6 ounces, which is less than many summer backpacking boots. They also won a Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2011, so you know they are a quality winter backpacking boot. If you're all about lightweight backpacking then these are probably the boots for you.

The protection of a shoe with the open air feel of going barefoot. Hiking sandals are the perfect combination of foot protection and air exposure. Hiking sandals are the ideal shoe for summer hiking and if you're on the fence about whether or not to try them I would encourage you to give them a try.
<h3>The Benefits of Hiking Sandals</h3>
There are a couple of great benefits to hiking sandals.
<ul>
	<li><strong>You can get your feet wet</strong>. River crossings, dashing around headlands at the beach, puddles, swamps, it doesn't matter, hiking sandals handle it all. You can get your feet as wet as you want because in a few minutes they'll be dry again and your hiking partners will be giving you dirty looks while their boots squish for the rest of the day.</li>
	<li><strong>No socks</strong>. Although you certainly could wear a pair of socks with your sandals, you don't have to. In the warmer months, which is when you would probably be wearing a pair of hiking sandals, this is a major bonus. It's also one less piece of clothing that you have to bring along.</li>
	<li><strong>Ventilation</strong>. Feet get sweaty when you're hiking, especially in the summer when it's hot. And even the most well ventilated shoe can have you sweating like crazy by the sixth or seventh hour on the trail. With a pair of hiking sandals you may still sweat, but your feet wont be wrinkly and blistered at the end of the day from having been confined inside a stuffy shoe.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Popular Hiking Sandals</h3>
Hiking sandals, like shoes, come in all different shapes and sizes.

First, for something a little more beefy, there's the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/707782/keen-newport-h2-sandals-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Keen Newport H2</a> hiking sandals. Keen makes a ton of hiking sandals and they do a great job of it. For a trail where dust or sand would be expected, something like this hiking sandal that protects your feet a bit more would be perfect.

Another popular hiking sandal manufacturer is Chaco. The<a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/chaco-z-2-unaweep-sandal-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Z/2 Unaweep</a> is one of their more popular hiking sandals, and looks more like your typical sandal than the Keen model above. For a rain forest trail or something less dirty and dusty a hiking sandal like this would be ideal."

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Bivy Bags?</h2>
Bivy Bags are not by any means a required item for most backpackers, and it's certainly possible to practice even lightweight backpacking without a bivy bag. <strong>But in combination with a tarp tent say, a lightweight bivy bag can keep you dry and warm on a stormy night without the weight and bulk of a tent, which will usually make for significant weight savings.</strong> But like any piece of backpacking gear, there's a big difference between the typical and the lightweight, as you can see over at the list of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/bivy-bags/\">list of lightweight bivy bags</a>.

The <a href=\"http://www.e-omc.com/catalog/products/360/Integral-Designs-Salathe-Bivy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Integral Designs Salathe Bivy</a>, for instance, is a claimed waterproof bivy bag (really unless it's made of plastic it's not 100% waterproof) that weighs in at 950 grams, or 2.1 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/moonlite-bivi-sack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Moonlite Bivi</a> on the other hand is another claimed waterproof bivy bag that weighs in at a slim 180 grams, or .4 pounds.....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Intergral Designs Salathe Bivy - 950 grams / 2.1 pounds
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Terra Nova Equipment Moonlite Bivy - 180 grams / .4 pounds
</strong></li>
</ul>
That puts the Terra Nova Equipment Moonlite Bivy at a little better than a fifth of the weight of its heavier competitor. If you take the time to compare bivy bags, on a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/bivy-bags/\">list of bivy bags</a> say, then it's easy to find the lightweight bivy bags and save yourself the extra aggravation of carrying around that unnecessary weight.
<h2>Common Features of Lightweight Bivy Bags</h2>
If you're carrying a bivy bag then you're probably already invested in lightweight backpacking, but even so there are some differences between the heavy bivy bags and the lightweight bivy bags.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Fabric Choice </strong>- The problem you'll encounter with lightweight bivy bags is the same one you'll encounter with lightweight tents, which is that you need the bivy bag to breath while at the same time keeping moisture out. With this in mind, most of the weight savings that you'll see in lightweight bivy bags come from the choice of fabric. Some will use different fabrics for the top and bottom, making the bottom of a more durable fabric in the theory that it will be in contact with the ground and suffer more abrasion and moisture exposure as a result. Of course, it's debatable how effective some of these lighter fabrics are at keeping water out. Water Proof is a relative. But if you choose your campsite well and have some form of shelter overhead it'll be difficult to get wet.</li>
	<li><strong>Bug Netting </strong>- Another common feature on a lot of bivy bags is bug netting for the face opening, which allows you to breath and be free of bugs. And though this bug netting doesn't weigh much, some bivy bags do forgo it. If you're camping somewhere that bugs aren't a problem this isn't really a concern, but if the bugs are out, one idea might be to use a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/camp-hike/camping-essentials/bug-sun-protection/bug-nets\" rel=\"nofollow\">bug head net</a> that you would wear during the day on the trail as a supplement to the lightweight bivy bag at night, giving the bug head net two uses. The <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/bivy-bags/\">list of bivy bags</a> page lists which bivy bags on the market come with the bug net feature.</li>

<h2>Drawbacks of Lightweight Bivy Bags</h2>
Lightweight Bivy Bags are a great way to go backpacking, provided that you know what you're doing. In the summer a lightweight bivy bag makes a good alternative to a tent, but when the weather turns ugly you'll be wishing you had that tent. One system that seems to work well for people is to use a lightweight bivy bag in conjunction with a tarp tent, which provides good three season protection from the bugs and the elements while still being lightweight.

Like most lightweight backpacking gear, the drawbacks only become a problem when you don't understand the limitations of your lightweight backpacking gear. Being lightweight, this kind of gear is less forgiving of mistakes, but with a little knowledge and experience you wont be making mistakes."

<h2>Best Sleeping Pads</h2>
Making a list of the best sleeping pads for backpacking isn't easy, but for the purposes of this list I've defined best on criteria such as weight, reviews, reputation, and features, to give a well rounded picture of what some of the best sleeping pads on the market are.

Here are a few of the best sleeping pads to choose from.
<h3>Best Sleeping Pads List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/inertia-x-frame-sleeping-pads\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klymit Inertia X Frame</a> - If for nothing more than its innovative design the Inertia X Frame deserves a spot on any list of the best sleeping pads. The minimalist design significantly cuts down on weight while still giving you support in all that right places.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.summithut.com/products/peak-oyl-elite/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacific Outdoor Equipment Peak Oyl Elite</a> - Pacific Outdoor Equipment is an underrated sleeping pad manufacturer. The Peak Oyl Elite is a sleeping pad that would do well in summer as well as winter without being overly heavy. The ridges on the side are a nice touch too, and help to keep you on the sleeping pad at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/781096/therm-a-rest-neoair-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - Therm-A-Rest makes a lot of sleeping pads, but the NeoAir is by far their most popular and would be a big omission from any list of the best sleeping pads. The horizontal ridges make it a unique design, while the low weight is surprising for a rectangular sleeping pad. But the sheer number of positive reviews for this sleeping pad are what set it apart from the rest of the competition.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped Downmat 9</a> - The Downmat 9 is an ideal sleeping pad for those cold winter nights. The down insulation and high R-value mean that it's an ideal sleeping pad for even the coldest conditions, and yet it still remains relatively light, giving it a place among the best sleeping pads.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://kookabay.com/luxlite.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kooka Bay LuxLite</a> - A little known manufacturer popular with the lightweight backpacking crowd, Kooka Bay has some deceptively innovative designs that manage to pack a lot of features in to a very small amount of weight. If your idea of the best sleeping pad is a fine balance of comfort and weight the LuxLite should be a serious consideration.</li>

A <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/best-camping-knife/\">camping knife</a> is useful, but if you're spending some time in the outdoors a multi-tool might be a better choice to take with you. Most multi-tools include at the very least a knife, pliers and a bottle and can opener, all of which can be indispensable tools to have in any number of backpacking, camping or hiking situations.

<strong>Here are a few of the best multi-tools for backpacking.</strong> They're all highly rated and come from well established brands that have a history of making quality knives and multi-tools. A few have even won awards.
<h3>Best Multi-Tool for Backpacking List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/skeletool-cx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leatherman Skeletool CX</a> - The Skeletool CX from Leatherman won the Best of Adventure Gear award in 2008 from National Geographic magazine, which definitely helps to cement its position among the best multi-tools for backpacking. It includes a knife, several different pliers and cutters, a bottle opener and several other features, but is fairly minimalist. It weighs 142 grams, or 5 ounces, which is must lighter than most multi-tools, and is extremely well reviewed by customers. If you're looking for a multi-tool, the Skeletool CX would be a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sog-knives-powerlock-multi-tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">SOG Knives PowerLock Multi-Tool</a> - This multi-tool from manufacturer SOG knives has no shortage of features. It includes all the standards like a knife, pliers, cutters, and bottle and can openers. It also includes scissors, a wood saw, a file and a few more features too. It also gets excellent reviews. It weighs 272 grams, or 9.6 ounces, so not the lightest multi-tool, but if your best multi-tool for backpacking is the one with the most features, the PowerLock is a great choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/715771/leatherman-new-wave-multi-tool\" rel=\"nofollow\">Leatherman Wave Multi-Tool</a> - Leatherman is well known for making quality knives and multi-tools, and all the positive ratings indicate that the Wave lives up to that reputation. It has a few more features than the Skeletool. Besides the basics it has a wood saw, scissors and a file, plus a few more, so you wont lack for a tool in most situations. It weighs 240 grams, or 8.5 ounces, and based on the positive reviews is one of the best multi-tools for backpacking currently on the market.</li>

<strong>When preparing for a winter camping trip it really helps to consult a winter camping gear list to make sure that you aren't forgetting anything essential. </strong>Winter camping is a lot more unforgiving than camping in other seasons, and forgetting even one piece of essential gear can make a winter camping trip very unenjoyable.

The most important thing to remember with winter camping is that winter weather is unpredictable, and that you should leave home prepared for a variety of different scenarios. This is where the gear comes in. By taking gear that is meant for winter conditions and by not trying to supplement summer camping gear, you will be far more prepared for everything that mother nature can throw at you in the outdoors.

Things like snow, rain and wind are perfectly fine, as long as you consulted a winter camping gear list before you set out.
<h3>Winter Camping Gear List</h3>
Here are a few essential items that are a must for any winter camping gear list. Most other camping items, such as stoves and water filters, will be fairly similar between summer and winter months.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - You should definitely not bring a summer sleeping bag when you go winter camping. A winter sleeping bag should be at the top of your winter camping gear list, because the temperatures will be drastically different than in summer, and a summer sleeping bag will be inadequate and will leave you shivering all night long. Do yourself a favor and bring a proper winter sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Though it isn't totally necessary, you should at least consider bringing along a winter sleeping pad to go along with your winter sleeping bag. A winter sleeping pad will have an extra insulating layer along the top of the sleeping pad that will trap and reflect heat given off by your body. And contrary to what you might think, you do lose a lot of body heat in to the ground when you sleep.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - Another essential item on any winter camping gear list is a winter tent. If you don't expect much wind or moisture then a summer tent will be passable, but if there is a chance you will experience some ugly weather while winter camping then it is a good idea to include a winter tent on your winter camping gear list. A winter tent will be stronger, and better able to stand up to wind. It should also be a bit more waterproof, to keep you drier than a lighter, summer tent would.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulation</strong> - Spending time around the campfire or in camp can get chilly quickly, which is why a few insulating layers are a good addition to your winter camping gear list. Mont Bell makes some excellent down products, such as a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>) and a matching pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a>).</li>
	<li><strong>Footwear</strong> - If you plan to spend most of your time in camp then footwear wont be such a big concern, but if you are planning on doing a little walking around while out winter camping, then good footwear should be at the top of your winter camping gear list. More specifically, a good pair of <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">winter hiking boots</a> and maybe even some <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">hiking snowshoes</a>.</li>

HIking presents are great for that special someone on your list that loves the outdoors. One reason being, there is few things that outdoor enthusiasts like more than a new piece of gear to test out and use.

Below are a few suggestions on hiking presents. If you know someone who recently broke a piece of gear, or are missing an obvious piece of gear, then that makes a great present idea.

<strong>And if you're looking for the perfect hiking present that a special someone probably doesn't have, but will fall in love with, then the list below can help.</strong>
<h3>Hiking Presents List</h3>
A few hiking present suggestions.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Vault Bear Canister</a> - Most hikers make do with hanging their food in a bag from a tree. This system wont fool a clever bear, however, and rodents have no problem with it. That's why a good hiking present to give is a bear canister. It protects against bears and most other wildlife, and is even required for staying overnight in some national parks. Definitely a good choice for the hiker on your list.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-jacket-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Jacket</a> (and the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montbell-alpine-light-down-jacket-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's model</a>) - Most insulating fabrics like fleece are heavy, which is why a down jacket, like this one from Japanese manufacturer Mont Bell, is great. Down is far lighter than other insulating materials, and packs smaller too, which any hiker will appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset </a>- Most hikers make do with aluminum and steel cookware, which works well but is very heavy. So treat the hiking enthusiast on your list to a hiking present of titanium cookware, so they can upgrade. It's the kind of hiking gear that you didn't know you needed until you have it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780949/outdoor-research-dry-ditty-sacks-set-of-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outdoor Research Dry Ditty Sacks</a> - Stuff sacks are always ripping and getting abused, and they often need to be replaced. Some replacement stuff sacks, then, make a great hiking present because sooner or later the hiking enthusiast on your list will need them, as their own stuff sacks succumb to wear and tear. This set of three from Outdoor Research gets top marks from reviewers, and would make a great hiking present.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - The Adventurer by SteriPEN is a new and improved kind of water filter just making its way on to the market. It uses UV light, rather than the old filter system, to make water drinkable. It's faster and less cumbersome than a traditional filter, and is the kind of thing most hikers don't even know about yet, making it a great hiking present.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped DownMat Sleeping Pad</a> - Most hikers will have a sleeping pad, but very few will have a winter sleeping pad, which exactly what the DownMat is. It uses a layer of down on the top of the sleeping pad to keep the sleeper warm during the night. It makes a great sleeping pad during the winter, or any cold night, and is the kind of thing you don't know you need until you have it.</li>

<strong>There are a lot of snowshoes on the market, but if you're going to be spending significant amounts of time in a pair of snowshoes you want the best snowshoes, the ones that you will be able to depend on day after day.</strong>
<h3>Best Snowshoes Features</h3>
There are a couple of important features of snowshoes that you should look out for when selecting the best snowshoes for yourself.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Weight Load</strong> - One is the recommended weight load of the snowshoes. You can buy the best snowshoes you can find, but if they wont carry your weight, if they just sink in to the snow when you use them, then they are useless. <strong>Related to this, the best snowshoes for women will often have a smaller surface area than the best snowshoes for men, since women weigh less than men.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Snowshoe Weight</strong> - Another feature to take in to account when looking for the best snowshoes is the weight of the snowshoes themselves. <strong>It's estimated that every pound on your feet is equivalent, in terms of energy expenditure, to five pounds on your back</strong>. So when you add your boots, and then a heavy pair of snowshoes on top of that, you can see how you will get tired fast if you don't pick a pair of lightweight snowshoes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Snowshoes for Men</h3>
Here are a few of the best snowshoes for men, depending on what you plan to use them for.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/atlas-run-snowshoe\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlas Run Snowshoes</a> - These snowshoes are designed for light, quick travel over a snowy trail. They weigh just 1224 grams, or 2.7 pounds for the pair, and have a good binding system to keep your feet secure while you're moving quickly. The recommended load is 75 to 190 pounds. If you're looking for the best snowshoe to allow you to get a little running in when the weather turns ugly, these snowshoes from Atlas are a good bet.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/evo-ascent-snowshoes\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR EVO Ascent Snowshoes</a> - The Ascent snowshoes from MSR are a little heavier, weighing in at 1816 grams, or 4 pounds, but are good with a load up to 250 pounds with the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/flotation-tails-evo-ascent-6\" rel=\"nofollow\">removable tails</a> attached, so they are good for a variety of activities such as hiking or backpacking. they are plastic, however, so maybe not the best snowshoes for you, but they do get some great reviews so definitely worth checking out.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805326/msr-lightning-ascent-30-snowshoes\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - This version of the Ascent snowshoe from MSR is similar to the version above, with a few key differences. One is the improved load capacity, which tops out at 280 pounds. Another is the material, which is aerospace-grade aluminum for the frame and specialized nylon for the deck, rather than plastic. They also have their own version of the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lightning-tails\" rel=\"nofollow\">removable tail</a> system. The slightly beefier design will, however, cost you in the weight department, as these are the heaviest snowshoes on the list, weighing in at 2012 grams, or 4.4 pounds. If you're looking for quality materials over weight, this version of the Ascent snowshoes may be the best snowshoes for you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Snowshoes for Women</h3>
Some of the very best snowshoes for women currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/791651/atlas-1227-elektra-snowshoes-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlas 1227 Elektra Snowshoes</a> - These are some of the best snowshoes for women currently found on the market. They feature an aluminum frame and a nylon deck, which is the combination that most snowshoes use for a reason. The Elektra snowshoes are recommended for anywhere from 120 pounds to 200 pounds, which is less than many men's snowshoes, but then women weigh less then men, so this is perfectly fine. They weigh 3.75 pounds, or 1900 grams, so they're not the lightest snowshoes, even for a pair of women's snowshoes, but the extra weight means extra durability.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-lightning-ascent-snowshoe-womens-cas0624\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Lightning Ascent Snowshoes</a> - These women's snowshoes from MSR feature a few slightly different materials that make them stand out from the crowd. They feature aircraft aluminum for the frame, and urethane instead of the more traditional nylon for the deck material. They are slightly narrower than the men's version, but this is standard for a women's snowshoe. They can also carry up to 250 pounds of weight, so you can load plenty in to your backpack and still walk on the surface. They weigh in at 3.6 pounds, or 1664 grams, so fairly lightweight, and MSRs serrated edges, so you get plenty of grip, even in treacherous conditions.</li>

<strong>Hiking snowshoes will be different from other snowshoes, the most important difference being their load capacity. </strong>Backpacks always add a few pounds, even in summer when gear demands are much less. In winter, however, you are generally taking more gear, and heavier gear, to contend with the weather and the safety concerns that winter weather can sometimes bring on.

Which means your backpack weighs more, and your snowshoes will need to be bigger and better to help carry that extra weight. If your snowshoes cannot take the weight they will sink, and you will expend a lot more energy when hiking. To accommodate that extra weight you should pick up a pair of hiking snowshoes, as there are some snowshoes on the market that are made for running, for example, or for quick romps in the snow, where weight isn't such a concern.

Beyond that, you want to at least consider the weight of your snowshoes. Hiking snowshoes will tend to be bigger, and weigh more as a result, but you should always try for lightweight hiking gear because all other things being equal, you tend to have more fun when you carry less weight.
<h3>Hiking Snowshoes</h3>
Here are a few well reviewed hiking snowshoes to consider if you're looking for a pair of hiking snowshoes, or just wondering what's out there.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/805227/atlas-1235-snowshoes\" rel=\"nofollow\">Atlas 1235 Snowshoes</a> - These hiking snowshoes from Atlas feature an aluminum frame and nylon deck, which is fairly standard for snowshoes. The load capacity goes up to 300 pounds, which is ideal for just about anyone, unless you've volunteered to carry gear for the whole group. They weigh in at 2097 grams, or 4.6 pounds, so you wont be saving on weight, but they're an all around good snowshoe, so definitely worth checking out.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lightning-axis-snowshoes\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Lightning Axis Snowshoes</a> - The Lightning Axis from MSR is one of several hiking snowshoes that MSR carries. MSR has a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/lightning-tails\" rel=\"nofollow\">removable tail system</a> that makes their snowshoes ideal for hiking and backpacking, because you can tailor the load capacity of the snowshoes, depending on how much gear you plan to take and how much you weigh. MSR also puts traction spots on the frames of their snowshoes, so you get good grip in a wide variety of conditions. The load capacity goes up to 300 pounds, with the removable tails attached, so definitely a hiking snowshoe worth considering.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/tubbs-mountaineer-series-snowshoe-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tubbs Mountaineer Series Snowshoe</a> - It says mountaineer right in the name, so they cant be that bad. These hiking snowshoes from Tubbs are beefy. They weigh in at 2579 grams, or 5.7 pounds, so not very light compared to other models, and the biggest model is 36 inches in length, whereas a lot of other hiking snowshoes only top out at 30 inches. The load capacity tops out at 300 pounds, which is fairly standard, but if you're not concerned about weight and are looking for something bullet proof, these might be the hiking snowshoes for you.</li>

Winter weather is a lot different than the summer weather that most hikers are used to, and it helps to look over a few winter hiking tips before you head out for a day of hiking so that you do not forget anything important.

<strong>As long as you remember all the important things, however, winter hiking can be a lot of fun, and a every unique experience. So plan ahead with a few winter hiking tips and enjoy yourself in the outdoors.</strong>
<h3>Winter Hiking Tips - Gear</h3>
Being prepared in the outdoors is all about having the right gear with you. This is especially true in the winter months, when the weather can be much less forgiving and change very quickly. Here are a few winter hiking tips regarding the necessary gear to take.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - First and foremost of the winter hiking tips regarding gear is the need to bring a proper set of winter hiking boots for your trek. <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/backpacking-shoes/\">Backpacking shoes</a> are great during the summer months, but during winter you need something that is first, waterproof, and second, warm. A proper pair of winter hiking boots will do both.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">Hiking Snowshoes</a> - If you plan to be out in the snow then you should definitely consider hiking snowshoes. One of the best winter hiking tips I can give you is to enjoy yourself in the winter conditions, and snowshoes are a great way to enjoy the snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Sun Protection</strong> - Bad weather is typical for a day of winter hiking, which is why good weather is always such a welcome relief. Another winter backpacking tip is to plan for the good weather, and bring along a few things. <strong>Sunscreen</strong>, for one, to protect exposed skin from sun reflected off the snow. And similarly, you should bring <strong>sunglasses</strong>, as reflected snow can easily cause snow blindness.</li>
	<li><strong>Insulating Layers</strong> - You may be nice and toasty while working hard, hiking, but when you stop, to take in the view or eat a bit of food, you will get cold quickly, which is when it's nice to pull out a layer insulation to slip on. Not all insulation is created equal, however, and so another winter hiking tip is to bring along down insulation, which is both lightweight, packs small and provides plenty of warmth. If you don't have any down insulation, Mont Bell is a Japanese manufacturer that makes great down products, including a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> parka and a <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">men's</a> and <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's</a> matching set of pants. <strong>Also consider bringing a warm hat and a pair of gloves with you, to help keep your extremities warm.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Winter Hiking Tips - Weather</h3>
Another good winter hiking tip is to be mindful of the weather. Consult a weather forecast before you step out the door, and be sure to bring along more insulation than you think you will need.

Of course the winter weather conditions are one of the main attractions of a day spent winter hiking, and if you can find a sunny day you will have great views and wont have to worry so much about winter weather turning ugly. A good winter hiking tip, then, is to pick the sunny day after a big storm, when there is plenty of snow on the ground but the sun is out.
<h3>Winter Hiking Tips - Sights and Sounds</h3>
One of the best things about winter hiking is that there are often very few people sharing the trail with you. You get to experience the natural world without all the overcrowding that can sometimes ruin summer hiking trips. The lack of people may help you see sights and sounds, like winter wildlife, that might otherwise be scared off by the large amounts of people.

Winter weather also offers up a few different sights that you wont see during the summer. Snow, for one, can create a lot of really stunning vistas that you wouldn't otherwise see.

Snow covered ground and a pair of<a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\"> hiking snowshoes</a> can also give you access to a lot of places that would be difficult to get to during the summer months, when excess ground cover might block your path. <strong>The best winter hiking tip is to respect winter weather conditions, but to not be afraid of exploring them.</strong>"

Camping presents make great gifts for the wilderness enthusiast on your list who has everything, the simple reason being that every camper loves a new piece of gear.

<strong>The list below includes a few items that most campers wont have, and a few that will be welcome upgrades.</strong> If your camping enthusiast has broken a piece of gear in the near past, or has been complaining about not having a certain piece of gear, then those make great ideas for camping presents too.
<h3>Camping Presents List</h3>
A few camping present suggestions for that special someone on your list.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/exped-downmat-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped DownMat Sleeping Pad</a> - It's true that any self respecting camper will already have a sleeping pad. What they probably wont have, however, is a cold weather sleeping pad. This DownMat from Exped uses a layer of down to help trap and reflect body heat lost in to the ground at night, making it much warmer than the average sleeping pad, and a great camping present.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer </a>- For the camping enthusiast who has everything, a SteriPEN is a great camping present. It's a new technology that uses UV light instead of physical filters to clean your drinking water. It's faster than a traditional filter and smaller too, which any camper will appreciate.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780949/outdoor-research-dry-ditty-sacks-set-of-3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Outdoor Research Dry Ditty Sacks</a> - Stuff sacks make the perfect camping presents because they're always getting ripped and torn, and in need of replacement. So even if the person you are buying a camping present for doesn't need a stuff sack now, they will sometimes in the future. This set of three covers all the basic sizes, and is a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/668927/snow-peak-titanium-multi-compact-cookset\" rel=\"nofollow\">Snow Peak Titanium Multi Compact Cookset</a> - Cookware is typically heavy, but not if you have a titanium set. Most campers make do with steel or aluminum sets, so a titanium set will be a welcome upgrade to most campers, and a great camping present.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/outlet/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Down Inner Jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's</a>) - Insulating layers is one area where campers typically grab whatever is warm and old from the closet. A goose down jacket, however, makes a great camping present because it is almost certainly better than whatever is in the closet. Down is lighter and packs smaller than anything, and these parkas from Mont Bell are some of the best on the market, which makes them a great camping present for someone looking to stay warm.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Vault Bear Canister</a> - Nobody lasts long in the wilderness without any food, and bears and rodents can make short work of improperly stored food. Most campers make do with hanging their food from a tree,but this system is far from bear proof. Make a proper food storage canister a camping present for them, and they will never lose their food to the wildlife again.</li>

<strong>Having a GPS along with you when you are hiking is a great example of technology making the outdoor experience safer and a lot more fun.</strong>

The best hiking GPS will have a few different features that you should look out for, because when hiking, the best GPS for the job is going to be a lot different than the best GPS for other activities, like finding your way around in the city or while driving.
<h3>Best Hiking GPS Features</h3>
Here are a few of the features common to many of the best hiking GPS devices.
<ul>
	<li><strong>Durability</strong> - One feature that any of the best hiking GPS devices will have is a certain amount of durability. The outdoors is no place for delicate electronics, and any GPS device that you take in to the wilderness should be up for a little wear and tear.</li>
	<li><strong>Weight</strong> -  Another feature common to most of the best hiking GPS devices is a low weight. Electronics are never extremely lightweight, but anything that you take in to the outdoors should be light enough that you don't consider leaving at the side of the trail.</li>
	<li><strong>Battery Life </strong>- Carrying around extra batteries is the last thing you want to do, so the best hiking GPS devices should also have a good battery life.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Hiking GPS List</h3>
Here are a few of the best hiking GPS devices currently on the market.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-etrex-legend-h\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garmin Etrex Legend</a><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/garmin-etrex-legend-h\" rel=\"nofollow\"> H GPS System</a> - The Extrex Legend from Garmin is definitely one of the best hiking GPS devices on the market.

	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/804438/magellan-explorist-gc-gps\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magellan eXplorist GC GPS</a> - The eXplorist, the Magellan, is another of the best hiking GPS devices on the market, particularly if you like to mix geocaching in to your hiking. It comes with a 30 day premium membership for geocaching.com, and 500 megabytes of memory to store maps. The bright color screen and 18 hour battery life are also great features.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gps-satellite-messenger\" rel=\"nofollow\">SPOT Satellite GPS Messenger</a> - The GPS Messenger by SPOT is a unique kind of hiking GPS device.

If you're looking for a GPS device to offer you a little peace of mind the back country, then this is the best hiking GPS for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/816864/garmin-forerunner-610-gps-heart-rate-monitor\" rel=\"nofollow\">Garmin Forerunner GPS Heart Rate Monitor</a> - If you're looking for something to monitor your workouts, double as a watch and help you navigate in the bush when you get turned around, this is the best GPS device for you.

<h2>Lightest Backpacks</h2>
Backpackers and hikers often put a lot of thought in to the weight of the things that go in to their backpacks, like <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-tents/\">tents</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-sleeping-bags/\">sleeping bags</a>, but then fail to think about the weight of their backpacks.

<strong>But many of backpacks suffer the same kind of needless heaviness that other pieces of gear do, and you should try as much as possible to find the best possible lightweight backpack.</strong>

With that in mind, here are a few features common to many of the light backpacks that you will find when shopping for your next backpack.
<h3>Light Backpacks Features</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Frameless</strong> - The main feature common to many light backpacks is the lack of a frame. Internal frames are great if you are carrying a huge load, but if you've got a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightest-sleeping-bags/\">light sleeping bag</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightest-tents/\">light tent</a> and light everything else, then you don't need a frame.</li>
	<li><strong>Fabric</strong> - Another important feature of many of the lighter backpacks on the market is the choice of fabric. <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/dyneema-backpacks/\">Dyneema backpacks</a>, for instance, are often some of the best ultralight backpacks you will find because dyneema is both lightweight and strong.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lightest Frameless Backpacks</h3>
There are even more light backpacks at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">lightweight backpacks list</a>.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=25&amp;products_id=103\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain Laurel Designs Exodus</a> - The Exodus is one of the best lightweight backpacks that you have probably never heard of. Lightweight backpackers know it well, however, which is why it won the <strong>Backpacker Magazine Reader's Choice Award in 2011 for Best Ultralight Backpack</strong>. It weighs a very slim <strong>425 grams</strong>, or 15 ounces, making it such a light backpack, you will barely even know it's there.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - ULA Equipment is another brand that not too many people outside of the lightweight backpacking community have ever heard of. This is another one of the lighter backpacks that you will find on the market, however, constructed out of dyneema and with a number of well thought out features that make it an easy choice when shopping for a light backpack. It weighs in at <strong>481 grams</strong>, or 17 ounces.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-35-lightweight-backpack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser 35</a> - The Laser 35, from UK manufacturer Terra Nova, has a very unique design that you probably wont see on too many other backpacks. It features one long zipper right down the back of the backpack, giving you instant access to the guts of your backpack. It weighs just <strong>467 grams</strong>, or 16.5 ounces, making it another of the lightest frameless backpacks that you will find currently.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lightest Frame Backpacks</h3>
The <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/backpacks/\">lightweight backpacks list</a> has hundreds more of the best backpacks to look at.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://gossamergear.com/packs/backpacks/mariposa-plus-ultralight-backpack.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gossamer Gear Mariposa</a> - Gossamer Gear is one more light backpack manufacturer that you have never heard of. Even with an internal frame, though not a very big one, the Mariposa manages to weigh in at just <strong>658 grams</strong>, or 23.2 ounces, which is far lighter than much of the mainstream competition. It's constructed with ripstop nylon, and comes in several different sizes for a more customized fit.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/ohm.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment OHM</a> - Another backpack from light backpack manufacturer ULA Equipment. This one features a carbon fiber frame, so you don't waste any weight for improved load control. It's made with dyneema, and features a lot of the ULA Equipment touches, like a spacious perforated back pocket where wet clothes can be stored to dry while on the move, that define the ULA Equipment brand. It weighs <strong>640 grams</strong>, or 22.6 ounces, which makes it one of the lightest backpacks with a frame you are likely to find.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/780219/osprey-exos-46-pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Osprey Exos 46</a> - The Exos 46 is a more conventional backpack from a more mainstream backpack manufacturer. It has a more robust frame, but still manages to weigh only <strong>1050 grams</strong>, or 37 ounces. It also won a <strong>Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award back in 2009</strong>, so you know it's one of the best light backpacks you will find.</li>

	p.content = "<p>Rain Gear is always a bit of a problem, because you&#39;re always in a trade off between breathability on the one hand and waterproofness on the other. It&#39;s possible to stay dry in some truly horrendous conditions, but you&#39;ll probably end up sweating yourself wet, and likewise a highly breathable rain system is going to get you wet from the outside in. The manufacturers below have not solved this dilemma, but they&#39;ve at least attempted it in a lightweight way, which is something at least.</p>
<p>One other note, is that those looking to trim every ounce of weight might want to look in to a tarp / poncho system. This is where your rain gear consists of a poncho which converts in to a tarp. In the summer for example, or on a trip where you&#39;re reasonably sure you&#39;re not going to be the victim of any particularly bad rain storms, this is a great way to save weight, which is why it&#39;s one of the most popular dual use pieces of gear.</p>

<p><strong>GoLite</strong></p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.golite.com\">GoLite</a> is a well established lightweight company. Though some of their products do drift towards the heavier side of things, they make a lot of excellent gear.</p>
<p><strong>Integral Designs</strong></p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.integraldesigns.com\">Integral Designs</a> is a manufacturer that uses mainly eVent fabric for their waterproof products. eVent is similar to Gore-Tex, though typically lighter and cheaper. They also carry a few poncho / tarp combinations.</p>
<p><strong>Mountain Laurel Designs</strong></p>
<p><a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/\">Mountain Laurel Designs</a> don&#39;t make much as far as clothing goes, but what they do make is fairly innovative. They have rain chaps, eVent mitts, and a cuben fiber poncho / tarp combination, among other things.</p>

<p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in; font-weight: normal\"><a href=\"http://www.westernmountaineering.com/\">Western Mountaineering</a>&nbsp;is another company that makes an impressive down insulating product.

	p.content = "It can't be overstated how important the weight of your footwear is. It's been said that <strong>every pound on your feet is equivalent to five pounds on your back</strong> in terms of energy expenditure. And your average pair of hiking boots can easily weight four pounds, meaning you're carrying the equivalent of a twenty pound backpack on your feet. Given that your goal should be a ten pound backpack, a twenty pound backpack for your feet seems like overkill.

For this reason, many ultralight hikers elect to use trail runners or some equivalent as their shoe. Granted, a trail runner is not going to have the durability of a well made boot, but like everything else it's a trade off. And contrary to what you might think, there are many trail runners that are waterproof, and even some that provide ankle support, though with a light enough backpack ankle support isn't really necessary.

<em>For reviews of various hiking shoes and boots, see <a href=\"http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/reviews/category_display?cid=53&amp;cat=Footwear%20%2D%20Boots%2C%20Shoes%2C%20Gaiters\">here</a>.</em>

<strong>Inov-8</strong>

When it comes to trail runners made for hiking, one of the best brands is <a href=\"http://www.inov-8.com/\">Inov-8</a>. Many of their <a href=\"http://www.inov-8.com/New/Global/Product-Catagory-SelectUK.html?L=26\">products</a> have won awards, and they're <a href=\"http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/reviews/category_display?cid=53\">well liked by ultralight hikers</a>. Many of their shoes come with Gore-Tex liners for keeping moisture out, and they even have a few pairs of shoes that look like full on hiking boots, though none of their shoes, not even the imitation hiking boots, weigh more than 400 grams (14.1 oz). Definitely a company worth checking out for your next pair of hiking shoes.

<strong>Montrail</strong>

Another brand worth mentioning is <a href=\"http://www.montrail.com/default.aspx\">Montrail</a>. Their shoes tend to run a touch heavier than Inov-8's, but too offer features like Gore-Tex liners and they've worn their share of awards too, and are <a href=\"http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/reviews/category_display?cid=53\">well liked by ultralight backpackers</a>, so definitely worth checking out."

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Tents?</h2>
<strong>Tents can be one of the heaviest pieces of gear in a backpack, which is why it's such a good idea to consider lightweight tents.</strong>

A quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">list of tents</a> shows you just how much variation there is in weight.

The <a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-photon-1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon tent</a>, on the other hand, is another 1 person, 3 season, 2 wall tent. But the Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon weighs in at just 670 grams, or 1.5 pounds.......
<ul>
	<li><strong>Sierra Designs Zolo - 1700 grams / 3.75 pounds
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon - 670 grams / 1.5 pounds</strong></li>
</ul>
Same basic features, but more than a two pound difference between the two. Your back will thank you for choosing the lightweight tents.
<h2>Common Features of Lightweight Tents</h2>
For something as simple as an enclosure to sleep in, tents come with a surprising amount of options, and the more lightweight tents have a few more innovative features that you'll want to be aware of.
<ol>
	<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-trekking-poles/\">Trekking Pole</a> Supports </strong>- A lot of the lightweight tents that you'll find on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">tents list page</a> use trekking poles or, if you're not a fan of trekking poles, single lightweight poles as their means of support. The benefit of this for those that use trekking poles is the trekking poles become a dual use item, meaning you don't have to carry any tent poles. How much can a tent pole really weigh, you ask? More than no tent pole.</li>
	<li><strong>Innovative Fabrics </strong>- Fabric being the main ingredient of any tent, many lightweight tents use as light a fabric as possible. The lightest fabric currently in use by tent manufacturers is Cuben Fiber. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-ultra-1-p-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Ultra tent</a>, for example, is advertised as the lightest 2 wall tent on the market (and is, according to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tents/\">lightweight tents list</a>), and gets there by using Terra Nova's proprietary \"ULTRA\" fabric. Spinnaker cloth is also very popular, and though not as light as Cuben Fiber, it's more durable.</li>
	<li><strong>Single Wall Tents </strong>- Another common feature you'll find on lightweight tents is a single wall design. Fabric being the heaviest thing about a tent, it makes sense to cut the amount of it in half if at all possible. Double wall tents use the outer layer to repel moisture coming in, and the inner layer to let moisture generated inside the tent (generated by breathing, for instance) leave through permeable walls. Single wall tents have to do both jobs with only one layer of fabric, but by using unique ventilation schemes and innovative fabrics single wall tents do an excellent job, allowing you to save weight.</li>
	<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-tents/\">Tarp tents</a></strong> - Some lightweight tent manufacturers forgo the idea of a tent entirely and give you either a tent without a bottom or else just a square piece of fabric to shelter under. This certainly cuts down on weight, but isn't for everyone. This does however allow you to potentially use your tarp as your rain gear as well, which drastically cuts down on your weight, and is another way to include dual use pieces of gear in your backpack. See for example the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/poncho-tarp\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Poncho Tarp</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Trade Offs of Lightweight Tents</h2>
There are some trade offs that must be understood when considering lightweight tents. For one, fabric durability can sometimes be an issue. Cuben Fiber, for instance, gradually breaks down as a result of sun exposure, and so a cuben fiber tent isn't going to last forever. That said, you wont find many cuben fiber tents on the market, at least partially for this reason.

Another issue to be aware of is winter suitability. If you're experienced and you know what you're doing, there's no reason that you cant, for example, use a tarp tent in winter conditions. But experience and knowledge are the key. You have to be aware of wind conditions, the potential weather, and how to pick a good campsite among other things, because the minimalist designs of lightweight tents wont be as forgiving as a bigger, bulkier, sturdier tent. With the right knowledge and experience though, you can plan around the drawbacks of lightweight tents in winter conditions."

Looking at other people's lightweight backpacking gear lists are a great way to get ideas about your own lightweight backpacking gear list. Sometimes they provide insights in to the ways other people manage to cut corners and save weight. You also get to see what equipment other people are buying, which can give you ideas on how to fill a hole in your own lightweight backpacking equipment. But it's always fun to see that your lightweight backpacking gear list is better than someone else's too.

Below I've provided a few sample gear lists of the essential items most lightweight backpackers would need for a summer camping trip. Further down the page I've also provided a few links to sample lightweight backpacking gear lists elsewhere on the web that you can probably learn something from.

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Sleeping Bags?</h2>
Sleeping Bags, together with backpacks and tents, are part of the 'Big Three', the three items that will weigh the most in the typical backpack. <strong>Which means that considering lightweight sleeping bags will go a long way towards lightening your load.</strong> And as you can see at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">list of sleeping bags</a> the average sleeping bag is not the lightest piece of gear. Take for example the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/778929/marmot-trestles-0-sleeping-bag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marmot Trestles</a> sleeping bag, which is a bag rated to 0 °F, weighing 2401 grams, or 5.3 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-spiral-down-hugger-0-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #0</a> on the other hand is another 0 °F sleeping bag that manages to weigh only 1162 grams, or 2.5 pounds....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Marmot Trestles - 2401 grams / 5.3 pounds</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #0 -  1162 grams / 2.5 pounds</strong></li>
</ul>
Two sleeping bags with comparable features and capabilities, but the Mont Bell U.L. Spiral Down Hugger #0 uses better fabrics and fill material to be less than half the weight of the other. Your back will thank you for choosing lightweight sleeping bags after a long day of backpacking.
<h2>The Features of Lightweight Sleeping Bags</h2>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Down Sleeping Bags </strong>- Down is almost always going to be the fill material of choice for lightweight sleeping bags. And there are many different qualities of down, known as the fill power. The Mont Bell sleeping bag I referenced above, for example, has a fill power of 800+, which means that the down in that bag will loft more than say 600+ down, which means you'll be warmer for the same amount of weight. The highest fill power sleeping bags I've seen is <a href=\"http://www.nunatakusa.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">950+ from Nunatak</a>, but perhaps it could go even higher? (genetically modified geese perhaps?)</li>
	<li><strong>Quilt Sleeping Bag </strong>- One of the more innovative features of lightweight sleeping bags is the quilt sleeping bag. A quilt sleeping bag is, as you might have guessed, a sleeping bag without a bottom. Either side of the quilt will usually have straps which, in conjunction with your sleeping pad, keep the quilt lashed down and you toasty warm. You can see, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ultralite-1-season-quilt-800-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite UltraLite 1+ Season Quilt</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Clothing as Insulation </strong>- Another way to lighten the load is to take a lightweight sleeping bag that has a temperature rating that is slightly inadequate for the weather that you're expecting on your trip. You can then supplement the warmth of the sleeping bag by wearing some or even all of your clothing. You wont smell nice at the end of the trip, but your backpack will be that much lighter.</li>
	<li><strong>Pair with a Bivy Bag </strong>- Similar to the clothing idea above, you pair your sleeping bag with a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-bivy-bags/\">lightweight bivy bag</a>, giving you an extra bit of insulation and raising the temperature inside your sleeping bag.</li>
	<li><strong>Half Length Sleeping Bags </strong>- There are a few manufacturers that make sleeping bags that are less than full length. The idea is that you keep your lower body warm with the sleeping bag and wear a well insulated jacket to keep your upper body warm, which makes your insulating jacket a dual use item. There aren't too many of these being made, but to see what's available, check out the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-bags/\">list of lightweight sleeping bags</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drawbacks of Lightweight Sleeping Bags</h2>
Some of the various features of lightweight sleeping bags have the potential to leave you a little cold at night, should you fail to plan properly. Using clothing as insulation, for instance, means that you have to keep a careful eye on the weather report before you go. If the weather took an unexpected turn someone with a better insulated sleeping bag would be able to put their clothes on to stay warm, whereas you're already wearing your clothes as part of your sleep system, and don't have that extra buffer. Also, down is a great insulator, but when wet performs badly compared to synthetic sleeping bags. When using a down sleeping bag, you have to take extra care to remain dry.

Like most pieces of lightweight backpacking gear, lightweight sleeping bags are less forgiving of mistakes than the heavier sleeping bags. But with a little knowledge and experience, you can avoid the mistakes and enjoy lightweight sleeping bags."

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Sleeping Pads?</h2>
A good sleeping pad can mean the difference between a good nights sleep and one spent rolling around and counting cricket chirps. And in theory ultralight sleeping pads offer less comfort, but if you know what to look for that's not always the case.

<strong>But how much lighter are lightweight sleeping pads? </strong>According to the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">list of sleeping pads</a>, quite a bit lighter. Take for instance the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hinman-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Hinman sleeping pad</a>. It's an inflatable sleeping pad that has 1.5 inches of thickness when inflated, and weighs in at 1190 grams, or 2.6 pounds. The <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/inertia-x-frame-sleeping-pads\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klymit Inertia X Frame sleeping pad</a>, on the other hand, is another inflatable sleeping pad that comes in at 1.5 inches thick when full of air. However, it only weighs 257 grams, or .56 pounds....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Big Agnes Hinman - 1190 grams / 2.6 pounds</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Klymit Inertia X Frame - 257 grams / .56 pounds</strong></li>
</ul>
Granted, the Klymit Inertia X Frame is a rather uniquely designed sleeping pad, (click on the link above to see what I mean) but it is comparable in comfort and even R-Value if the advertising is to be believed, and it weighs almost a fifth of what its heavier competitor does. That right there is the difference that shopping around for light sleeping pads can make.
<h2>The Features of Light Sleeping Pads</h2>
You'll find a few common features that manufacturers use to make lighter sleeping pads.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Foam Sleeping Pads </strong>- A quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/sleeping-pads/\">sleeping pads list</a> says it all. The top 5 lightest sleeping pads are all foam, and there's only 1 full length inflatable pad (no surprise, it's the Inertia X Frame from above) that manages to crack the top 10. For lightweight backpacking, it's hard to beat a foam sleeping pad.</li>
	<li><strong>Half Length Sleeping Pads </strong>- Another popular innovation amongst manufacturers of light sleeping pads is the half length sleeping pad or the three quarter length sleeping pad, or even the two thirds length sleeping pad. Something less than full length anyway. (see the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sim-light-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exped Sim Light </a><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/sim-light-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">sleeping pads</a> for an example) The idea is that you use the pad under your torso and hips and possibly head, depending on what length you're using, and then use backpacks, clothes, or whatever else you've got with you to prop up and support the rest of your body.</li>
	<li><strong>Lighter Fabrics </strong>- Ultralight sleeping pads often incorporate lighter, thinner fabrics in to their designs in an effort to reduce weight. With a lighter fabric, your chances of getting a puncture from a rock underneath you is going to go up. Many manufacturers use a lighter fabric on top and a slightly tougher fabric underneath to combat this, but as long as you're relatively careful in picking a camping spot, you shouldn't have to worry about this too much.</li>
	<li><strong>R-Value Zones </strong>- Some of <a href=\"http://pacoutdoor.com/sleeping-pads\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pacific Outdoor Equipment</a>'s line of sleeping pads have a rather unique feature. The inner sleeping pad, where your torso would be if you were laying on it, has extra insulation, which ups the R-Value. Outer areas of the sleeping pad, where arms and legs would be in contact with the sleeping pad, are less insulated. Since the part of you that most needs to stay warm is the torso, this makes a lot of sense, and definitely saves on weight.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Drawbacks of Light Sleeping Pads</h2>
It's generally true that the lighter you go with a sleeping pad, the greater your chances are that you wont get a good nights sleep on the trail. What this comes down to is knowing what kind of sleeper you are. If you toss around a lot at night, perhaps a square sleeping pad is the better choice, instead of a mummy sleeping pad. Do you need padding? Foam sleeping pads are probably out for you then, and you'll have to go to the somewhat heavier inflatable sleeping pads.

Be honest with yourself when choosing a sleeping pad, because not getting enough sleep on the trail can turn an otherwise great trip in to a miserable experience."

<h2>How Backpacking Quilts Work</h2>
The idea behind backpacking quilts is that when you're in a sleeping bag, the sleeping bag underneath you is being crushed down by your weight. In a sleeping bad the thing that's keeping you warm is the loft, or thickness of the sleeping bag, meaning that the more loft there is between you and the outside world, the warmer you're going to be. So when the sleeping bag beneath you is being crushed down, its ability to keep you warm is drastically reduced. So why not get rid of it entirely, and save the weight?

The problem with this is that there's the possibility of the sleeping bag coming off to one degree or another during the night, making you cold and probably waking you up. Which isn't any fun. There are a few different ways that backpacking quilt manufacturers address this, but two of the more popular are to have either straps that link the two sides of the quilt together, underneath your sleeping pad, or else have excess fabric on either side of the quilt, which you lay on, holding the sides of the quilt in place.
<h2>Why Use Backpacking Quilts</h2>
<strong>The main reason you would use a backpacking quilt instead of a normal lightweight sleeping bag is the weight that can be saved.</strong> By removing that excess fabric and fill material you're significantly lightening the weight of your sleeping bag.

Another good reason to use backpacking quilts is that you can more easily ventilate your sleeping bag should the bag be too warm for the weather you find yourself in. This gives the sleeping bag greater versatility, and makes for more comfortable nights in warmer than expected weather.
<h2>Potential Drawbacks of Backpacking Quilts</h2>
There are several potential drawbacks of using backpacking quilts that you should be aware of. The first is that as mentioned above, there's the chance of something coming loose and your warm cocoon of a sleeping bag springing a leak, letting cold air in and hot air out. But this really depends on what kind of a sleeper you are. If you could be mistaken for being dead while sleeping, then this probably wont be a problem, but if you thrash, it might be worth trying to test a backpacking quilt before you commit to buying one.

The second drawback, though you might not see it that way, is that backpacking quilts don't come with hoods. A toque or some other head warming device works as a replacement, but I personally keep my hair short and have always appreciated the extra warmth that a hood provides for my head. (Check out the <a href=\"http://www.nunatakusa.com/site07/other_bags/catabatic_sl.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nunatak Catabatic SL</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/haven-20-sleeping-bag-700-down\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest Haven 20</a> to see two exceptions to the no hood rule)

Is barefoot hiking a good idea? Will I hurt myself? Do people actually go hiking with bare feet? For many people hiking without shoes is an alluring idea, but there are a lot of unknowns and not much information out there on this unique way of taking to the trail. But as someone who's done it, I can tell you that it isn't all that scary provided that you know a few things going in.
<h3>Transition in to Barefoot Hiking</h3>
Hiking without shoes on is not the kind of thing that you want to jump in to. Try going for a walk barefoot and you'll quickly see what I mean. The skin on the bottom of our feet is capable of becoming extremely tough and resilient, to the point where you can walk on just about anything barefoot without any discomfort. But it takes time to get there. Keep in mind too that when you're hiking barefoot you'll have that extra weight from the backpack to contend with. It's in a situation like this where lightweight backpacking really pays off, because if you're barefoot hiking the soles of your feet will thank you for leaving those extra twenty or thirty pounds at home.

A second step might be <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/brand/Vibram\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibram Five Fingers</a>, which are less intimidating than they look and will allow you to interact with the ground without actually having to get your feet dirty.</li>
	<li><strong>After you're comfortable with a more minimalist shoe it's time to take the shoes off entirely and start really breaking your feet in</strong>. Above all this process takes time, and patience is required because calluses aren't made overnight. Transitioning to barefoot hiking will be a process. Start out on grass and smooth surfaces like concrete and gradually work your way up to full on trail. Before you know it you'll be barefoot hiking without any problems.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Are There Other Barefoot Hikers?</h3>
Yes there are. In fact there are two sisters, Lucy and Susan Letcher, who've hiked the entire Appalachian trail from one end to the other and back again while hiking barefoot. They have a couple of books on the experience.

<h2>Best Camping Tarps</h2>
Ranking the best of anything is difficult, but for this list of best tarps for backpacking or camping I've judged best on several different things including weight, reviews, reputation, and features so that you can find the best camping tarps available.

Here are a few of the best camping tarps that qualify under those criteria.
<h3>Best Camping Tarps List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/poncho-tarp\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Poncho Tarp</a> - A list of camping tarps wouldn't be complete without at least one <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/poncho-tarp-tents/\">poncho tarp</a>. The Poncho Tarp from GoLite is one of the lighter poncho tarps on the market and if your idea of best camping tarp is versatility the Poncho Tarp from GoLite would be a good choice.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.zpacks.com/shelter/hexamid.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">ZPacks Hexamid</a> - If you're willing to use Cuben Fiber then the Hexamid from ZPacks is an obvious choice of camping tarp. The Solo version ranks at #1 by weight on the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/tarp-tents/\">lightweight tarp tents list</a>, so if weight is your main criteria for best camp tarp then consider the Hexamid.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.bozemanmountainworks.com/?do=showproduct&amp;id=50\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bozeman Mountain Works Stealth NANO X</a> - The Stealth NANO X is made from another very lightweight but less known fabric called Hi-Bias Spectra Mylar. The innovative fabric means the Stealth NANO X comes in only a few grams heavier than the Hexamid, making it the #2 camping tarp by weight and again, if weight is your chief concern as far as best camping tarps goes then consider the Stealth NANO X.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/810040/msr-e-wing-shelter\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR E-Wing</a> - If you don't want to have to worry about extremely lightweight fabrics that are a little on the delicate side then something like the E-Wing might be for you. It's never going to win any awards for weight, but it's a more durable fabric that will stand up better to use and abuse.</li>

It's difficult to make an objective ranking for something like best backpacking shoes, but for this list I've used a few different criteria including weight, reviews, reputation,and features.

I've also broken things up in two different categories to help you find the best backpacking shoes for you.
<h3>Best Backpacking Shoes - Summer</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/montrail-mountain-masochist-ii-trail-running-shoe-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Montrail Mountain Masochist</a> - Montrail is well known by lightweight backpacking enthusiasts for their backpacking shoes, and the Mountain Masochists are some of their best reviewed backpacking shoes. The tops are breathable to help keep sweat from building up and just the right amount of cushion keeps your feet going all day long.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/inov-8-x-talon-212-trail-running-shoe-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8 X-Talon 212</a> - The X-Talon 212s weigh in at a scant 212 grams, making them an excellent choice for anyone who considers weight to be an important part of what best backpacking shoes means. The lugged bottoms mean they don't do well on roads but excel on the trail, and Inov-8s innovative designs means your feet will be sensitive to what's beneath you without being fatigued.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798244/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vibram Five Fingers Sprint</a> (<a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798168/vibram-fivefingers-sprint-multisport-shoes-womens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's</a>) - Some people love them and some hate them, but the Vibram Five Fingers are definitely an option for those looking to have a good feel for what's beneath their feet while keeping the weight down. Vibram Five Fingers are also versatile around water and a good choice for beach hiking or where there are constant rivers to cross. The Sprint is one of their classic designs and the open top makes it an ideal choice for summer backpacking. If minimalism and versatility are a part of best backpacking shoes for you then consider the Sprints.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Best Backpacking Shoes - Winter</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ems.com/product/index.jsp?productId=3834894\" rel=\"nofollow\">Montrail AT Plus GTX</a> - There's no reason you cant take a pair of backpacking shoes out for a little four season backpacking. They would likely be out of place on a snowy mountain top, but the Goretex lining will help keep your feet dry in most wet conditions and the excellent Montrail design will keep your feet comfortable. If you're worried about the weather throw a pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/salamander-gaiters-37522\" rel=\"nofollow\">waterproof gaiters</a> in to your bag for good measure.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://store.mpgear.com/inov-8-roclite-400-gtx-hiking-boot.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inov-8 Roclite 400 GTX</a> - The look and protection of a backpacking boot with the weight and features of a backpacking shoe. These Roclites from Inov-8 are leather with a Goretex liner and the full ankle protection of a backpacking boot, but include many of the innovative features that make Inov-8 backpacking shoes such a common choice for lightweight backpacking enthusiasts. Definitely consider the Roclite 400s when looking for the best backpacking shoes.</li>

<h2>Top Tents</h2>
These are a few of the best tents on the market right now. They're popular, well reviewed and would be a good choice to take with you hiking, backpacking or camping.
<h2>Top 1 Person Tents</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/laser-photon-elite-tent-1-p-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon 1</a> - The Laser Photon 1 is an excellent lightweight tent from Terra Nova, a UK manufacturer. Terra Nova isn't all that well known in North America, but is one of the best tent manufacturers in Europe. The Laser Photon weighs 670 grams, or 1.47 pounds, and in terms of weight is one of the better tents you can buy. Terra Nova even developed their own, lightweight tent pegs to further reduce the weight, which makes it clear that this is a manufacturer dedicated to their products and their customers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 1</a> - The Fly Creek 1 from Big Agnes is another of the very best tents on the market. It doesn't weigh much, just 850 grams, or 1.87 pounds, and is rated extremely well by customers. It's a fairly small tent, but a usable size, and is easy to set up.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is one of several one person tents from Tarp Tent, a small tent brand popular in the lightweight backpacking community. The design is innovative, which means the tent weighs 696 grams, or 1.53 pounds, but is also well ventilated and roomy enough that two people could squeeze in.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Top 2 person Tents</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2</a> - The Fly Creek 2 is the 2 person version of the Fly Creek line of tents from Big Agnes, which are some of the lightest freestanding tents currently being made in their respective capacities. And it only weighs just over 100 grams more than the 1 person version, coming in at 963 grams, or 2.12 lbs. The weight, or lack thereof, the consistent positive ratings and the reputation make it a dependable tent in the 2 person capacity category.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/carbon-reflex-2-tent-2-person-3-seas\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Carbon Reflex 2</a> - The Carbon Reflex 2 won an Adventure Gear of the Year award from National Geographic magazine back in 2009, which speaks to the quality of the product and also helped to make it that much more popular with customers. It weighs 1210 grams, or 2.66 pounds, and is a dependable and well built 2 person tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/crescent-2-shelter-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell Crescent 2</a> - The Crescent 2 has been designed to use just a single pole, which helps to cut down on weight and has led to a few other innovative design features as well. Mont Bell, the manufacturer, is known more for sleeping bags and down garments than tents, but just like their more famous products they use excellent materials and innovative designs, and their tents are guaranteed not to disappoint. The weight of the Crescent 2 is just 1162 grams, or 2.56 pounds, and it includes ample ventilation to keep you dry at night.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Top 3+ Person Tents</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/rainshadow2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Rainshadow 2</a> - The Rainshadow 2 is a popular tent with lightweight backpackers, but not a tent you're likely to find in your local outdoors store. The minimalist design provides plenty of room for three to sleep at night, and the ample ventilation at both ends of the tent will keep condensation from building up. And the weight, which is 1135 grams, or 2.5 pounds, is better than most two person tents, and significantly better than just about any other three person tent you're going to find.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-3-tent-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 3</a> - The Fly Creek 3 is the next step up in the Fly Creek line of products from Big Agnes. The tent weighs 1445 grams, or 3.18 pounds, which is a considerable jump from the 2 person model, but still much lighter than most other 3 person tents on the market, which is why it is still one of the best tents to buy. You can also take a look at the 4 person version, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-4-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 4</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sierra-designs-lightning-xt-4-tent-4-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra Designs Lightning XT 4</a> - The Lightning XT is one of the better tents from manufacturer Sierra Designs. In 2009 it won an Editor's Choice award from Backpacker magazine, which helped to confirm its excellent design and manufacturing quality. It's roomy, and isn't especially light at 3150 grams, or 6.94 pounds, but then a four person tent is never going to be especially light.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Bear Canisters are an indispensable, and sometimes legally required piece of backpacking equipment when heading in to bear country</strong>, but they can also be heavy pieces of equipment, which is why it pays to do your research on lightweight bear canisters.

To get a better idea as to where bear canisters are required in the Sierras, visit the <a href=\"http://sierrawild.gov/bears/food-storage-map\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sierra Wild website</a>. Note that bear canisters are also required in some Alaskan parks, such as Denali.

Though bear canisters are not required in most other parks in the United States, black bears are still prevalent throughout much of the wild places of the United States and Canada, and taking a bear canister along, and especially a lightweight bear canister, is never going to be a bad idea.
<h3>Lightweight Bear Canisters List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/709075/counter-assault-bear-keg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Counter Assault Bear Keg</a> - The Bear Keg from Counter Assault is one of the heavier bear canisters currently on the market, weighing in at 1.9 kilograms, or 4 pounds and 4 ounces. Still, it's large enough to store 6-8 days worth of food and meets the U.S. Forest Service specifications, so it's not going to be a bad choice in that regard. It also helps that it gets good reviews.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">BearVault Bear Canister BV450</a> - The BV450 is one of the most popular bear canisters on the market, no doubt in part because it is also one of the most lightweight bear canisters on the market. It weighs just 935 grams, or 2 pounds and 1 ounce, which is less than half of the Bear Keg above. It also only has capacity for about 4 days of food, but that's fine if you're looking for a <strong>lightweight bear canister for a shorter trip</strong>. It is black bear approved by the Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group, which handles the specifications for the Sierras. It is also grizzly bear approved by the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, and it gets plenty of 5 out of 5s too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/bear-vault-bv500-bear-resistant-food-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">BearVault Bear Canister BV500</a> - The BV500 is the bigger version of the Bear Canister built by BearVault. It can carry somewhere around 7 days worth of food, depending on how much you like to eat, and weighs just 1162 grams, or 2 pounds and 9 ounces, which is considerably less than the comparable Bear Keg, <strong>making it the best choice if you're looking for a lightweight bear canister for a longer trip</strong>. Like the BV450, the BV500 is black bear approved by the Sierra Interagency Black Bear Group, which handles the specifications for the Sierras, and is also grizzly bear approved by Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee. There are lots of good reviews too.</li>

<strong>Dyneema backpacks fits well with the lightweight backpacking philosophy.</strong> If you're only carrying 20 or 30 pounds to begin with, there's no sense in adding more weight with heavy-duty backpack fabrics, because you don't need the carrying capacity that they provide. Heavy duty fabric is a good idea if you're carrying 60 pounds on your back, but who wants to carry 60 pounds on their back?

Here's a few of the better dyneema backpacks that you'll find on the market.
<h3>Examples of Dyneema Backpacks</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/golite-peak-backpack-2318cu-in\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Peak Pack</a> - The Peak Pack from GoLite is a fantastic dyneema backpack that's big enough to go for a week or more if you're packing light, but not so big that you cant use it as a day to day lightweight dyneema backpack. It weighs 745 grams, or 1.64 pounds, and has a 36 L capacity, which is ideal for a lightweight backpacker taking only the essentials. It has a zipper pocket on the back for quick access to a few essentials and a few different compression straps, which is important for stabilizing your load in a frameless backpack.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.ula-equipment.com/cdt.asp\" rel=\"nofollow\">ULA Equipment CDT</a> - The CDT from ULA Equipment is a favorite among the lightweight backpacking community, and with good reason. It's lightweight, coming in at only 481 grams, or 1.06 pounds, and has a couple of different features, such as large hip belt pockets, water bottle holders on the fronts of the shoulder straps and a mesh enclosure on the pack which make it a well designed frameless dyneema backpack. It also has the essential frameless backpack features, like a back pad and compression straps to help stabilize the weight.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/jam-pack-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoLite Jam Pack</a> - The Jam is one of GoLites oldest packs, though it has gone through a few redesigns since its inception. It's only gotten better with time though, and is similar in design to the GoLite Peak, which is described above. The main difference is the capacity, which is an amazing 50 L, which is definitely one of the largest you will find on a frameless backpack. If you want to a dyneema backpack and still carry a lot, the Jam is a great choice.</li>

<strong>Hiking in winter conditions is always going to be much different, and much less forgiving than hiking in summer conditions.</strong> In the winter you have a variety of concerns, most having to do with the cold, unpredictable weather, and before heading out in to all that it helps to consult a winter hiking gear list so you know you're not forgetting anything crucial.

In a lot of cases, the gear you use in the summer will be the same gear that you use in the winter. Your <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-stoves/\">stove</a>, for instance, or your <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/lightweight-water-filters/\">water filter</a> wont change much, though you might want to bring along a little extra food to help keep yourself warm.

There are a few other items, however, that you will want to swap out for warmer, winter versions of the same.
<h3>Winter Hiking Gear List</h3>
This list is by no means complete, but it should give you a good idea of what the essential items should be on any winter hiking gear list.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-tents/\">Winter Tent</a> - A winter tent isn't crucial, and depending on what the conditions are going to be like where you're going a summer tent might do the job fine. But if you're expecting wind and lots of moisture, or worse, have no idea what to expect, then it might be a good idea to bring along a beefier winter tent, if for nothing else than a little a peace of mind.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-bags/\">Winter Sleeping Bag</a> - A winter sleeping bag is going to be a lynch pin item in any winter hiking gear list. You can try and supplement your summer sleeping bag with a sleeping bag liner, but your best bet really is a whole different winter sleeping bag. When it comes to your sleep and your comfort in bed at night, you do not want to take any chances.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-sleeping-pads/\">Winter Sleeping Pad</a> - Another item that will help keep you warm at night is a winter sleeping pad. Not all sleeping pads are created equal, and a winter sleeping pad will have certain features, like down insulation, to keep your body from losing heat in to the ground at night.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10060&amp;pw=41369&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.backcountry.com%2Fstore%2Fsearch.html%3Fmv_session_id%3DwTVhoPso%26q%3Dsunscreen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sunscreen</a> - Most people hope for good weather when going winter hiking, but fail to include anything to protect that from that good weather on their winter hiking gear list. Sunscreen will help protect exposed skin, which can reflect off snow and burn you quickly. Also consider bringing along<a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10008&amp;pw=41369&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.campsaver.com%2Fmens-clothing%2Fmens-accessories%2Fmens-sunglasses\" rel=\"nofollow\"> sunglasses</a> so that you don't put yourself at risk for snow blindness.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">Winter Hiking Boots</a> - A good hiking boot is a must in winter conditions. Unless you're in a part of the world that gets some good winter weather, <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/winter-hiking-boots/\">backpacking shoes</a> should not make an appearance on your winter hiking gear list. They may weigh more, but it will be worth it to keep your feet dry and comfy. Also be sure to bring along a good pair of <a href=\"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&amp;mi=10248&amp;pw=41369&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rei.com%2Fsearch%3Fcat%3D4500230%26search%3DMen%2527s%26cat%3D4501773%26hist%3Dcat%252C4500230%253ASpecialty%2BSocks%5Esearch%252CMen%2527s%5Ecat%252C4501773%253AHiking%2Band%2BBackpacking%2BSocks\" rel=\"nofollow\">socks</a> and consider <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/hiking-snowshoes/\">hiking snowshoes</a> if you plan to be spending a lot of time in the snow.</li>
	<li><strong>Outer Layer </strong>- A good waterproof outer layer is a very important piece of gear when going hiking. Your outer layer should also be something that breaths, since you will be exerting yourself by hiking. Look for fabrics like Gore-Tex and eVent, which will both protect you from snow and rain and also let moisture escape.</li>
	<li>Insulating Layer - For those really cold conditions you should also consider an insulating layer to help improve whatever other clothes you have on. Mont Bell, a Japanese manufacturer, makes a few really great down insulating layers, including a men's <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\">down inner jacket</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>) and a matching pair of <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-tec-down-pants-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">down inner pants</a> (<a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/ul-down-pants-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">women's version</a>). Down isn't very good when weight, but makes up for that by being extremely light.</li>

If you have a backpacking enthusiast on your shopping list then there is nothing better than a backpacking gift for that person. New gear, after all, is one of the favorite things of any backpacker.

If your backpacking enthusiast happened to break a piece of gear, or has been complaining about a missing piece of gear, then that would make a great backpacking gift. <strong>If you're looking to surprise them with the kind of backpacking gear that they never knew they needed, however, a few items on this list might be just what you are looking for.</strong>
<h3>Backpacking Gifts List</h3>
Here are a few possible backpacking gift ideas to look over.
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-inner-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell Down Inner Jacket</a> (and the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/u-l-down-parka-women-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Women's version</a>) - Most backpackers tend to grab whatever warm layers they can find in their closet to shove in their backpack, so getting them a high quality insulating layer as a backpacking gift would be a great idea. These parkas from Mont Bell are just the thing. They're made with goose down, so they're far lighter than most other materials, and pack much smaller too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer</a> - SteriPEN is a company revolutionizing backpacking water filters. Most backpacking water filters are clunky and take a lot of work to keep clean, but the SteriPEN uses UV light to clean the water quickly and efficiently. The Adventurer is their most popular model.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/neoair-sleeping-pad\" rel=\"nofollow\">Therm-A-Rest NeoAir</a> - If your backpacking enthusiast has ever complained about not getting a good night's sleep while out backpacking, then this is the perfect backpacking gift for them. The NeoAir is probably the highest rated, most popular sleeping pad on the market, and if you cant get a good night's sleep on it then you shouldn't be backpacking.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/bear-canister\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bear Vault Bear Canister</a> - The average backpacker tends to hang their food from a tree to avoid bears, but bears are smart enough to get it down, and other animals don't even have to get it down to get at the food. A bear canister, however, will protect food from rodents, bears and anything else that doesn't have opposable thumbs, making it a great backpacking gift for the person who has seemingly everything.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/737697/benchmade-530-serrated-locking-knife\" rel=\"nofollow\">Benchmade 530 Serrated Locking Knife</a> - Most backpackers don't bother to take a backpacking knife with them on the trail, but should. It comes in handy in a variety of different ways around camp, and can also be a lifesaver in a variety of different emergency situations. This knife from Benchmade is made from high quality steel and is lightweight enough that you will forget you're carrying it until you need it.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/black-diamond-trail-trekking-pole\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Trekking Poles</a> - Trekking poles are an often neglected backpacking item, and for the backpacker who has everything, they make a great backpacking gift. Trekking poles take some of the load off the knees, which tend to suffer from the daily grind that is backpacking. These trekking poles from Black Diamond get rave reviews, and are adjustable to a wide variety of sizes.</li>

<h2>How Much Lighter are Lightweight Trekking Poles?</h2>
Trekking Poles are an under appreciated piece of backpacking gear. They aren't something that you'll find in the average backpacker's gear collection, but in certain situations they can be indispensable, and your knees will thank you for using them after a long day on the trail. <strong>And just like any other piece of gear, there are the light trekking poles and the heavy trekking poles.</strong> A quick glance at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/trekking-poles/\">list of trekking poles</a> shows that there is, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/contour-elliptic-shock-poles\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Contour Elliptic Shock Poles</a>, which weigh in at 664 grams, or 1.5 pounds. Then there is the <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/813391/black-diamond-ultra-distance-z-pole-trekking-poles-pair\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z Poles</a>, which weigh a mere 270 grams, or .6 pounds....
<ul>
	<li><strong>Black Diamond Contour Elliptic Shock Poles - 664 grams / 1.5 pounds
</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z Poles - 270 grams / .6 pounds
</strong></li>
</ul>
If you have to carry trekking poles, you might as well be carrying the lightest trekking poles, and the Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z Poles are a great deal lighter than the competition.
<h2>Common Features of Light Trekking Poles</h2>
There's only so much innovating you can do with a straight piece of metal that you poke the ground with, but if you take a look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/trekking-poles/\">list of trekking poles</a> you'll see that there is actually quite a difference in weights, despite the fact that there aren't all that many trekking poles on the market.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Carbon Trekking Poles </strong>- Innovative materials are usually good for a significant weight savings, and light trekking poles are no exception. Though carbon is a bit more prone to breaks in some situations than the more common aluminum trekking poles, the weight saved by switching to the lighter material is usually significant.</li>
	<li><strong>Fixed Length Trekking Poles </strong>- Most trekking poles, even most of lightest trekking poles are collapsible and expandable, which makes them easy to travel with and suited to a wide variety of heights. But all that extra material weighs something, and going without makes for some significant weight savings. A quick look at the <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/gear-lists/trekking-poles/\">list of trekking poles</a> shows that your options are limited for fixed length trekking poles, but they are out there.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Drawbacks of Light Trekking Poles</h2>
Carbon Trekking Poles do offer some small disadvantages, as carbon is a bit more prone to breaks than the more common aluminum trekking poles, but it's not a large difference, and the weight savings are going to make the trade off worth it for most people. Fixed length trekking poles are lighter still, but something to keep in mind is that you'll be stuck with one length if you plan to use your trekking poles as tent poles for a <a href=\"http://www.tenpoundbackpack.com/tarp-tents/\">tarp tent</a>. If the poles are a workable length, and they usually are, then this isn't a problem, but it's something to keep in mind when considering fixed length trekking poles."

<p><strong>Hiking Books are plentiful, but hiking books that tell you how to shed gear instead of add it on are hard to find, and the ones that tell you how to do it well are rarer still</strong>. </p>
<p>Below are a few of the better hiking books on the market. They&#39;ll explain how to do lightweight backpacking well and are a great supplement to the information you can find on this site.</p>

And this is the hiking book that helped do that popularizing. It was published way back in 1999 so it misses out on a few of the more recent innovations in the lightweight backpacking world, but it&#39;s still a hiking book worth having.</li>

Though it still misses out on a lot of the more recent innovations in lightweight backpacking despite being an updated text, it&#39;s still packed with a lot of good information and includes some things that the first one doesn&#39;t. That said, you probably don&#39;t need both of Jardine&#39;s hiking books, as there is quite a bit of overlap.</li>

In terms of flavor of hiking book, it&#39;s quite a bit different than Jardine&#39;s hiking books, focusing more on the gear available on the market. But lots of good information is available here too, and it&#39;s worth adding to your collection of hiking books.</li>

	<li><strong>Sawyer</strong> - Makers of a more niche product than some of the other water filter brands, Sawyer sticks almost exclusively to gravity filters. You can however buy the their filter without the extra equipment if you want to make your own water filtering system. Their most popular product though is probably the 2 Liter version of their <a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/786393\" rel=\"nofollow\">Complete Water Filter System</a>, which gives you everything you need for a gravity water filter system and weighs in at 453 g, or 1 lb.</li>
	<li><strong>SteriPen</strong> - Another manufacturer of a niche product when compared to other water filter brands, SteriPen sticks to UV water purifiers. Their most popular product is probably the <a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-classic-handheld-water-purifier\" rel=\"nofollow\">Classic Handheld Water Purifier</a>, which weighs on 162 g, or .35 lbs (without the batteries).</li>

<h2>Best Backpacking Water Filters</h2>
Best is a tricky idea to really pin down, but for the purposes of this list I've tried to go by a few criteria such as weight, reviews, reputation, and features to judge which are the best backpacking water filters.

Here are a few of the best backpacking water filters that fit the criteria.
<h3>Best Backpacking Water Filters List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/hydro-photon-steripen-adventurer-opti\" rel=\"nofollow\">SteriPEN Adventurer Opti</a> - If you're looking for the new great thing I would highly suggest the UV water purifiers made by SteriPEN. The Adventurer Opti is one of their newer, lighter designs, but all the SteriPEN models work on the premise of using UV light to neutralize all the nasty stuff in your water. Keep in mind that it doesn't filter the water, but anything from a spare shirt to a bandana can be used as a crude sort of filter. The one downside to something like this is that you'll end up needing to replace batteries every now and then. If new and innovative is what you judge the best backpacking water filters to be then check out the Adventurer Opti.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/hyperflow-water-filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Hyperflow</a> - A classic pump filter made by MSR, who have been making water filters for a while now. The Hyperflow won a Backpacker Magazine Editor's Choice Award in 2008 for best backpacking water filter and is the second lightest pump filter on the market, only 11 grams behind first place. An all around serious contender in the best backpacking water filters category.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/720265/katadyn-hiker-pro-water-filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Katadyn Hiker Pro</a> - From a well respected brand in all kinds of water filtering technology, the Hiker Pro is another pump filter only slightly heavier than the Hyperflow. It gets a lot of very positive reviews and is an all around great choice for best backpacking water filters.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/gravity-works-filter\" rel=\"nofollow\">Platypus Gravity Works</a> - If you're looking for something a little different in terms of water filtering than the Gravity Works might be for you. Gravity filters are generally only used while you're stationary, so if you break for lunch at a water source or prefer to have all your water filtered in the morning so you're ready to go the next day, a gravity filter might be a good choice for you. The Gravity Works is the lightest gravity filter on the market and Platypus is well known for their water carrying devices.</li>

<h2>Best Bivy Bags</h2>
The best bivy bags for backpacking is a hard thing to define, but for the purposes of this list I've decided to base it on a few criteria like weight, reviews, reputation, and features to round out what the best bivy bags available are.

Below are a few of the very best bivy bags that fit under those criteria.
<h3>Best Bivy Bags List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/moonlite-bivi-sack\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Moonlite Bivi</a> - The Moonlite bivy is one of the lighter bivy bags on the market. It's made by Terra Nova, a lesser known but quality manufacturer out of the UK. If you're looking to go fast and light and not too worried about the weather then the Moonlite is the perfect choice from this list of best bivy bags.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/twilight-bivy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Black Diamond Twilight</a> - The Twilight by Black Diamond is one of Black Diamonds lighter offerings in the bivy bag department. It's a minimalist design like the Moonlite above and is again a good choice if you're not too worried about the weather.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.mountainlaureldesigns.com/shop/product_info.php?cPath=22&amp;products_id=173\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain Laurel Designs eVENT Bivy</a> - A eVENT top and a Cuben Fiber bottom make this offering from Mountain Laurel Designs a very innovative option. The combination of the two fabrics means the bivy bag will be waterproof all around but breathable through the top. If dryness and weight are features you think the best bivy bag should be defined by then consider this bivy bag.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/integral-designs-south-col-bivy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Integral Designs South Col eVent Bivy</a> - Another eVENT bivy bag, this one from Integral Designs. While the Cuben Fiber of the Mountain Laurel Designs will make for a delicate bag, the nylon bottom of the South Col makes it much more puncture resistant and all around more robust. If your best bivy bag is something waterproof that will take some use and abuse then definitely consider the South Col.</li>

<h2>Popular Tents</h2>
<strong>A tent is one of the most important pieces of gear that you take with you when you go backpacking, hiking or camping, and you should take the time to choose right.</strong> Starting with the well reviewed, popular tents is a good way to narrow the field down and make your choice a lot easier.

Here are a few of the most popular tents currently on the market, broken down in to a couple different categories to help you find the right lightweight tent for you.
<h2>Popular Tents - 1 Person</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/779612/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 1</a> - The Fly Creek 1 from Big Agnes qualifies as one of the lightest free standing tents currently being manufactured. It weighs just 850 grams, or 1.87 pounds, which is a big part of the reason that it is such a popular tent with backpackers and hikers. But it doesn't sacrifice quality for weight either, which is another reason it's such a popular tent. It gets excellent ratings for being easy to set up and keeping you dry inside too.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.altrec.com/terra-nova-equipment/laser-photon-1-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terra Nova Equipment Laser Photon 1</a> - The Laser Photon 1 is another extremely lightweight tent, this time from UK manufacturer Terra Nova. The Terra Nova product line isn't so popular with North Americans, but is well known to Europeans, and with good reason. This one person tent weighs in at just 670 grams, or 1.47 pounds, which makes it an extremely popular tent. Terra Nova is so dedicated to minimizing weight that the the tent actually comes with its own, exclusive tent pegs that have been specially developed for minimal weight. That's a manufacturer that cares about their products and their customers.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/contrail.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Contrail</a> - The Contrail is one of the lightest designs from popular tent manufacturer Henry Shires, who is the man behind the Tarp Tent brand. You wont find these tents at your local outdoor store, but they're extremely popular with lightweight backpackers. The innovative design means that the tent weighs only 696 grams, or 1.53 pounds, and is also hand made right in the USA.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popular Tents - 2 Person</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/msr-carbon-reflex-2-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR Carbon Reflex 2</a> - The Carbon Reflex 2 is one of the lightest tents from MSR. It won an Adventure Gear of the Year award back in 2009 from National Geographic, which has made it an extremely well reviewed and popular tent. It weighs 1210 grams, or 2.66 pounds, which is respectable for a two person tent.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/fly-creek-ul-2-tent-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 2</a> - The Fly Creek 2 from Big Agnes is much the same as the Fly Creek 1, the only real difference being room for 2 instead of just 1. It weighs just slightly more than the 1 person version, coming in at 963 grams, or 2.12 lbs, which is a big reason it's such a well reviewed and popular tent. It's also easy to pack, set up, and regularly gets 5 out of 5 ratings.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/crescent-2-shelter-2-person-3-season\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mont Bell Crescent 2</a> - The Crescent 2 from Mont Bell has a unique, single pole design that helps to cut down on weight. Mont Bell, which is a company that produces many extremely popular sleeping bags and down clothing garments also make a few other products that don't get a lot of attention, but should, like the Crescent 2. It weighs just 1162 grams, or 2.56 pounds, and edges out many products from the more established names in the tent world in terms of weight. It's also roomy and, owing to its unique design, includes ample ventilation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Popular Tents - 3+ Person</h2>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-3-tent-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 3</a> - The Fly Creek 3 is the 3 person version of this popular line of tents from Big Agnes. The jump in weight is a little bigger than from the 1 person to the 2 person version, coming in at 1445 grams, or 3.18 pounds, but it's still signiifcantly lighter than most other tents you'll look at, which is why it is such a popular tent. There is also a 4 person version, the <a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-ul-4-tent\" rel=\"nofollow\">Big Agnes Fly Creek UL 4</a>.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.tarptent.com/rainshadow2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tarp Tent Rainshadow 2</a> - The Rainshadow 2 is another popular tent from lightweight backpacking manufacturer Tarp Tent. The innovative design, which you're not likely to see on any of the tents at your local outdoors store, provides ample room for three, as well as enough ventilation to keep the inside of the tent dry from the condensation created by the breathing of three people. It also weighs only 1135 grams, or 2.5 pounds, which is lighter than many of the 2 person tents listed above.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/777755/rei-base-camp-6-tent\">REI Base Camp 6</a> - If you want something big with a price that wont empty your wallet, the Base Camp from REI's in house brand is ideal. There's room inside for 6, of course, and the price is lower than many 4 person tents, so you're getting a good deal. It's not exactly lightweight, at 17 pounds 3 ounces, or 7.8 kilograms, but then if price is your main concern, weight probably isn't going to be too important. There's also a few key features, like two doors and plenty of ventilation, which are key when you get in to larger tents like this.</li>

For even one night in the wilderness, backpacking requires a lot of equipment.

<strong>That's why it's always a good idea to consult or construct a backpacking checklist before you set out.</strong> It helps you to make sure you haven't forgotten anything important, so you can have fun in the outdoors instead of compensating for gear that you've forgotten.

Here is a good backpacking checklist template to consult.

<strong>A camping towel can be a useful piece of gear to have along when you want to take a dip in a lake, river or even the ocean.</strong> You wont find any cotton camping towels, however. Some exotic materials allow camping towels to be lightweight, highly absorbent and fast drying, which makes them the perfect lightweight item for staying dry while hiking, backpacking or camping.

Here are a few of the more popular camping towels and backpacking towels found on the market.
<h3>Lightweight Camping Towels List</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/798319/msr-packtowl-original-medium-towel-30-x-12\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR PackTowl Original</a> - The original camping towel from MSR. It comes in four different sizes so you've got plenty of choice, and it does the job of a camping towel extremely well. The largest size is advertised as being able to soak up a liter of water, and then to be able to release 90% of that liter when you wring it out. Not bad at all.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.backcountry.com/sea-to-summit-drylite-towel\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sea to Summit DryLite Towel</a> - Sea to Summit is an Australian manufacturer that makes a lot of high quality camping and backpacking products, and judging by the many positive reviews, the DryLite towel is one of them. It's made of soft micro-fiber that is lightweight, absorbs a lot of water and drys extremely fast. It also comes in five different sizes, so no matter how much or how little towel you're planning to bring with you, there's an option for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/packtowl-personal\" rel=\"nofollow\">MSR PackTowl Personal</a> - This second backpacking towel from MSR is another lightweight, highly absorbent camping towel option. It also comes in four different sizes, so there's something for everyone. The smallest size is only 28 grams, or 1 ounce, while the largest is 240 grams, or 8.5 ounces. It also gets excellent reviews, and would make a good choice for a camping towel.</li>

<strong>Fleece jackets make excellent jackets for beating back the wind and keeping water from penetrating too deeply.</strong>

The best fleece jackets, however, set themselves apart form the competition with a few extra technical features here and there that make them better designed than the competition.
<h3>Best Fleece Jackets - Men</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.campsaver.com/monkey-man-jacket-men-s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mountain Hardwear Monkey Man Jacket</a> - The name says it all. This fleece jacket is made from extremely soft, plush fleece, which makes it both lightweight and very warm. It doesn't have the density to block a lot of wind like other fleece jackets, but if you're looking for the best fleece jacket for laying, this is the one for you.</li>
	<li><a href=\"http://www.rei.com/product/754925/marmot-afterburner-fleece-jacket-mens\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marmot Afterburner Fleece Jacket</a> - This fleece jacket from Marmot features Gore Windstopper fabric, which does as the name suggests and keeps the wind at bay.

<p>The point of Ten Pound Backpack is to help you save weight when putting together a collection of gear for backpacking, hiking or even just camping. This pursuit of a lighter backpack is often called lightweight backpacking, or ultralight backpacking.</p>
<p>It seems crazy, after all, to put together a backpack that weighs 50 pounds, for instance, when you could put together the same backpack, for the same trip, and have it weigh 20 pounds instead. In fact you would have to be crazy to opt for the 50 pound option.</p>
<p>And lightweight backpacking really is better than the backpacking that most people do, what you might call unnecessarily heavy backpacking. When you take all that weight off of your back you get to enjoy the outdoors more. You stop stooping over, just counting the steps until you get to drop your backpack, and you start to look around a little more, and really appreciate where you are.</p>
<p>You also feel a lot better at the end of a long day. Backpacking starts to become fun. You start to understand what can be so appealing about trekking out in to the wilderness, because you&#39;re doing it with a lightweight backpack.</p>
<p><strong>And that&#39;s what Ten Pound Backpack is all about. Making your backpack weigh less, so you can enjoy the outdoors more.</strong></p>
